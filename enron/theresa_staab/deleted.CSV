One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look

******* DON'T OPEN THE ATTACHMENT UNTIL YOU READ THE JOKE

A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead show up for the same job interview.

The brunette is the first one to go in, and after filling out the forms
and
going through the questions, the interviewer decides to ask her a last
question: ""How many D's are there in ""INDIANA JONES""""?

The brunette thinks for a second and responds ""One"". The interviewer
sends
her back with a promise that he'll get back to her after he had
interviewed
the remaining candidates.

The redhead is the next one, and the process goes about the same, and at
the
end: ""How many D's are there in INDIANA JONES"". She immediately says
""One"".

The interviewer says ""ok, we'll let you know"".

Then the blonde comes into the room, goes through the questions, and
finally
gets asked ""How many D's are there in INDIANA JONES"". She gets a very
serious look on her face and starts counting her fingers, muttering:
""2, 4, 6 ..hmmm - wait... 2, 4, 6 .... can I borrow your calculator
please?

After going through 15 minutes of intense calculating, she finally comes
up
with the answer: ""Thirty two""

The interviewer is stunned and asks her: ""Ok, now tell me, how the hell
did
you arrive at this answer?""

Theresa,

The pricing for deal # 1020259 (buy from BP at Anschutz Plant) does not agree with the price invoiced by BP for Nov. 2001.  BP invoiced a rate of $2.5401. Sitara currently has IF NWPL Rockies + $.02 less $.09 (MCF conversion). Can you please review and advise?

Thanks,
Genaro

Subject: The Letter 

This is really good 

To Osama and the Boys, from an American Wife and Mother 
             
            Yo, Osama! 

            Well, the government finally named you as a suspect, so I 
guess it's fair to talk about you now.  Thought you had us, didn't you? 
What a laugh!  You did more to unify this country than George 
Washington. 



            See, we Americans had gotten sort of distracted.  We 
worried about things like lockboxes, taxes, and who was committing hanky 
panky with whom.  We were too stressed to reach out to one another, to 
sit down and talk with our kids, to call our spouses at work and tell 
them we loved them.  We were MUCH too busy to even think about giving 
blood or going to the hardware store to buy and hang an American flag. 



            You changed all that, Osama, you and your gang of creeps. 
I met my neighbors in the park across the street tonight.  We talked 
quietly while everybody gathered.  Then we lit our candles and just 
stood there silently, holding them.  Without anybody saying anything, we 
walked back to our neighborhood and set them on our doorsteps.  They are 
still burning.  You will never be able to put them out. 



            See, Osama?  You think you get ticked off when someone 
messes with your culture, your beliefs, your country?  Just wait a 
minute you flea bitten miserable excuse for human DNA!  You haven't seen 
anything like the anger of a MOTHER who's son has to go off to defend 
their homeland against your cowardice and hatred. You haven't seen 
anything like the WIFE of a fireman, policeman or EMT who clings to hope 
wondering if he'll ever return from trying to help his fellowman in your 
moment of destruction. 



            You haven't seen anything like the WOMAN who will keep her 
family, and her neighbors family, and her best friend's family, and 
country's family going when hope and energy falls low.  You haven't seen 
anything like the good OLE GIRL who weeps tears of agony for family's 
she's never known or never will meet, just because she cares. 



            You think the American MEN are bad?  You just better thank 
your lucky stars that you aren't dealing with one of us American WOMEN 
right now.  Trust me, the men are the ones showing restraint.  I have 
heard the best ideas of just how graphically you need to be disposed of 
lately in the beauty shop, nail salon and the grocery store lines. 



            I've had more meaningful conversations with my teenager 
this week than in the last couple of years combined.  Tonight I was 
driving her to a friend's house when the voice of Lee Greenwood came 
over the radio singing ""I'm Proud to Be an American.""  We were stuck in 
traffic, and normally we would have been snapping at one another.  She 
started singing along softly with the radio.  I joined in.  By the 
second verse we were singing at the top of our voices with the windows 
rolled down.  People stuck in traffic on either side of us joined in. 
By the time we were finally able to move a little, perfect strangers 
were wiping their eyes, blowing their horns and shouting good wishes to 
one another. 



            I hung an American flag on my house yesterday for the first 
time in my life.  I'd like to get another one, but there are no flags or 
anything else red, white, or blue left in any store in this town.  My 
daughter and I did find some white and blue ribbon in the sewing box. 
Tomorrow we're going to make a huge blue-and-white bow and fasten it to 
the front grille of the car. 



            I called my husband at work today just to tell him I loved 
him.  I hadn't done that for a while - too busy, I guess.  It felt 
wonderful.  We are going to send some money to a fund to help the 
victims.  Tonight at the dinner table we talked about the various 
charities and tried to decide which one was best.  Normally we just eat 
and run.  It was the best dinner table conversation we've had in a long 
time.  We finally decided on a fund that's been set up for the children 
of the rescue workers who were killed in New York City.  We'd never 
given much thought to appreciating all they do for us before now. 



            My husband and I are on a waiting list to give blood. 
It'll be awhile before our names come up; there are over 500 people 
ahead of us.  There's been a shortage of blood in this area.  I wouldn't 
be surprised if the blood donated all across this country eventually 
saves more people than you killed.  That would be a fitting memorial to 
those who died. 




            We're sticking together. Our politicians are rising to the 
occasion. Rudy Giuliani and George W. Bush never looked half as 
statesmanlike as they have this week.  Partisan bickering?  What's that? 
 Half the Congress stood on the steps of the Capitol the other night and 
sang ""God Bless America."" 



            See, Osama, you underestimated us. And maybe for too long 
we've been underestimating ourselves.  This is the greatest, strongest, 
richest, most beautiful country in the world.  Our firefighters, 
policemen, EMTs, and people like the ones on the plane that crashed in 
Pennsylvania have reminded us that we're also the bravest and most 
determined. 



            You can't destroy us, and you can't stop us.  Because we're 
coming, Osama. 



            Just thought you oughta know.  And, just to show you how 
good hearted we Americans are, I will end by saying THANK YOU.  Not for 
the lives taken, for which we now mourn, nor for the destruction, but 
for instilling back into the hearts of every American, young and old, 
black, white, red, or yellow, what we always knew deep down.  We are 
strong. We are brave.  We are ONE NATION, UNITED UNDER GOD.  We will 
overcome this as we have always overcame those moments that tested our 
very being. 



            And, Osama, I say this, all the while asking God to forgive 
ME, for I do not feel any compassion or have any mercy on your soul, 
but...may you and all your cowardly friends soon sit happily in those 
front row seats you have reserved in Hell.

Latest NFL Player News 

Elvis Grbac  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01 
Grbac will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . He threw very little in practice and is still suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is unable to play. 

Randy Moss  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to play on Sunday. 

Tony Martin  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01 
Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution reports that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes. 

Wane McGarity  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=133355&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints have signed McGarity, who was released by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity has minimal value now, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' regular rotation of receivers. 

Matt Stover  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1377&>, K BAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Eric Metcalf  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1283&>, WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value. 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1082&>, RB CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01 
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1116&>, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01 
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12306&>, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1028&>, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=188491&>, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=187621&>, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.

Randy Moss  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12576&>, Active WR Updated 10/25/01 
Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achilles tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday but is expected to play on Sunday. 

Matt Stover  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 10/25/01 
Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. 

Hines Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.

Joey Galloway  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1286&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Kevin Dyson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=12342&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01 
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Tony Richardson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1471&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.

Tiki Barber  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1782&>, Active RB Updated 10/22/01 
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Tim Couch  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=133260&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/19/01 
Couch probably won't complete a high percentage of his passes but should throw at least one TD pass. Consider benching him this week if you have a QB on your roster that has a more favorable matchup. 

Wesley Walls  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1321&>, Active TE Updated 10/18/01 
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against Washington. 

Terrell Owens  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1290&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01 
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.

Saints  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=18&>, Active DT Updated 10/14/01 
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Rich Gannon  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1034&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01 
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Jerry Rice  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1291&>, Active WR Updated 10/12/01 
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.

Dwayne Carswell  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1328&>, Reserve TE Updated 10/12/01 
Carswell is a good start this week. Seattle's defense has always been vulnerable to tight ends over the middle.

Richie Anderson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1231&key=1141&>, Reserve RB Updated 08/28/01 
Anderson has returned to practice after suffering a concussion in last week's preseason game. Keep him in mind as a No. 4 Fantasy RB.

Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. ""Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Up! da! ted 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week."" Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1471&>, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! ht! tp://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens! Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.

Rob Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1076&>, RB ATL - Really Rottens Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throug! ho! ut the week. 

Justin McCareins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=235117&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=235023&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scr! ip! t=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1324&> , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared hims! el! f fit enough to play. ""I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready."" 

Redskins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1593&>, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons! Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Quincy Carter <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday.! H! e is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/http! :/! /football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid repl! ac! ement. 

Doug Chapman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=187510&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3300&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walkin! g ! with a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence.

Subject:	RE: Denver Visit

I will be out the 19th but should be in the 20th.  Amy Felling should be your contact on the 19th.  She is most familiar with our computer systems.

The Enron North America offices are at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750 in Downtown Denver.
The office is over 9,000 Square Feet but is currently under construction in order to sublease approximately half of that space.
We currently have 6 employees.
I believe that you have copied all of the Enron offices that I know of.

The only other potential office is EOTT.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Subject:	Denver Visit

Mark, Brian, and Steve,
	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedule a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking at the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are focusing our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing IT back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Trent Green <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1599&>, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.

Ken Dilger <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.

Marcus Pollard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scr! ip! t=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1335&> , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=133320&>, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.

Reggie Wayne <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=235256&>, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start ! in! place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1231&>, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.

Peyton Manning <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=12531&>, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=! ge! tbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/18/01
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1593&>, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 1! 0/! 18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1663&>, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good we! ek! if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.

Curtis Martin <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

Stephen Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367! &k! ey=1440&>, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1310&>, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz ! Up! dated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.

Walter Rasby <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1320&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end ! no! w that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point. 

Rod Gardner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=133310&>, WR STL - President Taft Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scrip! t=! players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1294&> , WR STL - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=12797&>, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalt! er! isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive of the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=187621&>, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football! 21! 5.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Blue Balls Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Gloria,
Is there any way you could copy and send overnight to me the CIG invoices for the 33175000 contract from May, 2000 through January, 2001?

I am helping Darla and Megan reconcile the Citizens account.  It is changing over to Kinder Morgan effective Dec. 1 and we need to reconcile this account rather quickly.

I printed all other invoices on the Internet from CIG's website but they only go back 9 months.

Let me know if this is possible or where else I might find these.

Thanks,
Theresa

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

I know you're busy so I'll keep this short.

We have our walk through tomorrow (Friday) and hopefully we can close early - Monday or Tuesday.  Otherwise we're scheduled to close on Thursday the 20th.  Everything looks good so far.   I believe our phones are getting hooked up on the 20th so I will finally have long distance service again.  

Our new address is 2264 E. 101st Ave., Thornton, CO  80229 and the phone # is (303) 450-1626.


Take Care and stay strong (I know you will - You are the strongest person I've seen!)

Please email me back and let me know how things are going and if you need anything!

Love,
Theresa

Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.

Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=921&key=1248&""><B>Cris Carter</B></A>, WR MIN - Luccis Losers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching.

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Todd Heap <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Heap practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland. Reserve Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep him inactive until he is effective in a game. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=146325&>, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elb! ow! , as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago. 

Peerless Price <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=133393&>, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1072&>, RB! B! UF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1041&>, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return. 
! Tyrone Wheatley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee. ""Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks. ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's unc! er! tain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play. 

Brian Griese <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. 

Redskins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprai! ne! d ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two days. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1515&>, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad  <http://football209.fantasy.spo! rt! sline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! ht! tp://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
! Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updat! ed! 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
! The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=134327&>, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1230&>, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't f! in! d his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1032&>, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=425! 2&! key=1236&>, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1222&>, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

! Tyrone Wheatley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1140&!>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Randy Moss <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=12576&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Joey Galloway <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1286&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Tony Richardson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1471&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tiki Barber <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1782&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Hines Ward <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=12795&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38 yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Terrell Owens <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1290&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.

Saints <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=18&>, Active DT Updated 10/14/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Rich Gannon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1034&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/12/01
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Jerry Rice <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1291&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.

Wesley Walls <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1321&>, Active TE Updated 10/12/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against New Orleans. 

Rickey Dudley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1357&>, Reserve TE Updated 10/09/01
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Tim Couch <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=133260&>, Active QB Updated 10/05/01
Couch has been inadequate as a starter, mainly because his receivers have struggled to get open. Look for this trend to continue when he faces the San Diego. 

Richie Anderson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1141&>, Active RB Updated 08/28/01
Anderson has returned to practice after suffering a concussion in last week's preseason game. Keep him in mind as a No. 4 Fantasy RB.

Derrick Mayes <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1227&>, Reserve WR Updated 07/04/01
Published reports have stated that Mayes could be signed by the Kansas City Chiefs within the next week. Mayes, who played for the Seattle Seahawks last season, would compete for the No. 2 wideout spot should he sign a contract with the team. The Chiefs are also reportedly interested in Charlie Jones and Kirby Dar Dar, and it is expected that they will sign at least one them as well. Mayes has the talent to be a good reserve wideout on your Fantasy team, but he's worth no more than a late-round flier at this point. 

Matt Stover <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4252&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 12/08/00
Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Subject: John McCain's Speech


From a speech made by Capt. John S. McCain, US, (Ret) who represents
>Arizona in
>the U.S. Senate:
>
>As you may know, I spent five and one half years as a prisoner of war
>during the
>Vietnam War. In the early years of our imprisonment, the NVA kept us in
>solitary
>confinement or two or three to a cell.
>
>In 1971 the NVA moved us from these conditions of isolation into large
>rooms with
>as many as 30 to 40 men to a room.
>
>This was, as you can imagine, a wonderful change and was a direct
>result of the
>efforts of millions of Americans on behalf of a few hundred POWs 10,000
>miles from
>home.
>
>One of the men who moved into my room was a young man named Mike
>Christian.
>Mike came from a small town near Selma, Alabama. He didn't wear a pair
>of shoes
>until he was 13 years old. At 17, he enlisted in the US Navy. He later
>earned a
>commission by going to Officer Training School. Then he became a Naval
>Flight
>Officer and was shot down and captured in 1967.
>
>Mike had a keen and deep appreciation of the opportunities this
>country-and our
>military-provide for people who want to work and want to succeed. As
>part of the
>change in treatment, the Vietnamese allowed some prisoners to receive
>packages
>from home. In some of these packages were handkerchiefs, scarves and
>other items
>of clothing. Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple
>of months,
>he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt.
>
>Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's
>shirt on the
>wall of the cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance. I know the Pledge of
>Allegiance
>may not seem the most important part of our day but, now I can assure you
>that in
>that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event.
>
>One day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and
>discovered
>Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it. That evening
>they returned,
>opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all us, beat Mike
>Christian severely
>for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and
>threw him
>in. We cleaned him up as well as we could.
>
>The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we
>slept. Four
>naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room. As said, we tried to
>clean up
>Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in
>the corner of
>the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of
>red cloth,
>another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He
>was sitting
>there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making
>another
>American flag.
>
>He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better.
>He was
>making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able
>to pledge
>allegiance to our flag and our country
>
>So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget
>the
>sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our
>nation
>and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our
>honor,
>and our country.
>
> ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and
>to
>the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,
>with
>liberty and justice for all.""
>
> PASS THIS ON... and on... and on!!!!!!
>
> HOW MANY CAN YOU SEND IT TO?

Player Updates NFL Reports  	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1515&>, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01 
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the way."" Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas. 

Edgerrin James  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=133320&>, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/26/01 
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4. 

Derrick Alexander  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01 
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets. 

James Hodgins  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week. 

Todd Heap  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235248&>, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/25/01 
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury. 

Terry Allen  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01 
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive. 

Jason Brookins  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shannon Sharpe  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Freddie Jones  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01 
Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report. 

Hines Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game. 

Charlie Batch  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12204&>, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals. 

O.J. McDuffie  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01 
Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1254&>, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/25/01 
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills. 

Chad Morton  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=187613&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain. 

Marco Battaglia  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 

Chad Johnson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy. 

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01 
Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.

Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox

web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron 
Guru."" 


PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

"How Are You Doing?","Hi Jeff,
I hope you get my message.  How are you doing?  How long will you be in the hospital in Germany?

I sent a package to your house with presents for the boys and some Western dressing for you.  I bet it will be there this week some time.  I sure hope things get better before Christmas!!!!!!!!

I'll keep my email short so you'll have time to read others since it doesn't seem like you get much time to use the internet.

We have our walk thru on our house Friday the 14th and can hopefully close on Monday or Tuesday the 17th or 18th.  I will be getting our phone hooked up on the 20th between 8:00 and 12:00 noon.  I can try and call you after that.  Joyce and Paul don't have long distance service for out of the country. 

Our new phone # is going to be (303) 450-1626 and our address is 2264 E. 101st Ave.

Take Care and DO EVERYTHING THE DOCTOR SAYS!  (I know how you can be :)  

Love,
Theresa

"FW: 4 presidents go to oz and...","


The last 4 US Presidents are caught in a tornado, and off they  spin to OZ. 
After threatening trials and tribulations, they finally  make it to the 
Emerald City and come before the Great Wizard.  
Jimmy Carter steps forward timidly: "" I've come for some courage.""  
""NO PROBLEM!"" says the Wizard, ""WHO IS NEXT?"" 
Ronald Reagan  steps forward, ""Well.., I... think I need a brain."" 
""DONE"" says the  Wizard. ""WHO COMES NEXT BEFORE THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ?"" 
Up steps  George Bush sadly, 'I'm told by the American people that I need a  
heart."" 
""I'VE HEARD ITS TRUE,"" says the Wizard. ""CONSIDER IT  DONE."" 
Then there is a great silence in the hall. Bill Clinton is  just standing 
there, looking around, but doesn't say a word.  
Irritated, the Wizard finally asks, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" 
""Is  Dorothy here?

Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1310&""><B>Michael Westbrook</B></A>, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1003&""><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=12623&""><B>Michael Pittman</B></A>, RB ARI - Dont Mess <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries.

Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - President Taft <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1265&""><B>Keyshawn Johnson</B></A>, WR TB - Orange Roughy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01!

FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again.

The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=133228&""><B>Marty Booker</B></A>, WR CHI - Luccis Losers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=187385&""><B>Plaxico Burress</B></A>, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards.

Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/28/01
Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."" 

Emmitt Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1094&>! , ! RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01
Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=133263&>, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.

Eddie Kennison <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/28/01
Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. 

Mike Anderson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/28/01
Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard ! ru! n, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.

David Patten <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1790&>, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/28/01
Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.

Troy Brown <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1253&>, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/28/01
Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.

Curtis Conway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1204&>, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/28/01
Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.

Freddie Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01
Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.

Larry Centers <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1072&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/28/01
Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.

Peerless Price <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=133393&> , WR BUF - Texas Terminators Updated 10/28/01
Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/28/01
Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.

Shaun Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/28/01
The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01
Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

James McKnight <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Texas Term! in! ators Updated 10/28/01
McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.

Ron Dayne <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/28/01
Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Amani Toomer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/28/01
Toomer caught nine passes for 10! 9 ! yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.

Stephen Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/28/01
Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.

Tony Banks <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/01
Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.

! Charlie Garner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/01
Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.

Rich Gannon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/28/01
Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.




Donovan McNabb! , QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season. <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=133361&>Michael Pittman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/28/01
Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.
David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/28/01
Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.

Jake Plummer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.

Cowboys <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.

C! li! nt Stoerner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

Emmitt Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.

Rob Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1234&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/28/01
Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained 73 yards Sunday.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1152&""><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - Blue Balls <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=12436&""><B>Skip Hicks</B></A>, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the <I>Nashville Tennessean</I>
. ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1070&""><B>Gus Frerotte</B></A>, QB DEN - Really Rottens <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.</FONT>

He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1681&""><B>Corey Dillon</B></A>, RB CIN - Texas Terminators <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1025&""><B>Scott Mitchell</B></A>, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=133415&""><B>Akili Smith</B></A>
, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1177&""><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a ha!
nd!
 injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT>
</FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=12375&""><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - President Taft <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1645&""><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1186&""><B>Bert Emanuel</B></A>, WR DET - Blue Balls <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup this week against Pittsburgh.

Rice had a solid game against San Diego, posting six catches for 93 yards and a touchdown. Rice has once again become a solid Fantasy player in Oakland, and will help many owners during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Couch had a terrible game against Jacksonville, posting only 184 yards passing with an interception. He is far too unreliable to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' offense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

"Update From American Airlines","Dear Theresa Staab,

I promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide an update on the
situation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation Safety
Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and
flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the
accident.

In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a
precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail
fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on
Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed
approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any
problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for
the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will
communicate those results.

On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone
for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's
tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The
unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire
nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11. 

I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge
to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident
but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing
across our system.

On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle,
thanks for your support.

Sincerely, 

Mike Gunn
Executive Vice President
American Airlines

Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason. He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. <BR>

Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Rice had a solid game against San Diego, posting six catches for 93 yards and a touchdown. Rice has once again become a solid Fantasy player in Oakland, and will help many owners during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' offense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Cornerback Kevin Mathis missed practice on Wednesday due to a neck injury. ""I've been trying to play through it, but I think it has caught up with me,"" Mathis told the <I>Times-Picayune</I>. ""I start out the game fine, but after about the second tackle, the pain comes back immediately."" Mathis is questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina, which could be good news for Fantasy owners with Panther receivers on their roster. <BR>

Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. <BR>

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Dear priceline.com customer,

So what do you do if you have to plan a trip on short notice or even the same day? Come to priceline and Name Your Own Price  <http://priceline1.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB4582406957X1126366X80920X>SM. You can save as much as 60% over the lowest fares you can find -- it's one of the few times when waiting until the last minute can actually pay off!

"Important Information About Security & ClickAtHome","
Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!
__________________________________

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"RE: Crestone 10/00","Theresa:
I found the offset for the 10/00 Crestone sale.  The deal was reversed under Enron Midstream and rebooked as Crestone.  I will net the two invoices for a zero balance.  You do not need to look any further.  Sorry if I caused you some work.

Megan,
I'm not sure why this is showing up.....I think it must have something to do with the name change from Enron Midstream to Crestone....

Let me pull out my Oct 00 file and see what invoice # we finalized then because I'm pretty sure they paid us.

I'll try and get to this later today.

Thanks,
Theresa

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01 
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the way."" Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas. 

Edgerrin James  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=133320&>, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/26/01 
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4. 

Derrick Alexander  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01 
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets. 

James Hodgins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week. 

Todd Heap  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235248&>, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/25/01 
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury. 

Terry Allen  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01 
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive. 

Jason Brookins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01 
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shannon Sharpe  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Freddie Jones  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01 
Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report. 

Hines Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game. 

Charlie Batch  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12204&>, QB DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01 
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals. 

O.J. McDuffie  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01 
Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1041&>, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01 
The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills. 

Chad Morton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=187613&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain. 

Marco Battaglia  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 

Chad Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/25/01 
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01 
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy. 

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01 
Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.

Latest NFL Player News

Corey Bradford <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=187388&>, TE GB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major! s! coring threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1599&>, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsl! in! e.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=187510&> , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

! Michael Pittman <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1264&>, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=235249&>, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/! 21! /01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder)! s! tarted Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2! 87! 7&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=235248&>, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1372&>, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards ! an! d a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver. 

Charlie Batch <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=12204&>, QB DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.! 

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&rando! m=! 2877&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.

Albert Connell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1851&>, WR NO - Uran Man Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1234&>, WR NO - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-! qu! ality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers. 

Hines Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Anthony Becht <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=187740&> , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

J! er! ome Bettis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=2877&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had! a! huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

"FW: FW: FW: thoughts","




The closest I ever got to a 4.0 in college was my blood alcohol content.

I live in my own little world. But it's OK ... they know me here.

I saw a woman wearing a sweatshirt with ""GUESS"" on it.   I said,
""Implants?""

I don't do drugs any more 'cause I find I get the same effect just
standing up really fast.

Sign in Chinese pet store: ""Buy one dog,   get one flea.""

I got a sweater for Christmas . . . I wanted a screamer or a moaner.

I don't approve of political jokes . . . I've seen too many of them get
elected.

The most precious thing we have is life, yet it has absolutely no
trade-in value.

I love being married.   It's so great to find that one special person
you want to annoy for the rest of your life.

Shopping tip: You can get shoes for 85 cents at the bowling alley.

I married my wife for her looks ... but not the ones she's been giving
me lately!

Two peanuts were walking down the street. One was a salted.

If carrots are so good for the eyes, how come I see so many dead rabbits
on the highway?

Isn't having a smoking section in a restaurant like having a peeing
section in a swimming pool?

Marriage changes passion ... suddenly you're in bed with a relative.

When next time you feel like complaining, remember: Your garbage
disposal probably eats better than thirty percent of the people in this
world.

Snowmen fall from Heaven unassembled.

Every time I walk into a singles bar I   can hear Mom's wise words:
""Don't pick that up, you don't know where it's been!""

Many people will walk in and out of   your life, but only true friends
will leave a footprint on your heart

Please take a look at the pricing in Sitara versus your spreadsheet. I'm faxing you copies of the invoices that are in the system; I've recently redrafted this morning. The volumes tie, so the pricing must be off somewhere.

Thanks!

"FW: bad joke. <G>","


Subject: Fwd: bad joke.  <G>

A bald man with a wooden leg gets invited to a  
Halloween party. 
He doesn't know what costume to wear to hide his  bald 
head and his leg 
so he 
writes to a costume company to explain  his problem. 
A few days later he received a parcel with the  
following note: 
Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a pirate's outfit.  
The spotted handkerchief will cover your bald head 
and, with your  
wooden 
leg, you will be just right as a pirate. 
Very truly  yours, Acme Costume Co. 
The man thinks this is terrible because they  have just 
emphasized his 
wooden 
leg and so he writes a letter of  complaint. A week 
goes by and he 
receives 
another parcel and a  note, which says: 
Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a monk's habit. The  
long robe will cover 
your 
wooden leg and, with your bald head, you  will really 
look the part. 
Very truly yours, Acme Costume Co.  
Now the man is really upset since they have gone from 
emphasizing  his 
wooden 
leg to emphasizing his bald head so again he writes 
the  company another 
nasty letter of complaint. 
The next day he gets a  small parcel and a note which 
reads: 
Dear Sir, 
Please find the  enclosed bottle of molasses. Pour the 
molasses over 
your 
bald  head, stick your wooden leg up your hinnie and go as 
a caramel apple.  
Very truly yours, 
Acme Costume Co  >>

"Enron Travel Park Training 10/16","Hi Team!

You are all invited to sit in on the Enron Travel Park training.  Details are below:

DATE:		Tuesday, October 16th
TIME:		11am to approximately 1:30pm
TOPIC:		How to use Enron's travel system on-line and via phone
HOSTS:	Tracy Ramsey (Enron) and Zou Cherry (Travel Agency in the Park)


If you plan to attend, please respond back to this note ASAP for a few reasons:

1.  We will be bringing in lunch and I need to know how many to order

2.  I will need to get you set up in their system prior to Tuesday

3.  I will need to ensure we are set with laptops and other training materials

To give you an idea about the kind of savings you can get by using this Enron feature, here's an example.  I booked a roundtrip flight from Denver>St. Louis which came up as $161, but with the Enron discount, I am paying $119.  As a comparison, on the United website, the same exact trip came in at $302.

Thank you,
Kristen

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"07/01  FUGG","Have you adjusted the 07/01 for FUGG yet?  I was just wondering
what kind of time frame you are looking at.  We have an interconnect
between WIC and FUGG for 07/01 for 28,481.  

Also,  what about the unify imbalance problem with FUGG that
we discussed while you were here?  

If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  
I was wondering if it would help you if I actualized the current
months, if that would allow you to have time to work on the 
past problems.  
Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

Three men are sitting naked in the sauna. 
Suddenly there is a beeping sound. The first 
man presses his forearm and the beeping stops. 
The others look at him curiously. 

""That's my pager,"" he says. ""I have a microchip 
under the skin of my arm."" 

A few minutes later a phone rings. The second 
man lifts his palm to his ear. When he finishes 
he explains, ""That's my mobile phone. I have a 
microchip in my hand."" 

The third man, feeling decidedly low-tech, steps 
out of the sauna. In a few minutes he returns with 
a piece of toilet paper extending from his 
rear. The others raise their eyebrows. 
""I'm getting a Fax,"" he explains.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI 

I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. 

Answer - GG 

Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. 


Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA 

Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. 

Answer - GG 

Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. 


Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO 

I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? 

Answer - GG 

Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

Latest NFL Player News

Todd Pinkston <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187621&>, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.

Joe Jurevicius <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=62! 0&! key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be availa! bl! e,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for ! Su! nday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. ! He! was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable! m! atchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getba! d&! owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will ! ac! tivate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on ! 11! carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline! .c! om/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football209.! fa! ntasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.

"Weather Forecast Rain","Good Morning,
Well, it looks like you definitely will need to bring rain coats, umbrellas etc.  I just checked the 10 day forecast and it shows rain or scattered showers Wed. 11/21 - Sun. 11/25.  The local forecasters are showing rain for Thanksgiving here.   Hopefully it will change before then, last week they said it was going to rain this weekend and now it's going to be sunny and 70's. 

Love,
Mom

Subject:	Denver Deals

Paul,

Could you set aside some time today to talk to me about the recent Kennedy Oil deal in addition to 2 other deals.  These other deals were discovered in our bid week preparations, and are causing our desk some pretty big negative Prior Month Adjustments.  So, we need to get these resolved.  The first one is the Williams / wic deal. The deal #'s for that are 121890,854562, & 1068893.  The reason for the split of this deal is b/c our books changed names.  The second deal in question which needs to be resolved a.s.a.p. is a Red Rock Energy LLC deal #133661.  This deal is being booked to Denver in Sitara, but in Tagg the risk is going to Keith Holst and Mike Grigsby.  

Please look over these deals and let me know when a good time to talk will be.  Thank you!

Carole C, Frank

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Subject:	Greeley Gas actuals

Valerie,
I just wanted to let you know Logistics is working on actualizing a few days in September to correct the volumes allocated to each specific Greeley deal.  Jackie Adams is trying to get this done today.  The numbers in my spreadsheet by deal (bucket) are correct and we are waiting for the corrections in the system.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

"FW: Martha Stewart Thanksgiving...this is funny","

A Change in Plans

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

Once inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with
the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make. Instead,
I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in
colorful autumn leaves from the front yard. The mud was their idea.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have
made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please
remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering
that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to
the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the
children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or
that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes
dryer, ignore them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm
sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit
of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a
separate room, next door.

Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at
our dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private
ceremony. I stress ""private"" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter
the kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small,
unsuspecting children to check on my progress. I have an electric knife. The
turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win. When I
do, we will eat.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that
""passing the rolls"" is not a football play. Nor is it a request to bean your
sister in the head with warm tasty bread. Oh, and one reminder for the
adults: For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence
of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its
lesser-known name: Cheese Sauce. If a young diner questions you regarding
the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance. Cheese Sauce stains.
Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small
fingerprints. You will still have a choice; take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either. I am thankful.

Okay Guys -  Call me CRAZY!

I don't know what I did, but I had the wrong Gas Daily pricing in the spreadsheet for September.

Please accept my apology... One would have thought I'd have this down pat by now.

Sorry about this.  I hope this is the last revision for September.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Subject: Enron Greeley Contracts


Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald?  We need to get these contracts signed.
I am having problems reconciling with Thersa's invoices.  I have paid the
amount reflected on the invoices even through I did not agree for April,
May, June, and July.  I short paid the August invoice.  This is not a good
situation to be in without a contract.  I am not sure where Greeley and
Enron stand with each other especially in light of the difficulties I am
having reconciling the invoices.  
I do not want either party(Greeley or Enron) to find themselves in a
situation that would end up in arbitration.  Talking on the phone or
exchanging worksheets has not proved to be the most efficient way to settle
these differences.  Do you have any sugestions on how we can get the
contracts executed and the invoices reconciled before the deal terminates at
the end of October?   


Thanks...Robert

Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Hasselbeck is scheduled to start the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Miami due to a groin injury suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. ""Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.

Trent Dilfer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/16/01
Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week."" Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.

Tony Richardson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1471&>, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! ht! tp://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/16/01
Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.

Lamar Smith <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/16/01
Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.

Brian Griese <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens! Updated 10/16/01
The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.

Rob Johnson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Jamal Anderson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=g! et! bad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1076&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throug! ho! ut the week. 

Justin McCareins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=235117&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards. 

Eddie Berlin <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=235023&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams, will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.

Dennis Northcutt <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week. 

Peter Warrick <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Marco Battaglia <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scr! ip! t=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1324&> , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared hims! el! f fit enough to play. ""I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready."" 

Redskins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day. 

Duce Staley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/16/01
Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1593&>, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons! Updated 10/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go. 

Joey Galloway <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game. 

Reggie Swinton <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day. 

Jackie Harris <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Quincy Carter <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday! . ! He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01
Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise. 

Tiki Barber <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Michael Pittman <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/http! :/! /football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/16/01
Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again. 

Randy Moss <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/16/01
Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid repl! ac! ement. 

Doug Chapman <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=187510&>, RB MIN - Team Dick Updated 10/16/01
Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense. 

Michael Bennett <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1895&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/16/01
According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walking! w! ith a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence.

It probably won't be available until after the Holiday.   The reason I say that is because we haven't received the bill from Public Service yet. 

Are you out any time from now until the end of the month?

Subject:	Path Manager Rewrite / Optimization project
Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

The sooner we get someone to devote to this, the better off we will be.  I expect these changes that we'll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit.  

That being said, we've identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of Path Manager.  

1)  Currently, the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids.  I can't think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step?    It runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn't find a match.  I know Patti has mentioned this several times and I can't think of a valid reason for performing this work.  I talked with Dave Nommensen, and according to him, what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place???  From a scheduling perspective, my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it.  If you were overpathed, you'd see it in the Path Manager either way. [Pinion, Richard]    To restate the question for clarity, in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply, market and a service, adds any up/downstream contract information and/or Duns or DRN override and then saves it.  Unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re-uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id.  I had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted.  Has this changed???  At one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations.  Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used.  I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs this to occur.  Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected.  Therefore, if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify, I don't think that this constant old path look up is needed.   [Kinsey, Lisa]   Get rid of this.  

2)  The scheduling position window:  does anyone use this?  If not, we'll remove the code logic that populates this window.  I have never seen a scheduler use this.  Please verify. [Pinion, Richard]   Originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system ""Autonoms"" so it was duplicated in Unify by request.  It is not used in Unify now because of the other sophisticated tools Unify provides which obviate it's use.  The only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems.  As voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - Lose it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Why is this still here?	 

3)  On the inventory pool list, does anyone need to see the Contarct References List?  Again, this code is called every retrieval time and doesn't appear to be used from my observations.   If they do need this information, we could provide it, but if not, I'd prefer to remove the functionality. [Pinion, Richard]    This function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool.  Keep it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Yes.  We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools.	 

4)  When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths, what's the average number of paths they create at one time?  What about updates?  I know that ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to.  Does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records?  My real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and Inserts.  By update, I mean, going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be created. [Pinion, Richard]    This one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline.  There is no 'average'.  They typically update a path with up/downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however.  I hope this answers your question.  I see no change to this process at this time  [Kinsey, Lisa]  On some pipes this function is used more than others.  When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible.  At this time I do not see a need to change this process. 	 

5)  On brokered paths, do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Service?  In other words, when updating Brokered arrangements, we don't incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated?  Why do we do this for service?  Is it because we have to renominate it?  I assume that's what it's for since we don't send brokered paths to the pipe.  Anyway, with the Nomlogic implmentation (two way interface), we were planning on having it behave the same way as service.  We need this verified. [Pinion, Richard]    We don't perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path.  I don't see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time. [Kinsey, Lisa]  Agree with Richard.

 THINGS I'VE LEARNED FROM MY CHILDREN...(HONEST AND NO KIDDING)

 1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house
 4inches deep.


 2. If you spray hairspray on dust bunnies and run over them with
 rollerblades, they can ignite.


 3. A 3-year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant.


 4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong
 enough to raise a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a Superman
cape. It is enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to
 spread paint on all four walls of a 20 by 20 foot room.


 5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on.  When
using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before
 you get a hit.  A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.


 6. The glass in windows (even double pane) does not stop a baseball hit by
a ceiling fan.


 7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words ""Uh-oh,"" it's already too
 late.


 8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.


 9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a
 36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies.>

 10. Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a
four-year-old.


 11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.


 12. Super glue is forever.

first grade teacher was reading the story of the Three Little Pigs to her class.
 She came to the part of the story where the first pig was trying to
 accumulate the building materials for his home.  She read, ""...And so the
 pig went up to the man with the wheelbarrow full of straw and said,
""Pardon me sir, but may I have some of that straw to
 build my house?""  The teacher paused then asked the class, ""And what do
you think that man said?""  One little boy raised his hand and said, ""I think
he said 'Holy Shit! A talking pig!""  The teacher was unable to teach for the
 next 10 minutes.

"RE: Greeley Gas actuals","Theresa,

Did you get my message from yesterday? They still haven't changed the volume on deal 703165. It doesn't match your spreadsheet. Let me know what you want to do. 

Thanks!

Valerie,
I just wanted to let you know Logistics is working on actualizing a few days in September to correct the volumes allocated to each specific Greeley deal.  Jackie Adams is trying to get this done today.  The numbers in my spreadsheet by deal (bucket) are correct and we are waiting for the corrections in the system.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

"CAEM Predictions for 2002","Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets


Wow!  What a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition.   For every good bit of news (Pat Wood, one of our heroes at CAEM, being selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the continuing progress that the Canadians ? yes, the Canadians ? have made towards energy competition), we have had to bear one disaster and misstep after another throughout the year.   Let?s see, in December 2000, who could have predicted?.

1.  The tragic events of September 11th.
2.  The California implosion.
3.  Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment.
4.  Price volatility and high prices (but it could have been worse if Mother Nature did not help out).
5.  Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring.
6.  Enron collapse.
7.  FERC Blinks on Super RTO.
8.  Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market.
9.  No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring.

2001 was one heck of a year ? but thankfully, probably the nadir of the movement towards energy competition in North America.  As CAEM looks into our crystal ball (natural gas fired, of course) for the coming year, we see a better year.  Below are some of the predictions and responses from the CAEM staff about what we expect to occur.  The responses below are primarily concerned with electricity, but to a lesser extent, may be applied to natural gas as well.

As always, do not bet the house on what we have to say.  We are just a little think tank, kind of like the little engine that could.  And we can.  And we do.

Happy New Year!		

The CAEM Staff

P.S. If you would like to add a prediction or two, please send an e-mail with your name and contact information to Hope Duncan at hduncan@caem.org  We will post them to our web site ? www.caem.org  Please identify which question below is being addressed by your prediction.

CAEM PREDICTIONS IN 2002

What does Enron?s collapse mean?

1. Markets work.  Markets quickly punish mistakes.  Little slack is given for past accomplishments.  Markets are ruthlessly impersonal. 

2. No likely short term impact on consumers, other traders will fill the space left by Enron.  Amazing that a company as large as Enron can fail and hardly cause a ripple in markets.  Testimonial to benefits of markets. 

3. May have significant impact on public policy advocacy.  Not obvious who picks up the slack.  Enron could be counted on to be there, or so it appeared.  No more free riders, we will all have to dig deeper and work harder.  Consumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses, which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition.  

4. Enron?s collapse was not caused by deregulation. Viewed thoughtfully, it should not have any effect on deregulation movement.  Does not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy. 

5. Look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions, accounting and business practices.  A strange legacy for Enron, but a reality. 

6. As a practical matter, it is another setback for restructuring.  But not as bad as portrayed by media ? Enron was the 600 pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes, thus making them less willing to step forward.  Will feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring. 

7. Enron?s global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred (pro-wholesale? pro energy services?) Other corporations will now replace Enron in public policy debates; these corporations may have a clearer focus.  

8. Still, we have lost a champion.  CAEM will miss their culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations, which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract (or paper or water, etc) into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one. Enron also pioneered risk assessment and control systems. 

What will be the fate of the movement towards retail energy competition in 2002?


1. CAEM believes that the movement toward retail energy competition will continue ? albeit much more slowly. 

2. Texas is the best model to date and will set the standard for other states in 2002 and beyond.  Why?  The best incentives are in place for large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers to competitively shop for supply.  The Texas model ties changes to the wholesale market to the retail market.  (Texas, through ERCOT, is unique in this respect.)  No price caps.  Market power of incumbents is limited.  Enlightened leadership at the Texas PUC from 1995 to 2000 (our friend, Pat Wood again ? but we believe Commissioner Perlman is a star as well) and in the Governor?s office. 

3. Other states that have already made a decision to move forward will seek to correct deficiencies ? Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc. ? or avoid past mistakes altogether ? Virginia.  However, there will be very limited movement in these states. 

4. California will continue to suffer from a lack of imagination and poor leadership from the Governor on down.  There is a good chance that CAEM will again be awarding Governor Davis the ?Red China? award in 2002. 

5. Californians will be reminded again that rolling blackouts are a form of ?involuntary? conservation. 

6. Very limited movement, perhaps some experimentation or demonstration projects, in those states that have done nothing to date. 

7. Increasing effort to approximate market-like conditions, but under a regulated, cost-based system, with predictable results.  

8. Actually, beyond Texas, the best hope for significant movement towards competition is in North America is in Canada, particularly Alberta and Ontario.  Given the increasing interconnection between the U.S. and Canada, this will slowly work its way into the United States.  

9. It will be another wild ride for energy marketers in 2002.  More power to them. 

What will happen on the wholesale side of the picture in 2002?


1. CAEM believes that there will be significant strides made to increase liquidity and competition in the wholesale market for electricity. 

2. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be successful, to a degree, in implementing Super RTOs (regional transmission organizations). 

3. CAEM supports the Bush Administration?s proposal to give eminent domain to FERC for the siting of new transmission lines.  However, this proposal faces tough sledding in Congress.  CAEM believes it will pass in some form ? probably very watered down ? out of necessity, but not out of love. Many in Congress still believe we can conserve our way to prosperity. 

4. The Federal government and the states will make progress ? probably embodied in a political deal ? on greater cooperation.  This will be regional in focus.  Both sides will give significant concessions to realize this.  

5. New players will enter market as it grows, including the oil companies and more foreign-based companies. 


Wildcards/ Predictions in 2002


1. The Bush Administration will come under increasing pressure to show leadership in the area of energy restructuring.  To date, the Bush Administration has stayed on the sidelines ? except making the right noises here and there ? of making energy markets more competitive.  This will need to change, beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting FERC in their efforts on the wholesale side. 

2. The new Electricity Advisory Board appointed by DOE Secretary Abraham will be seen for what it is ? a sop to campaign supporters.  Given its current make up, we expect very little to come of it.  Couldn?t they find more energy marketers, technology companies ? anyone that is a bit more pro-competition? 
3. The Department of Energy will continue to have little impact -- if any -- on energy restructuring issues and will remain largely irrelevant to the competitive energy market. 

4. The Department of Energy will continue to fight for tougher appliance efficiency standards, while totally ignoring the far lower efficiency of electricity production, thus marginalizing its impact on energy efficiency. 

5. ?Comprehensive? energy legislation will probably pass in 2002.  The question is whether it will be truly comprehensive and have a separate and new section devoted to electric restructuring.  (The Senate version does and the House is working on one.)  Our guess is that it will to some degree.  Our hope is that the energy legislation moves beyond pork politics and members of Congress will resist the temptation to earmark projects.  Fat chance of that happening, but it is Christmas time. 

6. As part of the political deal, there is the opportunity for a ?New Federalism? policy to be realized for the energy sector.  If the Bush Administration truly wants to move competition forward, and yet have the states go along with it, a new block grant with conditions for moving towards competition could be formed to serve as a carrot.  The Feds do it with highway funds and education ? why not energy? The states, familiar with federal block grants for highways and education will try to cut as many of the ?strings? attached to the grants as possible. 

7. A major blackout in 2002.  The laws of probability suggest that we are due for a reminder about how old our infrastructure is and how the lack of attention to how these markets are performing will have consequences.  The U.S. has dodged many bullets in the past ? but probably not this year. (BPA will likely not cause the blackout this time, as it did twice in 1996, unless the Pacific Northwest gets a lot of snow this winter or a lot of rain this spring.) ( The blackout will likely not happen in Manhattan, since peak demand was reduced by ~ 300 mW on September 11th.)  We recognize this a risky prediction ? predicting what terrorists or what the weather may do always is ? but it is only a matter of time. 

8. The environmental movement will begin to wake up to the fact that its interests are not the same as those of consumer activists.  Competition will lead to more efficient production ? and thus less pollution ? to the extent it is allowed to occur.  Seeking lower prices at all costs, including the cost to the environment, consumer advocates want to preserve the monopoly model, which has led and will continue to lead to the maximum use of old, and polluting technologies and infrastructure. 

9. For that matter, the anti-coalition (kind of like anti-matter, not much there) of critics should splinter even further vs. organized labor (high costs, high prices). 

10. New grid-enhancing technologies, e.g., superconductivity, and distributed energy technologies, e.g., fuel cells, should make significant market gains in 2002, assuming Congress, DOE and EPA take no further actions to prevent this from happening.  There is a lot of pessimism in the distributed energy community right now ? and who wouldn?t be a bit pessimistic, given the exit of Honeywell from the market, the constant technical setbacks, the wariness of the utilities, the bickering and backbiting, etc.  But folks, this is the future ? and the future starts now. 

11. EPA will continue to protect the ?right? of existing generators to pollute at rates an order of magnitude greater than the pollution rates required of new generators, ?in the interest of fairness?. 

12. EPA will continue to discourage incremental improvements in the efficiency and emissions of existing power plants by insisting that the incremental improvements subject the plants to new source review. 

13. EPA will proceed with issuance of a proposed guidance document requiring combined heat and power systems and building cooling, heating and power systems to achieve better combined electrical and thermal efficiency than the best available separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion technologies, but will not require that all separate electric generation and thermal energy conversion installations use the best available technology. (No one will question why this efficiency requirement is coming from EPA and not DOE.) 

14. The tax code will continue to require owners of on-site generation systems to depreciate the systems over time periods longer than their expected useful lives.

Covington will backup Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he receives playing time. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

""There are concerns,"" coach Jeff Fisher said. ""He hasn't responded like we'd hoped. He's still pretty stiff."" McNair first experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last w!
ee!
k. In the first quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened up. However, he stayed in the game and led the Titans to a 26-20 victory. Even McNair is unsure of his status for Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,"" he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair this week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a major risk.   </FONT>

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the ! st! retch.

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasse! lb! eck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=get! ba! d&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick ! Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they wil! l ! activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards o! n ! 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12342&>, WR TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
! Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football215.fantasy.sportsli! ne! .com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football215! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3044&key=1041&""><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - Blue Balls <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe.

Hi Theresa,
I now have daily access to e-mail. I'm staying at a
home which is nice. I had therapy today after they did
an epedural in my back. They will give me injections
in the line they left in my back for five days.
Hopefully after that I will be able to do therapy
without the nerve pain block. Vicky and the boys went
back to Holland today and she thinks that she will be
back next week sometime. What is the deal with your
job now? Are they going to keep the company running?
Thats the way it sounds like here. The best thing for
me right now is that I'm out of pain. Well, I will
keep in touch. Jeff

Latest NFL Player News

Michael Pittman <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/29/01
Pittman suffered a concussion in Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to day.

James Stewart <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1116&>, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/29/01
Stewart was inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at RB for the Lions.




Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/28/01Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1265&>Emmitt Smith <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01
Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133263&>, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.! 

Eddie Kennison <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Dont Mess Updated 10/28/01
Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. 

Mike Anderson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/28/01
Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.

David Patten <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1790&>, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/28/01
Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.

Troy Brown <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1253&>, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/28/01
Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.

Curtis Conway <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink! ?s! cript=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1204&>, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 10/28/01
Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.

Freddie Jones <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01
Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.

Larry Centers <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1072&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/28/01
Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.

Peerless Price <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133393&>, WR BUF -! D! Rock's Beaatchs Updated 10/28/01
Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/28/01
Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.

Shaun Alexander <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Update! d ! 10/28/01
The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01
Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

James McKnight <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/0! 1
McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.

Ron Dayne <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/28/01
Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Amani Toomer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/28/01
Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.

Stephen Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/28/01
Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.

Tony Banks <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Righ! t,! now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.

Duce Staley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/01
Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.

Charlie Garner <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/28/01
Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.

Rich Gannon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 10/28/01
Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.

Donovan McNabb <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 10/28/01
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.

Michael Pittman <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/28/01
Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.

David Boston <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 10/28/01
Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.

Jake Plummer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 10/28/01
Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the match! up! dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.

Cowboys <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.

Clint Stoerner <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4282&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

Okay Guys -  Call me CRAZY!

I don't know what I did, but I had the wrong Gas Daily pricing in the spreadsheet for September.

Please accept my apology... One would have thought I'd have this down pat by now.

Sorry about this.  I hope this is the last revision for September.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Peerless Price <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league! =g! etbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1072&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1041&>, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than ! he! hoped and there's no timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee. ""Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks. ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar Kin! g.! Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. 

Redskins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235174&> , QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn ! Je! fferson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is! l! isted as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start. 

Shane Matthews <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you! s! tart any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5! &r! andom=3411&key=1230&>, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1032&>, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too produ! ct! ive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1222&>, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantas! y ! team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Travis Henry <http://football215.f! an! tasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235216&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12576&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Joey Galloway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Tony Richardson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1471&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1782&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Hines Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12795&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38 yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Terrell Owens <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1290&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.

Saints <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=18&>, Active DT Updated 10/14/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Rich Gannon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1034&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Jerry Rice <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1291&>, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.

Wesley Walls <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1321&>, Active TE Updated 10/12/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against New Orleans. 

Rickey Dudley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1357&>, Active TE Updated 10/09/01
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Tim Couch <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=133260&>, Active QB Updated 10/05/01
Couch has been inadequate as a starter, mainly because his receivers have struggled to get open. Look for this trend to continue when he faces the San Diego. 

Richie Anderson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1141&>, Active RB Updated 08/28/01
Anderson has returned to practice after suffering a concussion in last week's preseason game. Keep him in mind as a No. 4 Fantasy RB.

Derrick Mayes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1227&>, Active WR Updated 07/04/01
Published reports have stated that Mayes could be signed by the Kansas City Chiefs within the next week. Mayes, who played for the Seattle Seahawks last season, would compete for the No. 2 wideout spot should he sign a contract with the team. The Chiefs are also reportedly interested in Charlie Jones and Kirby Dar Dar, and it is expected that they will sign at least one them as well. Mayes has the talent to be a good reserve wideout on your Fantasy team, but he's worth no more than a late-round flier at this point. 

Matt Stover <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 12/08/00
Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.

"FW: I've found inner peace","

Tuesday humor;  I think we can all relate!


I think I've found inner peace.
My therapist told me a way to achieve inner peace was to finish things I
had
started.  Today I finished 2 bags of potato chips, a lemon pie, a fifth of
Jack Daniels and a small box of chocolate candy.
I feel better already.
Pass along to those who need it.

"Put up $5 to win $1 Million!","<!--
Do you know football? Would you pay $5 to enter an office
pool with a $1 Million grand prize? There are 3 weeks left
in the pro football season and someone is GUARANTEED to win
$1 Million in the Office Pool Challenge. There's still
plenty of time left for you to win, so sign up today!

http://poolchallenge.fantasy.sportsline.com/?r=esfb1225_opc

It's easy to play. Just predict which teams will cover the 
point spread each week.

If someone picks every game right in a week, that person is 
entered into a random drawing with everyone else who made 
""perfect picks"" during the season. If no one makes ""perfect 
picks"" - and so far no one has - then the 17 weekly high 
scorers are entered into a drawing for the $1 Million prize.
With 3 weeks left, you still have 3 chances to make perfect
picks or be one of the weekly high scorers... maybe you'll 
win all three weeks!

Someone is guaranteed to win $1 Million. With 3 weeks to go,
there's no reason it can't be you. Other prizes are up for 
grabs too - so SIGN UP TODAY and give it a shot!

Adjusted purchase price s/b $209,159,347.
Build up of this number is
$204,000,000 purchase
+$4,000,705 estimated true-up
+$1,158,642 Friday final settlement

Number does not include the estimated 109K due from Westport.

The Payment schedule goes like this

NBP owes $1,158,642 through the true-up
ENA owes $1,937,200 throught the exec contract

These amounts will be netted with ENA left paying a total of $778,558.
On Oct. 1 ENA will pay $669,600.  (this is the normal wire payment for executory contract ---  $21,600 per day for 31 days)
On Nov. 1 ENA will pay 108,958 which is the balance.

These payment due not include any dollars owed due to the outstanding June and July Westport revenue payment estimated at $109,000.  Its just a coincident.    

Also, we would like to add a short statement which indicates ENA continued agreement in providing backup documentation on some the expenditures NBP has agreed to pay.  
Thanks.

Fantasy Football Matchups 

Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week.

We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA 

Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? 

Answer - GG 

As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. 


Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL 

I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend? 

Answer - GG 

Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game. 


Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE 

Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks? Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available. 

Answer - GG 

Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Player Updates NFL Reports  	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1082&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1116&>, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01 
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=12306&>, WR DET - Team Dick Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1028&>, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1676&>, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=187621&>, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=133247&>, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01 
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01 
According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01 
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01 
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Team Chick Player News 

Hines Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=12795&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.

Joey Galloway  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Tony Richardson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1471&>, Active RB Updated 10/22/01 
Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.

Tiki Barber  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1782&>, Active RB Updated 10/22/01 
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Randy Moss  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=12576&>, Active WR Updated 10/19/01 
Moss practiced Thursday for the first time since aggravating an ankle injury on Sunday, and has been upgraded from questionable to probable on the injury report for Sunday's game against Green Bay. You should definitely get him into your active Fantasy lineup as a result.

Tim Couch  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=133260&>, Active QB Updated 10/19/01 
Couch probably won't complete a high percentage of his passes but should throw at least one TD pass. Consider benching him this week if you have a QB on your roster that has a more favorable matchup. 

Wesley Walls  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1321&>, Active TE Updated 10/18/01 
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against Washington. 

Terrell Owens  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1290&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01 
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.

Saints  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=18&>, Active DT Updated 10/14/01 
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Rich Gannon  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1034&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01 
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Jerry Rice  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1291&>, Active WR Updated 10/12/01 
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.

Rickey Dudley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1357&>, Active TE Updated 10/09/01 
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Richie Anderson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1141&>, Active RB Updated 08/28/01 
Anderson has returned to practice after suffering a concussion in last week's preseason game. Keep him in mind as a No. 4 Fantasy RB.

Derrick Mayes  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1227&>, Active WR Updated 07/04/01 
Published reports have stated that Mayes could be signed by the Kansas City Chiefs within the next week. Mayes, who played for the Seattle Seahawks last season, would compete for the No. 2 wideout spot should he sign a contract with the team. The Chiefs are also reportedly interested in Charlie Jones and Kirby Dar Dar, and it is expected that they will sign at least one them as well. Mayes has the talent to be a good reserve wideout on your Fantasy team, but he's worth no more than a late-round flier at this point. 

Matt Stover  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=966&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 12/08/00 
Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.

Latest NFL Player News

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12429&> , QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/12/01
Trent Dilfer will start at quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks for one more week while Hasselbeck recovers from a groin injury, coach Mike Holmgren said Thursday. Hasselbeck, who has a pulled left groin, practiced Wednesday, but sat out Thursday's practice. 

Reidel Anthony <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1860&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Anthony practiced Wednesday despite a left shoulder contusion, and he is expected to play Sunday at Tennessee. However, he hasn't been a main receiving threat for the Bucs this season, so don't use him in a Fantasy league. 

Dave Moore <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Moore missed Wednesday's practice with a right ankle sprain, but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Tennessee. He hasn't proven a reliable Fantasy tight end thus far, so don't use him this week. 

Jacquez Green <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12405&>, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
Green did not practice Wednesday due to an injured left groin, but he is expected to play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you use him against the tough Titans secondary this week.

Warrick Dunn <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Dunn participated in light running drills Wednesday and could practice Thursday or Friday, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Provided he has no problems with his sprained right foot, Dunn could play Sunday in Tennessee. We don't recommend you take your chances, and instead only use Dunn this week if he is clearly going to get the majority of the carries at running back. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1226&>, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01
According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, talk out of Packers practice is that Freeman will get more passes thrown his way in the next few games. We're not convinced Brett Favre will stop throwing the majority of his passes to Bill Schroeder as long as Schroeder remains productive, but there's a good chance Freeman might yet be able to help Fantasy teams this season. Just don't start him against the stifling Ravens defense this week. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with both neck and back injuries, but he has returned to practice this week. He lacks the consistency to help Fantasy leaguers on a regular basis, so avoid starting him if possible. 

Chris Chandler <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, is expected to start this week for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in some short-yardage packages.

Patrick Jeffers <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1515&>, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Jeffers might finally return to the Carolina lineup this week. He is close to full speed, says the Charlotte Observer. ""He's still working his way into being ready,"" Seifert said. ""He's starting to capture my imagination."" 

Marcus Robinson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1676&>, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/11/01
Robinson participated sparingly in practice because his surgically-repaired back remains sore from playing on artificial turf last Sunday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times . He isn't on the Bears' injury report, and we think he'll have a solid Fantasy week. Feel free to use Robinson if he doesn't suffer a setback.

Shane Matthews <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
The Bears listed Matthews as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a rib injury. He will serve as the No. 3 quarterback at best, so don't use him as a Fantasy starter right now. 

Fred Baxter <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1355&>, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Baxter is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona with a hip injury. He's a questionable Fantasy player to begin with.

Damon Washington <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=146364&>, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Washington (shoulder sprain) practiced on Wednesday. As of now, it looks like he might be asked to start at halfback against the Rams. 

Ron Dayne <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Dayne (neck) did not practice on Wednesday. Right now, it does not appear that he will play against St. Louis.

Tiki Barber <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Barber did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday, and as of now, it does not appear he will play against the Rams. 

Frank Sanders <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01
Sanders did not practice on Wednesday because of a quadriceps injury. His current status is day to day.

Robert Thomas <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=134236&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Thomas suffered a lacerated finger during practice on Wednesday. However, the Dallas fullback is probable for Monday's game against Washington. Thomas has no real value as a Fantasy player. 

Saints <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=18&>, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson could miss Sunday's game against Carolina with a strained left quadriceps. He'll be listed as doubtful, but there is an outside chance that he'll play. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01
Hasselbeck (groin) has started taking the snaps with the first-team offense and is listed as probable on the Seahawks' injury report. Although no official decision has been announced, a healthy Hasselbeck would likely get the start over Trent Dilfer this week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/11/01
Davis returned to practice and worked with the scout team. He is making cuts without pain, and there is a chance he could return in early November. ""I'm not going to put a target date on it,"" Davis told the Denver Post. ""I'm just going to go through this week, evaluate it and see where I am at the end of this week, and we'll go from there. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs are preparing to play Sunday's game without Alexander, who still has a back problem. ""It's not structurally damaged from a nerve standpoint, but they can definitely see why there is some soreness from the MRIs,"" Dick Vermeil said. ""He's just got to work through it."" Chris Thomas will probably start in Alexander's place. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=235256&>, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01
Wayne might be asked to make his first pro start this week. Jerome Pathon is expected to sit out with a foot injury, and Terrence Wilkins is questionable with a rib problem. Newly-signed Tony Simmons might work as the third receiver. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Wilkins is questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland with a rib injury. Jerome Pathon (foot) might also sit out, leaving Indianapolis thin at wideout against the Raiders.

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12783&>, K IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Vanderjagt has not kicked since having a toenail removed last week. But he is expected to play against the Raiders on Sunday night.

Terry Glenn <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Glenn has returned to practice. The Patriots are not sure when he will be ready to play, but might have a good indication of his progress by the weekend. 

John Hall <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1705&>, K NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01
Hall left practice with a back injury. His current status is day to day, although there are no plans for an MRI.

Derrick Mason <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1816&>, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/11/01
Mason worked out in the beginning of practice Wednesday but his ankle was so sore that he had to stop. He is listed as questionable for this week's game. 

Eddie George <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/11/01
George did some light running, but did not practice Wednesday. ""Eddie was better by the end of practice. He is still sore,"" head coach Jeff Fisher told The Tennessean. ""He is doing more than what I thought he would do considering where he was after the game."" Fisher also added that George would be a game-time decision if he doesn't practice on Thursday or Friday. The Titans will use Skip Hicks and Mike Green in his place if George is inactive. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Hines Ward <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01
Ward was held out of practice Wednesday to let a toe injury heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable.

Robert,
I'm working on this right now.  What do you show as the storage
schedule?

I have 2 different ones.  I know you changed it.  I just want to make
sure we're both on the same schedule.  

I'll just make sure my volumes on storage match with the schedule and
then I can send them all to you.
Thanks,

Theresa

Thersa,
Can you send me your revisions with the discounted price and commodity
charges applied to the planned storage injections today or tomorrow?  I
really need that ASAP to see if our numbers are getting any closer.  
I believe that the fuel calculations are being taken into account for
the
planned storage injections for the whole path from CIG through WIC and
into
Young Storage.  I was planning on calling you after I saw your
revisions.


Thanks...Robert

** High Priority **

  IF I HAD MY LIFE TO LIVE  OVER
   I would have invited friends over to
   dinner even if the carpet was
   stained and the sofa  faded.
   I would have eaten the popcorn in
   the ""GOOD""  living room and
   worried much less about the dirt
   when someone  wanted to light a fire
   in the fireplace.

   I would have  taken the time to
   listen to my grandfather ramble
   about his  youth.

   I would never have insisted the car
   windows be  rolled up on a
   summer day because my hair had just
   been teased  and sprayed.

   I would have burned the pink candle
   sculpted like a rose before it
   melted in storage.

   I  would have sat on the lawn with my
   children and not worried
   about grass stains.

   I would have cried and laughed  less
   while watching television and
   more while watching  life.

   I would have gone to bed when I was
   sick instead  of pretending the
   earth would go into a holding
   pattern if I  weren't there for the
   day.

   I would never have bought  anything
   just because it was practical,
   wouldn't show soil or  was guaranteed
   to last a lifetime.

   Instead of wishing  away nine months
   of pregnancy, I'd have
   cherished every moment  realizing
   that the wonderment growing inside
   me was the only  chance in life to
   assist God in a miracle.

   When my  kids kissed me impetuously,
   I would never have said,
   ""Later.  Now go get washed up for
   dinner.""

   There would have  been more ""I love
   you's""

   .....but mostly, given  another shot at life, I would seize every
   minute.....look at it and  really see it ... live it ... and never
give
   it back.

   In honor of women's history month and in memory of Erma Bombeck who
   lost her fight with cancer.

   Here is an angel sent to  watch over you

    ** (\*** /) *. *
    ** (\(_)/ ) *
    ** (_/ \_) . *
    * * /___\ *. *

   Pass this on  to five women that you want watched over. If you
don't    know five women  to pass this on to, one will do just  fine

Thanks:   Norma

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib.

Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad.

"RE: Denver Travel Profiles/Arrangers","Zou,

Hello, I hope you had a good flight back to Texas.  Thank you very much for your visit to the Denver location - I found it very informative.  

I faxed over travel profiles to your office for the Enron North America, Denver employees.  I am now requesting the right to make travel using ""ClickTrip"" on behalf of the employees in our office:  Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, Theresa Staab, and Tyrell Harrison.  Please set me, Heidi DuBose, up as their travel arranger.

Thank you again for the meeting,

Sincerely,

Subject: Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity


Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban

Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson!  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=12342&>, WR TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football215.fan! ta! sy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=12753&>, RB! J! AC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football215! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10! /! 23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free ! Ag! ent Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

David Terrell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Really Rottens Updated 10/23/01
Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular se! as! on game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=12405&>, WR TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in! W! eek Seven.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1265&>, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coac! h ! Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.

Brett Favre <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1028&>, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""

James Stewart <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1958&key=1116&>, RB DE! T! - Orange Roughy Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.

 The following was written by Andy Rooney, a man who has the gift of saying so 
     much with so few words. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly 
     person. 

     I've learned.... 
     That when you're in love, it shows. 

     I've learned.... 
     That just one person saying to me, ""You've made my day!"" makes my 
     day. 

     I've learned.... 
     That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most 
     peaceful feelings in the world. 

     I've learned.... 
     That being kind is more important than being right. 

     I've learned.... 
     That you should never say no to a gift from a child. 

     I've learned.... 
     That I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength 
     to 
     help him in some other way. 

     I've learned.... 
     That no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone 
     needs a friend to act goofy with. 

     I've learned.... 
     That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to 
     understand. 

     I've learned.... 
     That simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights 
     when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult. 

     I've learned.... 
     That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the 
     end, the faster it goes. 

     I've learned.... 
     That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for. 

     I've learned.... 
     That money doesn't buy class. 

     I've learned.... 
     That it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.
 
     I've learned... 
     That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be 
     appreciated and loved. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think I 
     can? 

     I've learned.... 
     That to ignore the facts does not change the facts. 

     I've learned.... 
     That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting 
     that person continue to hurt you. 

     I've learned.... 
     That love, not time, heals all wounds. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround 
     myself with people smarter than I am. 

     I've learned.... 
     That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile. 

     I've learned.... 
     That there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and 
     feeling their breath on your cheeks. 

     I've learned.... 
     That no one is perfect until you fall in love with them. 

     I've learned.... 
     That life is tough, but I'm tougher. 

     I've learned.... 
     That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you 
     miss. 

     I've learned.... 
     That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere. 

     I've learned.... 
     That I wish I could have told my Dad that I love him one more time 
     before he passed away. 

     I've learned.... 
     That one should keep his words both soft and tender, because 
     tomorrow he may have to eat them. 

     I've learned.... 
     That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks. 

     I've learned.... 
     That I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.
 
     I've learned.... 
     That when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his 
     little fist, that you're hooked for life. 

     I've learned.... 
     That everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the 
     happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it. 

     I've learned ... 
     That it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is 
     requested and when it is a life threatening situation. 

     I've learned.... 
     That the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done. 

     To all of you.... Make sure you read all the way down to the last 
     sentence. 

     It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care. 
     Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means 
     sending it back to the person who sent it to you. If it comes back 
     to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends. HAPPY 
     FRIENDSHIP WEEK TO YOU!!!!!! YOU ARE MY FRIEND AND I AM 
     HONORED! 
     Now send this to every friend you have!! And to your family. This 
     was sent to me.

Subject: Unify Gas Team Status Report
 
I just wanted to give everyone a quick update on what the Unify team is working on these days.  Here's a quick summary of where we're focusing our time (above and beyond production support activities):
 
Performance Tuning - We are continuing our efforts to optimize stored procedures.  During the month of November we collected a great deal of metrics on stored procedure resource consumption.  That data has been analyzed and as a result we have a list of roughly 25 stored procedures that may require attention (some of them may already be as efficient as possible).  I've attached a spreadsheet which summarizes our efforts.  The spreadsheet contains mostly technical information, but if you take a look at the ""Area"" column you will see which areas are impacted by these procedures.
NewCo Project Planning - We have spent a great deal of time developing hardware and software inventories in support of the ongoing NewCo discussions.  We're also beginning detailed planning around reconfiguring hardware, modifying applications as necessary, testing, etc. that will be required should we go forward with a new trading entity.
Security Refresh - In light of recent layoffs and in anticipation of forming a new entity, we are doing a complete refresh of our system security components.  This includes disabling old accounts, resetting all server passwords, resetting master application passwords, etc.
Application Runbooks - We have a tremendous amount of documentation on the Unify system.  However, we have never put together complete runbooks.  Runbooks are designed to document all application components, communicate operational procedures, specify instructions for building the Unify application and migrating components to production, etc.  This information will be critical in the event we move forward with NewCo.
EDI Rewrite - We are still actively working on this project (albeit more slowly than a month ago).  Matt's team is delivering a demo of scheduled quantities in early January.  We're reluctant to provide revised target dates due to our expectation that NewCo planning will delay things, but at this point we think a February delivery timeframe is likely.
Projects On Hold - The following projects have been put on hold due to resource constraints:
Booking Statement   
Database Split

The formula BP is using is highlighted in red below. After I inquired about the discrepancy, my counterpart at BP emailed her trader who talked to Paul Lucci. Apparently, BP is using the correct pricing. I just faxed copies of the invoices to you.

Thanks,

Just spoke with Paul Lucci at Enron.  He agrees that they are not showing
the correct equation.  Mine is correct.  His accountant will get back into
the office tomorrow to make corrections.  Let me know if you do not hear
from them in the next couple of days.

	Janice-

	Good morning.  I have a price discrepancy for deal 120644/120643,
Anschutz Plant, for 8/01 and 9/01 (and if it is not corrected, we could have
a discrepancy for as long as the deal lasts, until 4/02).  Enron is showing
the rate to be Inside FERC NWPL Rockies + $0.02 less $0.09 (Mcf conversion).
In ET Deal our formula is (NWPL Rocky Mountains IF) + .02 - ((1.022-.995) *
(Kern Wyoming IF)).

	Can you please verify who is correct, and if Enron's rate is
correct, can you please make the changes for 8/01, 9/01 and the continuing
months in the deal?  If we are correct, can you please talk to your
counterpart at Enron to see about getting this resolved this month?  My
counterpart and I would both like to have this rate discrepancy cleared this
month.

	Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank
you for all your help.

"CAEM Predictions 2002","Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets

Wow!  What a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition.
For every good bit of news (Pat Wood, one of our heroes at CAEM, being
selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the
continuing progress that the Canadians - yes, the Canadians - have made
towards energy competition), we have had to bear one disaster and misstep
after another throughout the year.   Let's see, in December 2000, who could
have predicted..

1.  The tragic events of September 11th.
2.  The California implosion.
3.  Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment.
4.  Price volatility and high prices (but it could have been worse if Mother
Nature did not help out).
5.  Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring.
6.  Enron collapse.
7.  FERC Blinks on Super RTO.
8.  Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market.
9.  No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring.

2001 was one heck of a year - but thankfully, probably the nadir of the
movement towards energy competition in North America.  As CAEM looks into
our crystal ball (natural gas fired, of course) for the coming year, we see
a better year.  Below are some of the predictions and responses from the
CAEM staff about what we expect to occur.  The responses below are primarily
concerned with electricity, but to a lesser extent, may be applied to
natural gas as well.

As always, do not bet the house on what we have to say.  We are just a
little think tank, kind of like the little engine that could.  And we can.
And we do.

Happy New Year!

The CAEM Staff

P.S. If you would like to add a prediction or two, please send an e-mail
with your name and contact information to Hope Duncan at hduncan@caem.org
We will post them to our web site - www.caem.org  Please identify which
question below is being addressed by your prediction.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

"RE: Path Manager Rewrite / Optimization project","Following are my comments.  The managers cc'd might have some additional thoughts.

Subject:	Path Manager Rewrite / Optimization project
Importance:	High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

The sooner we get someone to devote to this, the better off we will be.  I expect these changes that we'll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit.  

That being said, we've identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of Path Manager.  

1)  Currently, the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids.  I can't think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step?    It runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn't find a match.  I know Patti has mentioned this several times and I can't think of a valid reason for performing this work.  I talked with Dave Nommensen, and according to him, what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place???  From a scheduling perspective, my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it.  If you were overpathed, you'd see it in the Path Manager either way. [Pinion, Richard]    To restate the question for clarity, in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply, market and a service, adds any up/downstream contract information and/or Duns or DRN override and then saves it.  Unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re-uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id.  I had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted.  Has this changed???  At one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations.  Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used.  I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs this to occur.  Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected.  Therefore, if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify, I don't think that this constant old path look up is needed.  

2)  The scheduling position window:  does anyone use this?  If not, we'll remove the code logic that populates this window.  I have never seen a scheduler use this.  Please verify. [Pinion, Richard]   Originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system ""Autonoms"" so it was duplicated in Unify by request.  It is not used in Unify now because of the other sophisticated tools Unify provides which obviate it's use.  The only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems.  As voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - Lose it! 

3)  On the inventory pool list, does anyone need to see the Contarct References List?  Again, this code is called every retrieval time and doesn't appear to be used from my observations.   If they do need this information, we could provide it, but if not, I'd prefer to remove the functionality. [Pinion, Richard]    This function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool.  Keep it! 

4)  When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths, what's the average number of paths they create at one time?  What about updates?  I know that ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to.  Does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records?  My real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and Inserts.  By update, I mean, going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be created. [Pinion, Richard]    This one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline.  There is no 'average'.  They typically update a path with up/downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however.  I hope this answers your question.  I see no change to this process at this time 

5)  On brokered paths, do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Service?  In other words, when updating Brokered arrangements, we don't incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated?  Why do we do this for service?  Is it because we have to renominate it?  I assume that's what it's for since we don't send brokered paths to the pipe.  Anyway, with the Nomlogic implmentation (two way interface), we were planning on having it behave the same way as service.  We need this verified. [Pinion, Richard]    We don't perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path.  I don't see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time.

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the ! st! retch.

Trent Dilfer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for ! Ha! sselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=get! ba! d&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick ! Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they wil! l ! activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards o! n ! 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football209.fantasy.sportsli! ne! .com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football209! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3855&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

"Denver Deals","Paul,

Could you set aside some time today to talk to me about the recent Kennedy Oil deal in addition to 2 other deals.  These other deals were discovered in our bid week preparations, and are causing our desk some pretty big negative Prior Month Adjustments.  So, we need to get these resolved.  The first one is the Williams / wic deal. The deal #'s for that are 121890,854562, & 1068893.  The reason for the split of this deal is b/c our books changed names.  The second deal in question which needs to be resolved a.s.a.p. is a Red Rock Energy LLC deal #133661.  This deal is being booked to Denver in Sitara, but in Tagg the risk is going to Keith Holst and Mike Grigsby.  

Please look over these deals and let me know when a good time to talk will be.  Thank you!

"FW: That's Mighty Funny!","

 

A very dedicated Teamsters Union worker was attending a convention in Las 
Vegas and, as you would expect, decided to check out the local brothels 
nearby.  
When he got to the first one, he asked the Madam, 
""Is this a union house?"" 
""No,"" she replied, ""I'm sorry, it isn't."" 
""Well, if I pay you $100.00, what cut do the girls get?"" 
""The house gets $80.00 and the girls get $20.00.""  
Mightily offended at such unfair dealings, the man stomped off down the 
street in search of a more equitable, hopefully unionized shop. His search 
continued until finally he reached a brothel where the Madam responded, ""Why  
yes sir, this IS a Union House.""  
The man asked, ""And if I pay you $100.00, what cut do the girls get?"" ""The 
girls get $80.00 and the house gets $20.00.""  
""That's more like it!"" the Teamster said. He handed the Madam $100.00, 
looked around the room and pointed to a stunningly attractive blonde. ""I'd 
like her for the night.""  
""I'm sure you would, sir,"" said the Madam, then gesturing to an 85 year old 
woman in the corner, ""but Ethel here has seniority.....""
