Geoff:  I understand that I need to get with you to approve the portion of my budget that is allocated the Enron America's.  Currently  $  299,871 is budgeted for allocation to EA.  My group coordinates JV activities as well as conducting due diligence on IT areas related to aquisitions and divestitures.  The amount budgeted above is for the following known projects:

		Coordination and Operations under the Bridgeline IT Services Agreement
		Due Diligence related to Project Sugarcane and how we may monetize our investment in Bridgeline

In 2002 ENA will bill Bridgeline $1,250,000 for IT Services.  Since Chevron/Texaco covers 60% of the bill ENA will net $750,000 in revenue for the services coordinated by my group.  

Let me know if you'd like to get together and discuss this in any detail.

Zhiyong -

I have looked over the consolidated gas system inception document.  Here are a few questions/observations:

1.  Value all physical deals.  Not just current month.  This will require logistics to enter all forward transport rather than just current month.  (This is not an issue,  just needs to be addressed as we go)

2.  Term transport in new physical system would require spread option model to be in place.  

3.  Storey -  Would all term transportation be a spread option and we would set the correlations to one if there was no optionality?

4.  CPR is currently used as a back up if Sitara goes down.  What would we do if the new system goes down?

5.  What is the functionality to downstream systems going to look like?  (Risktrac - V@R, credit)

6.  Will calculations be performed from the same new system as Global Markets?

7.  What will happen if:  There is a fixed price physical deal where the risk components are split? 

Example: Price : NG-PRICE		Basis: FT-WEST		Index: INTRA-WEST

"Re: How's everything going?","All is well. Vicki left the hospital the first week in Feb. She's been in bed at home since. 
We're now at 31 weeks and the doctor said she wants to induce around 36/37 weeks. 
So we may only have 5 weeks left !!! 

We got all excited this weekend cause we bought a car seat and stroller. 
I push the stroller around the house with a teddy bear in it, pretending to be a daddy.

Chow,

Geoff, if we are given a 2/1 effective date with UBS your benefits with Enron will be active through 1/31/02. 
UBS like Enron does use Hewitt as their 401K Vendor, however they do not have the self-directed account feature set up.
In regards to a provider list for doctors, UBS uses Cigna as their network provider.  You can go out to the web at Cigna's home page and pull up a list of providers by entering in you home address/zip code at the following link.

http://www.cigna.com/general/misc/docdir.html

attached below is a copy of their benefits at a glance document if you have not already seen it.

Tony,
Geoff is an employee slated to go to NETCO.  Can you answer the questions from his wife below.  They have a particular need for medical coverage so any info you could supply would be helpful.

I believe we will be covered on Enron Benefits through the end of Jan and will be on UBS as of Feb 1.  The enrollment period would begin sometime after the hire date so maybe last week Jan./first week Feb.

The 401k will be self-direct won't it?

Don't know about the list of doctors?

Good morning, everyone.

Just wanted to let you know that we finally have some of our proofs 
available on-line.  It isn't our whole book, but it is a fair sample.  I 
think they got most of the pictures of you guys posted if you are interested 
in buying a print.  I believe you can order directly from the page.

If anyone wants to see more, call Andrea or myself and we can help you out.

Steps for accessing the proofs are:

1.  Point your browser to ""www.elanphotography.com""
2.  From the home page, select ""Weddings""
3.  From the Weddings page, select ""On-line Ordering"".  This will open a new 
browser window to a list of weddings shot by our photographer.
4.  Select the ""Childers/Luebbering"" wedding.
5.  This will prompt you to enter a username and password.
       Enter:
          username: childers
          password: gnirebbeul
6.  Browse at will.  I believe there are three or four pages of proofs.  If 
you drill down on a picture, you can order it there.

Let me know if you have any problems accessing this site.

Later,

Jason

Geoff,

The Canada Physical Basis spread product types are ready to have products built within them.  If you let me know which locations you would like to offer the spread on, I will build them and let you take a look at the functionality.

Tony hasn't returned from Vegas yet.  As of Friday, he thought that he could still get some harper gas. 

 Sorry for the delay.  I don't really understand why takes so long, but I suspect it's the people TC deals with.  He is pretty diligent, but they don't always give him a straight answer

It looks like we are going to release most of NBPL capacity that we have (55,000 of the 100,000).  Mirant & BP want the Haper to Chicago capacity for $.08 and Dynergy wants Vent to Chicago for $.12.  PGL wants to exchange their manhattan to North Hayden for the remaining Vent to harper, so there may an opportunity to have PGL buy Vent and sell you Harper, but dealing with PGL is even slower that dealing with Tony.

I'll talk to Tony as soon as I see him

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Subject: Disclaiming Insurance



Connie,

I think we finally decided how much money we want to disclaim for purposes of funding the trust. 

We will not be diclaiming the house but will try to disclaim two life insurance checks, an ADD through Jimmy's employer, Marsh & McLennan, and held with CNA and the credit card Travel Accidental Death Insurace held through American Express. I will be talking to the Larry Harman about the process of doing this. It will add about 450k to the estate and take the probate assets up to about 1.4M or 700k for the trust.
[Connie L. Babbitt]  That sounds good.  There are always complications when a personal residence is put in a disclaimer trust, so I believe you are making the correct decision there.  

Is there any deadline or timelines on when the trust must be setup? 
[Connie L. Babbitt]  No, but the disclaimer must be filed with the probate court by June 11, 2002. 

Is there a form to send to the IRS to request a tax ID for the trust?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  Yes, an SS-4 Form.  We can prepare one for your mother's signature. 

My mom wants to know if we need to meet with you or when?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  I would like to meet with her.  I think she will be more comfortable if she's had a chance to meet me personally, although it's certainly not required.  I visit many of my clients at their home, so I could meet at her house if that would be more convenient for her.  She may prefer a meeting fairly soon to answer any general questions she may have about the estate, trust funding, and distributions of assets.  If our firm will be preparing the 2001 income tax return, I would also need to meet with her to obtain all the 1099s, W-2s, etc for the 2001 return.  A meeting around the end of January, beginning of February would probably be good timing for that.

When will we find out what those new regulations will really mean for our estate income taxes?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  Once I see the 2001 1099s, W-2s, etc and get a better grip on all the income sources, we ought to be able to zero in better on the issues.  At first blush, I would anticipate very little tax liability for 2001.  I'm hoping the IRS will be issuing further guidance to address more details, e.g. spousal income, etc, over the next few weeks.  I'm sorry I can't give you a more definitive answer on this one.

Thanks,

 

Geof

All,
I've recently learned that I'm not receiving a lot of emails  sent to this address, and AT&T can't seem to solve the problem.  I  apologize if you've sent something to me and I've not replied.  I'm going  to phase this out over the next couple of weeks.  
 
Therefore, please update your address books to the  following:
 jmiles777@yahoo.com 
 
Thanks,
Jason

David,

Thanks for your patience. We are working hard on getting Coral and BP North America on board with the ring trades.

I have another counterparty that may want to ring out some ATM Chicago basis. Let me know about that.

I have also enclosed the language that would tie all these trades together.

Thanks,

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Those idiots. I was in a hurry and didn't want to miss my flight, so i walked out and assumed that they would just bill the credit card.

But before I left I gave the tux to the front desk and gave them your name and room number. The guy was like, ""Okay"" and then walked to the back room without writting your name or anything down. So i told him again what name and room number. He said ""no problem"".

Oh well. Sorry about the trouble and thanks for the invite. It was a great wedding.

Subject:	Management Changes

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

I know that you are busy, so I will send you an e-mail instead of trying to
reach you by phone...

Just a few quick questions for you:

1.   Box 13, Code ""C"" for $36.00 on your W-2 - is this your donation to the
United Way?

2.  Please confirm that you donated $533 to the German Shephard Dog Rescue
and paid $533 at closing for real estate taxes.  I just want to make sure
that it is a coincidence that these amounts are the same, and not a typing
error.

3.  Please confirm that you paid $3,133.88 for your Tibco International
Inc. shares and sold at $2,905.09, and paid $9,355.00 for your Nasdaq
shares and sold at $7,459.75 (both sold at a loss).


Thank you kindly,

Hi Geoff,

We have prepared an estimate of your taxes owing in the US April 16th given
the information you have provided to us and recommend that you make a
$20,000 payment to the IRS on or before that date.

I will fax an extension form to you along with instructions as to where you
should file it.  The extension, if filed timely, gives us until August 15th
to submit your tax return to the IRS but we would like to have it completed
by April 30th, the Canadian filing deadline, as we are also filing a
Canadian tax return for you (I believe we discussed this previously).
Please confirm that your fax number is 713-646-3390 and if you have any
special instructions before I send the fax.

Thanks and kind regards,

Subject: Disclaiming Insurance



Connie,

I think we finally decided how much money we want to disclaim for purposes of funding the trust. 

We will not be diclaiming the house but will try to disclaim two life insurance checks, an ADD through Jimmy's employer, Marsh & McLennan, and held with CNA and the credit card Travel Accidental Death Insurace held through American Express. I will be talking to the Larry Harman about the process of doing this. It will add about 450k to the estate and take the probate assets up to about 1.4M or 700k for the trust.
[Connie L. Babbitt]  That sounds good.  There are always complications when a personal residence is put in a disclaimer trust, so I believe you are making the correct decision there.  

Is there any deadline or timelines on when the trust must be setup? 
[Connie L. Babbitt]  No, but the disclaimer must be filed with the probate court by June 11, 2002. 

Is there a form to send to the IRS to request a tax ID for the trust?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  Yes, an SS-4 Form.  We can prepare one for your mother's signature. 

My mom wants to know if we need to meet with you or when?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  I would like to meet with her.  I think she will be more comfortable if she's had a chance to meet me personally, although it's certainly not required.  I visit many of my clients at their home, so I could meet at her house if that would be more convenient for her.  She may prefer a meeting fairly soon to answer any general questions she may have about the estate, trust funding, and distributions of assets.  If our firm will be preparing the 2001 income tax return, I would also need to meet with her to obtain all the 1099s, W-2s, etc for the 2001 return.  A meeting around the end of January, beginning of February would probably be good timing for that.

When will we find out what those new regulations will really mean for our estate income taxes?
[Connie L. Babbitt]  Once I see the 2001 1099s, W-2s, etc and get a better grip on all the income sources, we ought to be able to zero in better on the issues.  At first blush, I would anticipate very little tax liability for 2001.  I'm hoping the IRS will be issuing further guidance to address more details, e.g. spousal income, etc, over the next few weeks.  I'm sorry I can't give you a more definitive answer on this one.

Thanks,

 

Geof

Subject:	Message from Ken Lay

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Mary Jo:
Per our conversation below, could you take a quick look at the data below and see if Varn International is a company we can work with?

Thanks.


Believe it or not, I am currently working in the Northwest side of Houston  
with Varn International.  Our parent company, Day International,  has  
facilities located in Michigan and North Carolina.   Would you be so kind and  
point me in the right direction as to who might handle the Carolina Power and  
Light account in Ashville, NC as well as the American Electric Power account  
in Three Rivers Michigan.  Our Day plants have been using brokers but I  
thought we might could work with Enron, if they are in that market area, and  
possibly negotiate some long term agreement for all our facilities.  Once  
they found out I had natural gas experience, they put me on this project.   
Otherwise I'm responsible for purchasing and logistics for North America and  
eventually worldwide.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Williams buys from Bank of America    500 contracts/month Jan02-Dec02 ATM + $1

ENA sells to Bank of America             250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1
ENA buys from Williams                     250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1
Williams buys from Bank of America    250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1
 
Either set of trades takes off $60million of exposure and flattens our total nymex swap positions. The latter fits the term structure of our positions better, but the former may fit our credit positions better.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""
