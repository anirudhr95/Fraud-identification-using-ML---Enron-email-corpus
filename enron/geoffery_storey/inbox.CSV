"Logistics Commercial Realignment","

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"New Meters  and products on PGLC","
The basic reason we are changing meters in Sitara is because when PGLC was originally set up, the meters were set up using the same name as what the pipeline called them, i.e. NGPL/909265. This is the NGPL meter number NOT the PGLC meter number.  The PGLC Meter number is PGLC/NGPL.  The only reason we are doing this is so we can have everything correctly reflected so we can upload noms into pegasys with the meter number PGLC specifically used. 

The 3 products that will be in place for November at PGLC are:

NBPL/Manhattan - this is where we are buying Northern Border Specific Gas to take to PGLC at the NBPL/Peoples/82 (Manhattan transfer point).  We will then have a meter bounce ticket to take it from NBPL/PGLC/82 to PGLC/NBPL/NB01 and take it into our pool.

NGPL/Peoples - this is where we are buying NGPL specific gas to take to PGLC at the NGPL/Peoples/909285 Meter.  We will then have a meter bounce ticket to take it from NGPL/Peoples/909285 to PGLC/NGPL/NGPL and take it into our pool.

CHI Peoples - this is where we are buying pool gas at PGLC at the TTP pool. - this is the product that has been out there but all deals will be mapped to the TTP point. THis is where the majority of customers give us our gas.


The only time we will be using the meter PGLC/NGPL/NGPL, PGLC/NBPL/NB01, PGLC/ANR/ANR,  and other PGLC/pipeline specific meters is when gas is actually being delivered on a contract into the gate.  For the most part all of our gas will be at meter PGLC/TTP/TTP.


Thanks!!

Cora

Subject:	WTC Disaster - Transition to Family Relationship 
Management

This important message will appear in the upcoming Operations Update.

MMC is committed to assisting the families of our colleagues through 
this most difficult time.  We want to make sure that they are aware of 
all the programs and services the Company is providing and that they 
fully understand the benefits to which they are entitled, as well as 
other benefits that may be available through outside agencies.  In 
reviewing the most effective way to continue serving the families 
affected by the September 11th disaster, we have made the decision to 
move to a family relationship management approach.  Our priority in 
moving forward is to ensure that we provide the families with the best 
one-on-one assistance and the best information possible.

Family Relationship Management
To that end, we have engaged Right Management Associates (Right) to 
work with us as our Family Relationship Managers.  Reginald McQuay, a 
Marsh Senior Vice President, will manage this program as the main 
interface between Marsh and Right,s counselors to guide this important 
process.  All of the Family Relationship Managers have substantial 
experience in Human Resources, and we feel they will represent us well 
as we help the families move forward.  Additionally, Right has worked 
with Marsh over the last several years and, therefore, knows our 
organization well.

We are already moving quickly to transition to this process.  The 
Family Relationship Managers have participated in detailed orientation 
and training sessions, acquainting themselves with MMC,s benefits, 
legal, communication and policy issues.  Each of the families will be 
contacted within the next week by the Family Relationship Managers  
representing Marsh; in this way the transition will be as transparent 
as possible to the families.  In addition, a letter will be sent to 
each family's primary contact this week, providing them with the name 
and phone number of their Relationship Manager.

One important point that you need to be aware of concerns the &primary 
contact8 for each family.  We have been working with the MMC Benefits 
and Legal Departments to determine whom the appropriate family contact 
for all matters should be as we move forward.  Please keep in mind that 
this individual may not always be the person with whom you have had 
contact.  We are trying to ensure that the detailed financial and 
benefit information is only provided to the family members who should 
have it. 

Additional Counseling
We will also be offering Survivor Support Financial Counseling to the 
primary contact through the Ayco Company.  Ayco counselors will provide 
detailed information on survivor benefits and will also be arranging to 
meet personally with each of the families.  This will follow issuance 
of the benefit summary statement, which is scheduled to be distributed 
during the week of October 15.  Ayco counselors will be coordinating 
their efforts with the Family Relationship Managers as well.

In addition, we have expanded the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for 
one year for the families.  This will provide access to counselors who 
are skilled in grief and trauma situations.

Your Role As A Manager
We recognize that in many instances Marsh managers have had long 
relationships with the various families.  Although it is important to 
maintain those contacts and continue to provide emotional support, it 
is equally important that you begin to transfer the responsibility for 
information dissemination and management to the Family Relationship 
Managers.  To this end, we are asking that you allow the Family 
Relationship Managers to facilitate the contact with all Marsh services 
and that you do not provide direct referrals to services, promise any 
additional services or become the intermediary in resolving the 
families, issues. 

Please keep us informed of your contact with any of the families since 
this information can be  helpful to Family Relationship Managers.  To 
help facilitate this, we have attached a call log to capture important 
information from both past conversations and any particulars that may 
arise in the future.  Please forward these logs to Reg McQuay at 1166 
Ave. of the Americas, 43rd floor (reginald.a.mcquay@marsh.com). 

This Family Relationship Management Program will provide the best 
possible support for our colleagues, families as they move forward 
during this difficult time.  If you have any further questions please 
call me or your HR manager, and help us by distributing this memo to 
other managers who need to know this information.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sally Bott

"ENA Gas Budget Sign Off","Mark,

Zhiyong and I met with Geoff this evening, to run over the budget numbers.

Geoff was prepared to give the OK to the following items

CGS Physical			$ 2,065,308
Sitara/CPR/TDS Maint		$ 1,310,853
TAGG/ERMS Maint		$ 1,273,775
CGS Financial			$ 1,451,316
Gas Performance Upgrades	$   800,000
TOTAL				$  6,901252

Of the the other items in that section, the IT Commerical Co-ordination piece needs to be handled by Tommy Yanowski, the Global Valuation Mtce piece shouldn't be there and has now been corrected in the underlying sheets, and the Gas Fundamentals piece needs to move to Chris Gaskill's pot.

Zhiyong and I will meet with Chris Gaskill first thing in the morning to get sign off on the numbers for Gas Fundamentals. We don't anticipate a problem with this as Geoff Storey has already given him a heads-up on the costs. We have also cut around $700k off the Gas Fundamentals costs which didn't make it to the final printout today in the meeting.

regards

Steve

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Russell, 
I agree with all of Jeff's comments on both the GPA and the PMA.  I primarily have questions about the GPA, because I do not understand the Kalkaska issue they are trying to address.  It seems that they are wanting to limit us, while at the same time not limit us.  As for the PMA, the problems that Jeff notes are problematic.  Please let me know when we can meet to discuss and please give me the courtesy of seeing the next draft before it goes to MGU.

I'm really sorry to hear about your father.  I hope that everything is
getting better now after all that terrible thing.  I'll pray for him too.

I'm glad to hear that you already have a daughter.  My youngest son is
slightly older than your daughter.  He is eight-month old.

I'm still doing commodity trading like before, rice, tapioca and yellow
maize.  Now we are also investing on Corn Oil project.

Well, just keep in touch Geoff,  write to me when you have time.

- IT Floor floats monthly between 80-120% of FT depending on AECO MI and seasonal marginal fuel rate (at current prices expected to remain at 80%)
- NEB expected to review Settlement Guidelines in near future (potentially opening door in future to FERC style negotiated tolls)

"FW: My deepest sympathy","Geoff  - While I was reading the newspaper on Sunday, I saw the article about your father.  I was so shocked to learn of your loss.  You and your family are in our prayers.  After I lost my father, I went through a very difficult period.  But my faith and my family certainly did help me get through that time in my life more than 5 years ago.
 
Again, my deepest sympathy to you and your family.  You are definitely in my thoughts and prayers.

I am sending three confirms for you to view, however, the comments on these deals are switchable rights / we can point transport to secondary delivery.  I am unclear what you are trying to do, please pick one of the selections below to go in the confirms that stats what you are trying to say.  Also, what is the secondary delivery point.

1.  Buyer has the option to take gas at either Delivery Point upon proper notice to Seller prior to the pipeline nomination deadline for any Period of Delivery.

2.  Prior to the pipeline nomination deadline, either party may select a secondary Delivery Point from among (list point(s)) or any other mutually agreeable point.
	
	3.  Buyer, at its option and upon proper notice to Seller prior to the pipeline nomination deadline, shall have the 	right to change Delivery Points up to ??? times during the Period of Delivery

   
Thanks

"Sithe TCPL transport","I'm in Houston this week and am available Thursday morning.  I would appreciate the opportunity to get together to discuss the intentions for disposition of the Sithe TCPL position.  I had figured that Geoff would value the pipe, take it in at a discounted position (paid for by Sithe with project equity), and then we would try to market it away at a higher value.  However, I have heard all kinds of different scenarios from within the company and would like to clarify this.
Please let me know if I can catch some time with you Thursday (June 7th) morning to review this.  Thanks.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"IUAA e-Newsletter #13 (526139)","Volume 2, Number 1
Nov. 27, 2001

Welcome to the first issue of the second year of the IU Alumni Association
e-Newsletter, which is sent monthly to IU alumni for whom we have e-mail
addresses. The e-Newsletter connects you to IU with information on alumni
happenings, special deals, new features, and more. You can unsubscribe or

1. IU News Roundup
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* IU's overall retention rate is up nearly 1 percent. The retention rate is
the percentage of first-year students who come back for their second year of
study. On IU's eight campuses, 69.8 percent of first-year students in 2000
returned for the 2001 fall semester. That compares to 69 percent of the 1999
class returning in 2000. On the individual campuses, retention was up at
IUPUI, IPFW, IU Northwest, and IU South Bend. It declined at IU Bloomington,
IU East, IU Kokomo, and IU Southeast. The full retention report is available
at http://www.indiana.edu/~rrlilly/

* IU's Business Outlook Panel toured the state in November, including stops
at various IU campuses. The business experts said the country is in a
recession, but they expect the economic situation to begin a slow recovery in
the spring after a slow holiday shopping season. See
http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/ocm/releases/forecast02.htm

* The holiday weekend was a big one for IU sports. With a 13-7 victory over
Purdue in the rain on Nov. 24, IU won the Old Oaken Bucket for the first time
since 1996. IU's soccer Hoosiers advanced to the third round of the NCAA
tournament with a 1-0 victory over Michigan State on Nov. 25. And the men's
basketball team won two of three games in the Great Alaska Shootout. For
details, see the IU athletics Web site at http://www.iuhoosiers.com

* The 11th annual IU Dance Marathon in October raised $405,412.17 for Riley
Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. A total of 550 participants danced
during 36 hours for the project. Over the 11 years of the Dance Marathon, IU
students have raised more than $2 million. For more details, see
http://www.indiana.edu/~iudmc/home.html

2. Theatre/Neal-Marshall Dedication
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, noted authors, actors, and activists, will be the
keynote speakers at the dedication of the new building that will house the
Theatre and Drama Center and the Marcellus Neal and Frances Marshall Black
Culture Center at IUB. The dedication is scheduled for 2 p.m. on Friday, Jan.
18, in the Ruth N. Halls Theatre in the new facility. Later in the day, the
public is invited to a free presentation of ""An Evening with Ossie Davis and
Ruby Dee"" at 7:30 p.m. at the IU Auditorium. For further details, see
http://www.indiana.edu/~nealmar and

3. Holiday Gifts
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Look for the perfect holiday stocking stuffer at the IU Alumni Association's
online gift store. This year the Alumni Collection features great gift ideas
priced under $25. For gift ideas perfect for all Hoosier boosters, visit
http://www.alumni.indiana.edu/merch.html
Or consider giving a membership in the IU Alumni Association. Members receive
a subscription to the INDIANA ALUMNI MAGAZINE, a lifetime IU alumni e-mail
forwarding address, access to the online alumni directory, special discounts,
and much more. See https://www.indiana.edu/~alumni/benefits/giftapp.shtml
Another possibility, just in time for the holiday season, is Little 500
merchandise. T-shirts, sweatshirts, jerseys, posters, and more make great
gifts for IU alumni. All proceeds directly benefit working-student
scholarships at IU. See http://iusf.bloomington.com

4. Online Directory Available
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The IU Alumni Association's new online directory is up and running. The
service includes listings for living IU and PUI alumni, faculty, and staff,
IUAA members, and known former students who are in the alumni database. It is
the official Indiana University alumni directory and replaces the former
""Alumni Network."" To view your record or update your holiday card addresses,
go to the IUAA Web site at http://www.alumni.indiana.edu and click on the IU
Alumni Online Directory option.

5. HHE Visit to Statehouse

Statehouse. The program will be Feb. 20, at the Radisson Hotel City Centre,

grants at the group's annual scholarship luncheon on Nov. 2. Each recipient
received $2,000. The club is comprised of IU alumni who have received the
DASA award over the years. The $60,000 covering the total award amount comes

1956, a total of 625 awards have been made totaling more than $600,000.

Association Scholars, these students, who must be children of IUAA members,
will be chosen on the basis of financial need and academic achievement.

must send a non-refundable registration payment to Knowledge Beginnings.
You will have 15 calendar days to pay the enrollment fee of either $75 per

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Access Card Information","
Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Subject:	Basis Options

Goss,
I am out next week so I thought I would give you an update on Basis options reports.  Francis sent me the first 3 today.  They were absolute crap the numbers weren't even close.  I met with him and another guy and we went over the reports and I told them how to arrive at the numbers.  I also gave them my report with numbers for them to tie out to.
Errol has the numbers to get in touch with me if you need anything.

*************************************************************************************************************************************************

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"flexible deal view data archiving","Jeff,

	I spoke with Jay briefly about the potential of archiving all physical deals every night into a separate database instead
of deleting them.  We currently are capturing that information in our database, but the feed Jay has is more extensive and reliable.
We'd then be able to build some historical queries and facilitate some of the requests we have for this data, I don't anticipate it
would take much time to do this.

You have any objections?

Thanks,

Dave

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

"Prior Prices that are just wring","
  I'm looking at the GDP-HEHUB curve shift details, and it has a current price of 0, and prior price of 4.151 for August. Position manager's getting this from the deal aggregator, which grabs it from ERMS. It appears to be using the mid price off of deals. So if we look at post ID 1159936, deal Q29897.2, we have GDP-HEHUB for the pub code, and 4.151 as the mid price for August. My question for you fine gentlemen is, where should it be pulling the prior day curve value? Should I just hit egs_curves, and insert the value from there?

Randall, 

Bank of America is the proposed counterparty.

I wrote the exposure incorrectly on my last email. The trades are the
same, but your exposure to Enron is reduced and replaced with exposure
to Bank of America. 

Please let me know what you think.

"NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

"YOU HAVE 48 HOURS - Message from Louise Kitchen","

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.
