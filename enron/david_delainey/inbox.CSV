"On behalf of Joel Reed / Re: Assets in the Tammy Structure","Dave,
	Just a heads-up -  it sounds like the Tammy structure may get
highlighted to the Creditors Committee soon because of the expected sale
of the Indian E&P assets.
	I believe this will bring focus on the value of assets held in
Tammy.  To the extent that there are any assets within Tammy that you
believe may be candidates for the Newco you are considering, it would be
good to identify them early - before everyone starts focusing on how
much they might bring in liquidation.
	In addition to the Indian E&P assets, I am aware of the
following assets within the two Tammy structures:
			*	Option to acquire EREC (This option will
probably be rejected)
			*	A portion of the East Coast Power
investment (may be a note)
			*	Stock of EOG Resources (subject to a FAS
125 Transaction- no economic interest)
			*	Stock of LNG Power (Atlantic) Ltd. that
I am told includes Ecoelectrica
			*	Option to acquire Portland General Stock
	Other assets may be included.  Please contact me if you have any
questions.  I plan to be out this week, but will be checking voicemail
(858-704-3302).				

						Happy Holidays,

Kimberly, I was laid off on Monday and have not had my latest expense report electronically deposited into the credit union.  I was assured by management that I would be paid.  The amount is 642.10.  I would think that this is the least enron could do for me since I have only worked for EES for 2 months.  
 
Please ensure that my funds are deposited as soon as possible due to my current financial crisis.
 
Thank You,

We are working to gather as much information as possible on our exposure to relocated former and current domestic and international employees impacted by Enron's bankruptcy filing.  Lloyd has outlined our position on the urgent issues below. Please keep in mind that regardless of our obligation, the courts have only approved $15K per employee for all expenses less the $4500 payment if applicable.

We will continue to work on getting a comprehensive listing over the next couple of days.

Subject:	RE: EES Employee Issues


Daniel,

Per our conversation earlier, I am responding to some of your more urgent employee situations:

Faye Worthy -

Faye was one of the individuals who received a letter from All Relo-Services, Inc/Road Runner Moving & Storage regarding non payment of her moving bill.  A number of suppliers hand delivered invoices to Enron on Friday, November 30th.  When information was released on Sunday regarding Enron's filing for bankruptcy, many of the suppliers got extremely nervous. Faye Worthy's moving bill was for $9,293.69.  On Friday, December 7th., the moving company sent out demand letters to about 33 current and former Enron employees demanding immediate payment since Enron had not yet paid the moving bills.  We were advised that no payments could be made at this time.

Outstanding issues for Faye Worthy:

Unpaid household goods bill -	$9,293.69
Unpaid Temporary Living 	$8,400.00  ($4,500 per month - November & December unpaid)

It is my understanding that Faye Worthy was going to make the temporary living payments and Judy Gray was going to reimburse her.  The household goods bill remains unpaid.  We are awaiting instructions on how and when the outstanding invoices can be paid.


Stephen Borden

Outstanding issues:

Household goods were not delivered on 12/03/01 as scheduled.  The moving company (Xonex) decided not to release his shipment due to Enron's bankruptcy filing.  The amount of the household goods bill is $12,057.38.

New Home Closing Costs - Mr. Borden was scheduled to be reimbursed for his new home closing costs of $22,600.  Mr. Borden purchased his new home and closed on 11/30/01. He paid all of the closing costs.  When the relocation department received his reimbursement documentation, it was to late to process due to the bankruptcy filing.

Per George Wasaff and Judy Gray, they were scheduled to pay Mr. Borden $15,000 maximum including $4,500 severance for all relocation and business expenses.  Mr. Borden has $10,000 in business travel expenses that has not been reimbursed.

Recap:

Household Goods - not paid		$12,057.38
New Home Closing Costs 		$22,600.00 (Paid by Borden and not yet reimbursed)
Business Travel Expenses - 		$10,000 (Paid by Borden and not yet reimbursed)
Final Move Expenses - not paid		$235.00 


Stuart Rexrode -

Outstanding issues:

Mr. Rexrode has been contacted by Prudential household goods moving company.  At this point, his shipment has not yet taken place.

Kevin Greiner -

Air shipment has been received.  His ocean shipment is currently in storage with Transportation Worldwide, Inc., (Houston, TX) pending receipt of payment.  

Steven Peterson -

Since December 06, 01, shipment has been  held in storage by Transportation Worldwide, Inc. (Houston, TX).

As you can see from the emails below, EES leadership is extremely concerned about our exposure to both domestic and international relocations. I need to obtain the information on our folks by 11:00 a.m. today so that I can prepare and deliver a document to them.

Please let me know if this will be a problem.

Guys, can you please provide an update/status and plan to manage the following EES employee issues:

	a) Steve Borden - moving issues on sale of house and furniture;
	b) Faye Worthy - moving issues on furniture and apartment;
	c) Stuart Rexrode - moving issues on furniture, etc;
	d) Kevin Greiner - moving issues, etc;
	e) Steven Peterson - moving issues, etc;

Great job on Maureen.  Kalen are you aware of any other EES employee issues (such as what we spoke about on Friday) where I can help.  I believe Dan is looking at this as well.

Do we think it might be a good idea to have a meeting to discuss globally?

Subject:	Employee reinstatement

We have offered re-employment to Dierdre McCaffrey and she has accepted effective today. We need to reinstate her back to December 5, 2001. Robert Jones is handling all needed paperwork,etc. Dierdre was in EGM-Freights Markets prior to being terminated on 12/03/01. Prior to EGM, she spent numerous years in various positions in wholesale gas structuring, trading, and origination. She was instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and negotiating most of our gas asset management transactions. She worked with Laura Luce and team on the Peoples' Gas transactions, and she will be critical in ensuring we maintain and optimize these contracts and positions going forward. She will be working with Laura Luce in the Enron Estate. 

Thank you.

Subject:	EES contracts

I wanted to bring you up to speed about some meetings we have been having regarding contract issues in the bankruptcy proceedings.

In connection with our asset sales, EES has been concerned about the deterioration in the value of the EES book as we receive notices from customers that they are terminating their contracts with us.  In general, our customers would not have the right to terminate EES contracts unless the contracts are considered forward contracts.  If the contracts are non forward executory contracts, the customer would have no right to terminate, and only EES as the debtor could effectively terminate by rejecting the contract.  

In any event, EES had been planning to write to the utilities where we had customer books that we are trying to sell, and state, in short, that the utility did not have the right to terminate our contracts with the utility because they were executory contracts, and that the utility did not have the right to process customer requests to switch  to other retail energy providers   because the customers did not have the right to terminate our contracts, since they were executory contracts. 

As we have discussed,  it is an open issue as to whether our contracts are forward or non-forward contracts.  The arguments that these contracts are not forward contracts would be based on the theory  that our customer is not a forward contract merchant, that retail contracts are much more than commodity contracts and include numerous other   services, and that the  contract can only be terminated by a forward contract merchant.  If we receive some offers to buy the retail books, claiming that our contracts are non-forward contracts would maximize the value of EES because the customers would be prevented from terminating their contracts and would not be switched to new  retail energy providers.  However, on a long term basis,  there may be advantages to any retail business on a go forward basis to consider these contracts forward contracts.  This would allow energy providers in the future to terminate upon customer bankruptcies.  

At the trading issues meeting  Janet, Mike and I attended yesterday, it was the strong view of the group that the best position for Enron in the bankruptcy process was that retail contracts were forward contracts, and that this position should be taken on an Enron wide basis.  I am assuming that we will want someone in a commercial role to confirm that this is the position EES is being asked to take for the benefit of the overall estate, and that we should not, in any letters we are writing to the utilities, describe our contracts as executory and subject to the automatic stay of the bankruptcy court.  I think we would go forward with other parts of the letter to the utilities that is not inconsistent with the overall positions.

Please let me know if you need more info.  Thanks.
