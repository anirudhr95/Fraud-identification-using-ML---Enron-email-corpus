I just heard that Chris Gaffney is transferring to the Toronto office. His 
skill sets/capabilities have been critical in the closing of both the UI and 
NSTAR deals and he has been actively engaged in the long-term NSTAR deal, 
Con-Ed, and our Project Green Jacket. It is critical to our business to have 
no transitional period with attorneys and I expect his replacement to be 
fully up to speed (i.e. knowledge of the power market, understanding of 
structured power transactions, etc) relative to definitive documents around 
these transactions. Chris is definitely a loss to our team. Please advise as 
to his qualified replacement on these specific deals.  Thanks.

Subject: Investment Banking Fee to Bear, Stearns & Co.

In connection with our sale of shares/warrants in FirstWorld Communications 
to TPG Partners III, L.P. earlier this year, ENA engaged Bear, Stearns & Co. 
to assist ENA and Enron Communications as financial advisor and agent.  Kevin 
Garland sent me earlier this week (via Steve Horn) a copy of the 
corresponding engagement letter dated 01-Dec-99 and signed by Garland and 
Horn (and by Richard Lewis of Bear, Stearns).  It stipulates that Bear, 
Stearns shall receive as fee 2% of the aggregate consideration received by 
ENA, or $2,582,351 (plus $25,000 in out of pocket expenses).

Horn and Garland (and our accounting department) have confirmed to me that we 
have not previously paid any fee to Bear, Stearns for this transaction.  
Given the fact that the economics of the deal accrued to the account of ENA, 
it is probably only fair that we pay the fee.  I have instructed Stacy Hardy 
in accounting to wire the money prior to year end.

Sorry to hit you with this so late in the year, but I only found out about it 
two days ago.  Call me if you have questions.

 Office of the Chairman
From: Office of the Chairman@ENRON on 09/06/2000 05:10 PM
To: All Enron Worldwide
cc:  
Subject: Organizational Changes

In support of Enron,s continuing efforts to increase its return on invested 
capital and direct resources towards our highest return businesses, David 
Haug, Chairman and CEO of Enron CALME, Jim Hughes, President and COO of Enron 
APACHI, Joe Kishkill, Managing Director of Enron South America, and Frank 
Stabler, formerly a Managing Director of Enron CALME, will join Mark Metts in 
a corporate wide effort, to help monetize some of Enron,s assets.  David will 
help transition the CALME business activities into other parts of Enron while 
working with Mark on the asset monetization projects.  David will continue as 
an Executive Vice President for Enron Corp and a member of Enron,s Executive 
Committee.  Cliff Baxter will oversee this effort.

Consistent with these changes, the CALME group will be divided as follows.  
Enron Global LNG and Enron,s Caribbean Basin activities will become part of 
the new Enron Global Markets (EGM) group headed by Mike McConnell.  Rick 
Bergsieker, President/COO of LNG will continue in that role and in his dual 
role as President/COO of Enron Middle East, which will also join EGM. Shawn 
Cumberland, President and COO of the Caribbean Basin unit and his executive 
team will carry out the transition process for the Caribbean business unit's 
people and businesses as part of EGM.  Management of its Colombia and 
Venezuela businesses will transfer to Enron South America and its LNG-related 
activities to EGM as described above. 

The EES related initiatives and people will be transferred to those units.  
All of the various international businesses will participate as usual in the 
upcoming budget process with their new alignment and continue to meet their 
plan targets for 3rd and 4th quarters.

Concurrently, we are consolidating our trading and merchant activities in 
Japan and Australia into Enron Europe.  Joe Hirl and Paul Quilkey will report 
to Enron Europe,s Office of the Chairman.

We congratulate David Haug and Rebecca McDonald for proposing these 
realignments, which we agree, will maximize both the financial and 
intellectual capital in Enron.  Over the coming weeks, specific assignments 
and reporting relationships will be determined and communicated.

Subject: Deal Update

Dave,

Update from Friday Afternoon:

Coyote:  Avista Board approved a 50% equity investment in Coyote Springs II 
and publicly announced their intention to move forward.  Their equity 
partner, BP Amoco, indicated that they need 30 more days to ""get comfortable 
with the market"".  This thirty day period coincides with the expected 
financial close of June 15 so it may just be posturing to let us know that 
they are not committed until the deal actually closes.  Nevertheless, we 
(Avista and Enron) will pursue fallback investors that have already seen the 
project and previously expressed interest in a 50% share.  In parallel, we 
will try to get BP Amoco ""comfortable"".  It might make sense to consider 
someone else that can move quickly.  Deal probability drops from 80% to 50%.

LVCogen:  Vickers and Gilbert met with Sierra Pacific and confirmed their 
interest in and ability to effect a restructuring of the PPA.  Although 
timing of ""securitization"" is open-ended, Sierra has agreed to a contract 
valuation that supports a valuation uplift of $10MM - $14MM.  If we assume a 
40%-50% probability of restructuring, we get to the hotlisted $5MM gain for 
QII.   Attached is a spreadsheet that shows the breakup value of LVCogen.  
CTG and Power Structuring are finalizing the RAC models that support this 
approach.

Regards,

Chris

"Re: Potential Candidates for Reliable Reserves","Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the 
insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern 
(especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally 
and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market 
perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding 
multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys 
could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a 
well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John 
at the offsite):
 a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer 
list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination 
if this is a commercially viable product;
 b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure 
a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and 
come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had 
promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote 
this capability to these customers ASAP;
 c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP;
 d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need 
to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.

This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.

We are heading down the road of a gate keeper approach which has proven very 
inefficient at Enron in the past.    Our group has already canceled a meeting 
with the CFO of Vintage because of this approach.  Rerarding  industry 
relationships, George Carrick, Mark Tawney and I have extensive relationships 
throughout the upstream sector, know the decision makers and can set up our 
own meetings, all in coordination with the upstream group.  At this time I am 
waiting on John's group to set up our meetings.  Seems very inefficient.

The main objective is to determine if there is demand for the product.  I 
will continue to coordinate through John but we need to meet to clarify roles 
and responsibilities of all parties - how will deals be structured, who will 
price, who will negotiate transaction, etc.

Subject: Retail Branding

Dave, Pope has been working with the Stampeder organization for the last six 
months on creating a sponsorship package for our Retail business. Our first 
goal was to attempt to get the naming rights to McMahon Stadium (not unlike 
the Canadian Airlines Saddledome, Enron Field, etc.). At this point the 
naming rights are off the table. However, we have the opportunity to grab the 
naming rights to the Labour Day Classic as well as some other season-long 
involvement. Terms of the deal at this point are as follows:

1. ""Enron Labor day Classsic"" and 100 thirty-second radio spots promoting the 
Enron Labor day Classic + Newspaper Ads
 40,000 Enron logo cheering towels to be distributed pre-game
 Exclusive sponsorship on the cover of the game day program
 Enron logo on the player's jerseys

2. Season long involvement 
 End-Zone advertising
 1 full-page color ad in the Stamp's 2001 yearbook
 12 season tickets
 12 red & white club memberships

Cost would be approx $100K Cdn (still be negotiated). 

In terms of our overall strategy for branding, this is likely the only 
initiative that we would pursue in 2001 as we like that it has good 
penetration for the entire province of Alberta as well as national exposure. 
The Labour day game draws the biggest crowd each season, has been sold out 
eight out the past nine seasons, and is the largest single day sporting event 
in Calgary each year. Last year the ""battle of Alberta"" attracted over 
750,000 viewers on CBC. The timing is also very good as we will be fully 
functional by September. 

Let me know what you think.

Milnthorp

"ENA 2000 Offsite","Guys, can you start working on your presentations for the offsite.  

Dave I would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that 
you are working on for the IPP market which should be able to source short 
and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable(?) on the capital 
side.  Go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities. 
It may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of 
coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas 
markets and a quick view of the development process. How should we 
participate in this market?  Gasification technology?

Jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation 
sector ie) the technologies, the users, the VC's, etc.  Specifically, how 
will these technologies change our business model and the overall power 
business model?  How are we positioning ourselves in this market?  What is 
the PI strategy with this regard? 

Dorie Hitchcock and Tammy Sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; 
however, we need a first cut by December 8th.

Dave, I assume you are asking how we hedge the portion of JEDI II investments 
that will come back to us after the restructuring. As any buyout price for 
CALPERS will reflect the state of the assets at closing, I think we are well 
hedged until the closing of the restructuring. We can see if we can reserve 
some Raptor capacity upfront to hege us moving forward from the restructuring 
closin. If this does not answer your question, let me know.    Mike

Subject: Reporting Structure

Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

Delainey

Subject: Reporting Structure

Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to ""stay 
in the loop"" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards
Milnthorp

Subject: Moore Power Plant status

The following is a status update of key current items:
1. We continue to try to confirm the viability of the Peoples units.  We have 
not received NOx versus water injection data.  We still have not received the 
full noise spectrum data.  It looks like the only source for this is ABB and 
they're not fast.  Peoples and ourselves are going after ABB on these issues 
(and the possibility of a change order on the exciter design which doesn't 
meet Ontario specs).
 - we have confirmed that the municipality can provide 600 USGPM of water, 
but the silica content has to be confirmed to see if it's a problem.  I met 
with Terra Industrial Tuesday and they remain interested in providing the 
treated water, but they would have to expand their treatment plant.  They can 
provide 1/3rd of the water required and their permit can handle the waste 
stream on regen for the full water flow - we're sorting out the optimum tank 
capacity versus treatment plant capacity sizing to meet reliability at 
minimum cost.  Bottom line is we've got options to handle this water flow and 
we can avoid trying to get a permit for waste water.
 - we're going to use the noise consultant EE&CC used in conjunction with 
Agra Envir. in Canada to sort out the low frequency noise problem, and check 
the other frequencies against our nearest receptor, once we get the data from 
ABB.
 - Peoples are checking with ABB on the possibility of a change order on the 
exciter design.
2. MCN/Columbus have come back on the other two N2 units - they want another 
$1 MM US and can't confirm any changes to the contract.
We are completing our comparison of the Peoples/MCN contracts - the MCN 
contract is much better (guarantees, liquidated damages etc.) but of course 
power output is less.
3. We kicked off Agra to prepare our permit amendment (using data from both 
the Peoples N2's and MCN N2's).
4. NEPCO capital cost estimate will be ready June 9th.  It looks like $2-3 MM 
will come out of the base estimate for the N1's due to the acceleration and 
winter work coming out.  They still have to do the N2 estimate.  There might 
be a chance to push this ahead to the end of the 7th if we were to pressure 
them more.
5. We feel we can increase our N1 output up by 6 MW at 90F without 
incremental O&M.  The Peoples units would add an incremental 40 MW at 90F.

Using the Peoples units our capital per kW at 90 F is $397 US/kW (using our 
original $156 MM incl. IDC estimate less $2 MM).
Using the MCN units our capital per kW at 90F is $443 US/kW.

Issues:
1. We are not getting great support from Houston in many areas, with the 
exception of some like Don Miller/Genco.  It appears that some groups like 
underwriting/RAC and structuring either are getting the message this project 
is not going ahead, or are taking our continued delays in approval to work on 
all of their other priorities (hoping that we will go away presumably...).  
Schedule becomes more of a concern every day.
2. The Ontario interconnection timing becomes more and more of a concern each 
day that passes as OH isn't the fastest working entity.  Aleck and Duncan 
continue to work the IMO/OHSC/OEB angles but with some of the rules not set 
yet we may need higher level pressure at some time soon.  I'll let you know.

Subject: An Associate who loves EA so much

Dear Mr Delainey:

We met in the Associate Orientation last summer when you asked me if I would 
like to join ENA for my first rotation. But since our first rotation was
assigned instead of chosen by ourselves, I was in no position to accept your 
kindly invitation. Now that I am two months away from finishing my
first rotation, I remembered our conversation during the Orientation and was 
more than eager to send you this  email hoping that your invitation is
still open.

I would love to join ENA (EA).  I believe by doing so, I will be given the 
opportunity to work with the smartest people in this industry.
I also believe I am prepared to join the trading unit in ENA.  I have five 
years' experience in Metals trading - both physical and financial. At
business school at UT Austin, I chose Energy Finance as my concentration and 
enjoyed tremendously these courses:

Risk management: Swap, Options, Delta and Vega hedge,...
Financial Strategy for Energy Companies: Financial decisions on investment 
and long-term hedge, ...
Financial Engineering: Case studies on financial products invented by 
Investment banks
Real Option Valuation: Decision making process considering the optionality in 
the future
Energy Law: Regulation and Environment issues in Energy Industry.

All this above and my passion for this industry and Enron  give me confidence 
to explore the opportunity to work in ENA. Only if you could
give me five minutes of your precious time to allow me to prove my 
qualifications, I will greatly appreciate it.

Have another  great year!

Summary of emails detailed below:

Dave Delainey and Kevin Presto have authorized Enron protests of utilities 
seeking to renew their market based rates for power sales.  Enron has already 
filed detailed protests against AEP, Entergy, and Southern Energy Marketing.  
We also plan to file a detailed protest of Hydro Quebec.

Protests of the following utilities will be very short (shown below) stating 
that FERC should condition the continuation of market based rates upon the 
utility joining a valid fully functioning RTO. ((Ameren, FP&L, LGE/KU, 
Cinergy, TXU, VEPCO, and Duke).  Protests will be due over the next few 
months.

Please let me know if you want to receive copies of the protests or drafts.

Kevin said this looks good w/ these changes:

and last para:  Add after December 15, 2001 deadline  ""or if a transmission 
owner does not join a fully functioning RTO that meets all of the 
Commission's requirements"" 

This needs to get filed today, if possible, as a request for rehearing in 
Ameren Docket ER00-2687-001.  Note:  There were no interventions or protests 
in this docket and FERC issued a letter order accepting the filing on Nov. 
2.  What is odd and should be pointed out for why we are intervening at this 
time is that there may have been a problem with when or how the notice was 
issued.  Neither Nancy P. or our paralegal Jan saw this notice.  I found it 
after the intervention date.  It is certainly odd that there were no 
interventions in this at all.  One concern for Dan/Joe/Jim:  Since this is 
going in as a late intervention and request for rehearing, what is the 
likelihood of the Commission tossing the whole idea out quickly because of 
the late intervention, which may hurt our overall cause.

Next, this is the list of those utilities that we plan to file this pleading 
in (We are not protesting Xcel/NSP/Pub Serv of Co):

FP&L MAYBE Docket No. 97-3359-003 Protests due 11/20
Cinergy (due in Jan)
TXU (due in Jan)

Subject: GE 7FA

Dave,

A DASH will be circulating later today for approximately $16MM for $10MM of 
progress payments on a 7FA and certain development costs for our Longview 
Project.  Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to 
get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued 
use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for 
some reason.  Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the 
money using Enron mid curves for gas and power.  

Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with 
GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed 
tomorrow.
I am highly confident that this will result in a 2001 gain of $15MM-$20MM.   

I was planning to talk with Louise about this at our call this morning.  Are 
you or she the appropriate signor for EA?  I will also contact Mark Frevert 
early this afternoon to discuss.   

Regards,

Chris

Dave,

I am sending this in response to your query regarding the slow payment from 
Wheeling Pittsburgh.  Wheeling Pittsburgh has allegedly filed bankruptcy some 
time last week.  Legal is trying to obtain the bankruptcy filing we are 
beginning to solidfy our potential claim.   Our current exposure is 
approximately $1.55mm ($1.07mm in receivable and $375k MTM).  We are working 
with the steel team (the deal was orginated by Tammy Mulrooney) and legal to 
determine our rights under our contract.  We will keep you posted with any 
updates.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Bill

"CONFIDENTIAL - Tennessee political contributions","Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible 
to get this out of either the trading or origination group.  As a significant 
contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room.  
Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Tennessee political contributions

On September 29th I sent you an email regarding requests for personal 
political contributions to Tennessee lawmakers.  If you or any others intend 
to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible.   The 
election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final 
decisions on media spending.  Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying 
firm in Nashville.

The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law 
prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action 
committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. 
supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office 
materials, etc...).  Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a 
stringent campaign finance law. 

The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up 
to the business units with interests in Tennessee. 

If you need further information or would like to discuss this, you can reach 
me at 614-760-7472 or 614-306-4359 (cell).

Barbara, we are getting tremendous pressure for contributions in these last 
days before the election.  As I have mentioned to you, Enron has been 
referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators.  Also, Lt. 
Gov. Wilder's campaign chairman called me in the latter part of last week, 
hoping for significant financial help for end-of-campaign TV buys.  Gif 
Thornton, Robert Gowan, and I are participating heavily; I cannot 
overemphasize the importance of Enron's participation.  The state ""money 
crunch"" which existed this past year likely will be worse when the General 
Assembly reconvenes (tax collections are coming in below estimates), and all 
existing tax exemptions will be at significant risk.  Please do what you can 
to get some Enron assistance for the candidates which we have discussed now.  
Thanks.  Bill

Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I 
expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday 
is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of 
service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost 
and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other 
business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy. 

I make money you make money.

Kevin,

How are things going?  Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal 
with California or the wildfires out west?  Things are going well for us 
here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting) 
and Europe (96/97).  The Japanese utilities are not being too original in 
their approach... same playbook.  Regardless of all of this, looking at sites 
and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look 
quite promising.  Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing 
LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the 
characteristics.

You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your 
efforts at adding capacity in the East.  Along these lines would you know of 
anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?  
Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.  Let me know.

Joe

You should be moving down the road on the deconstruction, refurbishment and

Randy, please facilitate. Mike, can we put the screws to ABB given the 
significant transformer business we forwarded their way?

Laura, we probably need to make a call on the Peoples turbine pretty soon.

Eric/Rob, I think we need to see the project with IDC come in  between 350 to

To: Kyle Kitagawa/CAL/ECT@ECT, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT
cc:  
Subject: Moore Power Plant status

The following is a status update of key current items:
1. We continue to try to confirm the viability of the Peoples units.  We have 
not received NOx versus water injection data.  We still have not received the 
full noise spectrum data.  It looks like the only source for this is ABB and 
they're not fast.  Peoples and ourselves are going after ABB on these issues 
(and the possibility of a change order on the exciter design which doesn't 
meet Ontario specs).
 - we have confirmed that the municipality can provide 600 USGPM of water, 
but the silica content has to be confirmed to see if it's a problem.  I met 
with Terra Industrial Tuesday and they remain interested in providing the 
treated water, but they would have to expand their treatment plant.  They can 
provide 1/3rd of the water required and their permit can handle the waste 
stream on regen for the full water flow - we're sorting out the optimum tank 
capacity versus treatment plant capacity sizing to meet reliability at 
minimum cost.  Bottom line is we've got options to handle this water flow and 
we can avoid trying to get a permit for waste water.
 - we're going to use the noise consultant EE&CC used in conjunction with 
Agra Envir. in Canada to sort out the low frequency noise problem, and check 
the other frequencies against our nearest receptor, once we get the data from 
ABB.
 - Peoples are checking with ABB on the possibility of a change order on the 
exciter design.
2. MCN/Columbus have come back on the other two N2 units - they want another 
$1 MM US and can't confirm any changes to the contract.
We are completing our comparison of the Peoples/MCN contracts - the MCN 
contract is much better (guarantees, liquidated damages etc.) but of course 
power output is less.
3. We kicked off Agra to prepare our permit amendment (using data from both 
the Peoples N2's and MCN N2's).
4. NEPCO capital cost estimate will be ready June 9th.  It looks like $2-3 MM 
will come out of the base estimate for the N1's due to the acceleration and 
winter work coming out.  They still have to do the N2 estimate.  There might 
be a chance to push this ahead to the end of the 7th if we were to pressure 
them more.
5. We feel we can increase our N1 output up by 6 MW at 90F without 
incremental O&M.  The Peoples units would add an incremental 40 MW at 90F.

Using the Peoples units our capital per kW at 90 F is $397 US/kW (using our 
original $156 MM incl. IDC estimate less $2 MM).
Using the MCN units our capital per kW at 90F is $443 US/kW.

Issues:
1. We are not getting great support from Houston in many areas, with the 
exception of some like Don Miller/Genco.  It appears that some groups like 
underwriting/RAC and structuring either are getting the message this project 
is not going ahead, or are taking our continued delays in approval to work on 
all of their other priorities (hoping that we will go away presumably...).  
Schedule becomes more of a concern every day.
2. The Ontario interconnection timing becomes more and more of a concern each 
day that passes as OH isn't the fastest working entity.  Aleck and Duncan 
continue to work the IMO/OHSC/OEB angles but with some of the rules not set 
yet we may need higher level pressure at some time soon.  I'll let you know.

"Re: Signature authority","Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with 
some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant 
control issue.

Mark, is this widespread in ENA?

Well, I talked with legal about this and I understand that they can and do 
give signature authority to directors on a relatively frequent basis. I gave 
them the parameters for Ben to make it even easier. If they end up saying 
it's a bigger issue than originally articulated, I'll continue with Ben as we 
currently have it.  Thanks.

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Subject: Great words


David,  

I hope all is well.  I had another good week at pulp and paper.  As you know 
I have an affinity for technology trading.  I thought you would enjoy the 
fine words below as you start a new week.  

Time is your most precious possession-and the hands of time move swiftly 
onward.  Fasten this warning deep into your mind, not for sorrow,s sake, but 
to remind yourself that today may be all you have.  Now is the time for you 
to move forward. Now is the time for you to stand and be counted.  The ground 
is now ready for you to plant the seeds of a new vision, one that will bear 
only the finest fruit.  It is time to focus on what you want, to turn dreams 
into realities so that you are able to spend your life in the manner in which 
you desire.  It is later than you think.    Too many of us waste our years 
waiting for better times in the future or reflecting upon better times in the 
past, instead of working for better times in the present.  --------------- If 
only we had better schooling, better opportunities, or better resources. 
If,if,if!  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow!  
-------------------------------------

Today is always here; yesterday is gone; and tomorrow never comes.  Time 
offers opportunity but demands a sense of urgency.  Now is the time.  This is 
the place.  You are the one!

Those who leave a legacy of achievement master the art of living in the now- 
the ability to make each moment count.  Here are their tips.

? First, they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy.
? Second, they use each moment to maximum advantage.
? Third, they are bent on making a contribution to humanity.
? Fourth, they learn from their mistakes.
? Fifth, they concentrate on the task at hand.
? Sixth, they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past.
? Seventh, they simply refuse to allow the weight of an unpleasant 
circumstance to encumber their thoughts or objectives.

                                                                              
               Dennis P. Kimbroa

I think technology is made up of a number of tradable commodities.  These 
commodities are volatile and trading them will add value to ENA.  I would 
like the opportunity to create this group.

Best wishes,

M. A. Moulton

Do we want to go into more detail on the nature of the alliance, the target 
market and the nature of the excusivity (ie) wholesale renewables 
applications, ENA, major state programs - all of it based upon the Conneticut

Subject: NSTAR 6-month Transaction


I would like to personally thank and congratulate everyone involved in 
helping ENA bring closure to the NSTAR wholesale power transaction.  Any 
transaction of this nature requires support from many people and I appreciate 
everyone's hard work in making this transaction a reality.  In addition, I 
believe ENA is well positioned for a longer term transaction with NSTAR.   I 
would encourage John Llodra and Jeff Ader to work closely together to create 
the best value proposition for Enron on the long term deal.
Strict Confidentiality language is embedded in the 6-month NSTAR transaction, 
and it is extremely important that everyone involved honors the zero 
tolerance nature of this Confidentiality provision.  The bottom line is that 
we cannot disclose anything about this deal to any third partiies, including 
the mere existence of the deal.   If we do not respect this provision fully, 
we will jeapordize our goodwill with the customer and thus our ability to 
move forward with a longer term transaction.  In addtion, there could be 
negative legal ramnifications.

Thanks again for a job well done.  If I missed anyone who was involved in the 
transaction, please forward this e-mail to those individuals.

Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a 
list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a 
definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could 
be acted upon.

 a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.;
 b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day 
and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.;
 c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 
5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.;
 d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel ""header"" - Jean M.;
 e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and 
contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.;
 f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - 
working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al 
- Patrick   W.
 
 I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to 
determine a final action plan.

Regards
Delainey

"Re: Devil's Tower","Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play 
given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the 
customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?  
Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated 
structure in the RFP?

Is this a play that you would support? 

On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso 
note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to 
quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.

How is it going otherwise?

Subject: Re: Devil's Tower  

David,

Devils Tower is a deepwater project on Mississippi Canyon block 773.  
Dominion is the operator and has a 60% working interest in the project.  
Mariner Energy (20%) and Pioneer Resources (20%) are the remaining working 
interest owners.

During the first week of September, Production Offshore, managed by Tom 
Byargeon, received an RFP and an information packet to submit a proposal for 
the development of a floating production system and export pipelines.

Since the Devils Towers project exists in a prolific active deepwater reserve 
area and this area has little developed infrastructure, this project is 
strategic and creates a very relevant and marketable infrastructure 
position.  For example, Exxon has indicated their interest in tying back 
their production from Crazy Horse (south of Devils Tower) to this platform.  
In addition, the production from this platform could be funneled into Exxon's 
export pipelines on the shelf.

This project will financed by a structure where Enron forms a joint venture 
(JV) with an independent third party.   The joint venture partners capitalize 
the JV with a nominal amount of funds.  The JV leases capacity on the 
platform and export pipelines from a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  The SPV 
uses the lease agreement to obtain a loan from financial institutions.  In 
turn, the SPV uses equity capital (from a tax based investor) and the loan 
proceeds to purchase or develop the deepwater assets.

The JV receives cash flows from leasing the production capacity from the 
Devils Tower deepwater assets.  This capacity on the deepwater assets will be 
sold for five to seven years under a production handling agreement (PHA).  
Final point, the JV receives a financial instrument (most likely a note 
receivable)  equal to their portion of the net proceeds from the PHA.

Enron books income on the monetization of this financial instrument via a 
FASB sell down (most likely, selling a note receivable to a bank for cash).  
In addition, because the lease capacity for the deepwater assets will be sold 
for only five-seven years and these assets will have a minimum working life 
for twenty, there exists potential upside for Enron.  For example, cash flows 
from incremental PHAs (ie., through tiebacks to Devils Tower deepwater 
assets) can be monetized via the FASB 125 sell down.

The financial structure was designed to minimize capital outlays and 
financial risk.  Also, Joe Deffner and Roger Ondreko are very familar with 
the structure and assisted in its design.

The RFP is due October 2nd.   There will a meeting tommorrow from 1-3 pm to 
discuss the status of the proposal in EB 3583. Please feel free to attend.

Regards, 

Jean

Subject: TVA Status


Hey Dave. We are focused on selling our interests in the Calvert City, Ky. 
site now that we've successfully transferred the AES sale from Calvert City 
to Haywood. We have two counterparties that have shown a high degree of 
interest in Calvert City: Duke and Cleco. There are no issues surrounding 
Cleco but there may be with Duke from the following standpoint: our Calvert 
City site is ahead of Duke's Calvert City site in the interconnect que. 
Apparently, TVA erroneously did not factor in our interconnect application 
into their facilities study for Duke, and gave Duke an indication that there 
should not be material transmission upgrade costs for their plant 
interconnect. As both TVA and Duke now realize, our interconnect status does 
present a problem for Duke (and therefore TVA). We plan to talk with Duke in 
parallel with Cleco and I anticipate Duke then confronting TVA with the 
situation. 

I want to ensure our discussions with TVA and Duke over the next few weeks 
don't jeopardize our settlement with TVA. Will this settlement be closed by 
mid-January (thought that's what I heard)? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would 
suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:

 It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an 
effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant   
investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is 
important for the following reasons:
  a) provides an additional ""Friend of Enron"" to facilitate short to medium 
term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity 
and capital transactions in the wholesale group;
  b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and
  c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral 
benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.

ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor 
and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.

Dave -

FYI.  

While comprehensive electricity reform legislation looks very dead, there are 
those that are pushing ""stand-alone"" legislation before Congress.  Attached 
is a letter that Enron will sign on to that opposes stand-alone PUHCA 
reform.   This bill is being pushed by Mid-American.

Government Affairs continues to oppose all stand-alone legislation.  
Basically our only real leverage is to keep PUHCA, PURPA, reliability, and 
wholesale access legislation linked in a comprehensive bill.  This may incent 
the holdouts to agree to our needs.

If you need any additional information, please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

Dave,

FYI on the content of this proposed interview.

My suggestion to PR was to have you and/or John L. be the primary 
interviewees, with me sitting by your side to add local commentary (if 
needed).  I was trying to take the story in the following direction:  Enron 
is now applying its successful NA business model to South America...these are 
the things we will be doing now...these are the things we will be doing in 
the future...discuss logic of the split of assets versus commercial business 
units...this is a natural step in the evolution of the South AMerican market 
and in the evolution of Enron...etc.

I have not called you since I figure you are crushed under the post holiday 
""pile"".  I will be in Houston Thursday (one day ahead of PRC) in the EB on 
floor 49.

We are surviving down here and moving forward.  I need to pick your brain 
about an agenda for your visit next week when convenient for you (earlier is 
obviously better for us)

Thanks,

Hi Keith,
Here's some thoughts we have on the story. Of course, like Enron, we're
willing to be flexible, depending on what we find out.

 Since it began in 1985, Enron has always been in the vanguard of U.S.
companies getting into new markets overseas, from India, where the company
made the largest single private investment in the country's history, to
Japan where the company recently announced it will build its first power
plant. How has the company overcome political obstacles and cultural
differences to establish itself internationally?
 This will focus more on South America than the rest of the world. I'll
look
at the transition from working on pipeline projects in South America to the
more service-oriented business in Argentina. Also, what about workers - do
you hire local management and oversee the operations from Houston? IF so,
why? I'll also look at the pipeline and the creation of this natural gas
market in South America. How did the project ultimately turn out for
residents & customers there? What does Enron see in its future in South
America.


I know this is pretty vague, but I expect to do more research in the coming
weeks and have it more ironed out.

David:

I met with you last December/January in connection with working for Enron.
At that time Enron made me an offer to work in your group.  I made the
decision to not accept the offer.  The main reason was that I could not
digest the concept of leaving BP Amoco less than six months after I had
joined them.

I am still with BP Amoco and they continue to treat me real well.  At the
same time, I now realize that I made  a stupid mistake in turning down the
Enron offer.  If you are willing to reconsider, I would love to talk to you.
Considering what I put you through the last time, if you do not want to
reconsider, I can understand.

David, I would appreciate it I can meet with you in person to discuss this
further with you.  If you are okay with it, can I buy you lunch and talk
about this.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Subject: EES Organizational Announcement

Enron Energy Services has created explosive growth in the retail energy 
business.  To advance EES, leadership position and to rapidly expand the 
reach of its energy management services, the company is forming four new 
business groups and promoting several key individuals.

EES continues to see an ever-increasing demand for energy management services 
in North America, with interest coming from a growing number of customer 
classes.  EES North America, headed by Marty Sunde, President and CEO, has 
been established to bring outsourcing, commodity and mid-market solutions to 
industrial and commercial customers in North America.  Harold Buchanan and 
Jeremy Blachman have been named co-Chief Operating Officers of the group.

EES Europe is responsible for energy outsourcing across Europe, as well as 
rapidly growing mid-market business (Enron Direct, Enron Directo) and heavy 
industrial business (ETOL).  Matthew Scrimshaw, President and CEO will lead 
this group.

As EES and Enron,s customer base grows, world class execution capabilities 
and customer relationship management skills are required to maximize value. 
Global Energy Services, headed by Dan Leff, President and CEO, is being 
established to manage execution, delivery, operations & maintenance, account 
/ customer management and contract value enhancement of Enron,s asset and 
energy outsourcing activities worldwide.  This group will include Enron 
Facility Services (EFS), led by Joe Earle, President & CEO and Operational 
Energy Corporation (OEC), led by Mark Dobler, Vice President.

EES continues to see additional opportunities for business that will benefit 
from the growth of its energy outsourcing business.  To manage and develop 
these new business opportunities, EES New Business Ventures has been 
created.  Mark Muller, President and CEO will lead this group.

All four new business leaders will report directly to EES, Office of the 
Chairman, Lou Pai, who will continue as Chairman, and Tom White, who will 
continue as Vice Chairman.  In addition, Kevin Hughes, Vice President and 
Chief Accounting Officer, Vicki Sharp, Managing Director and General Counsel, 
and Beth Tilney, Managing Director of Marketing, HR and Customer Satisfaction 
will continue to report to the Office of the Chairman.

Please join us in congratulating these individuals.

Dave, I missed one point regarding the Toronto trader. Lavorato and Belden 
have identified an associate and he's interested in coming to Toronto. He is 
in Toronto today meeting with DeVries. As a sidebar, our new office space in 
Toronto is extremely impressive (cost was Cdn $500K) and is a great selling

Subject: Re: Status Report, CRP & DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIALS  

Dave, thanks for the note. Regarding an update for Toronto, we made an offer 
to a senior industrial marketer yesterday  (Jeff Borg - 10 years experience) 
while I was in Toronto. I believe that he will accept. In addition, Paul is 
interviewing for one more deal maker (targeting John Guerro at Duke - an 
industrial gas marketer) and a manager for ENERconnect   (has interviewed a 
couple - meeting with Doug Jones from TD Bank next week). 

Scott Gilbert who is running our volume management is out recruiting for 
backoffice staff (needs 5 specialists). No success here as of yet.

Mark Haedicke, Peter Keohane and myself are working on transferring Chris 
Gaffney (Canadian Lawyer) to work in Toronto. Chris is interested and both 
Mark and myself think it would be a good fit/career move.

Dawn, Paul and myself are devising a more aggressive recruiting strategy for 
Toronto for both Paul's and Scott's groups as our presence in Toronto is 
limited. This may include full page ads in the Globe, use of head hunters 
and/or Super Saturdays. With 2 million people in Toronto, we should be having 
more success in recruiting high quality individuals.

It is my understanding that 94 new analysts are starting this August in 
Houston. I need a minimum of 5 (2 for Toronto, 3 for Calgary). I have asked 
Dawn to make this happen, but if there is any way that you can exercise your 
influence to assist in making this happen, that would be much appreciated. 

Regards
Milnthorp

"Westinghouse LD's for Gleason/Wheatland","Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the 
increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.  
Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in 
any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower 
than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value 
or multiple value based on 90 degree output.

I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue 
rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time 
but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that 
the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really 
get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of 
Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed 
for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.

The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost 
savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital 
cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee 
we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized 
so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.

My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and 
adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.

Subject: Westinghouse LD's for Gleason/Wheatland

Given the probable sale of these 2 facilities, I would like clarification on 
the LD proceeds from Westinghouse.  See questions/points below.

1)  Izzo has claimed that you (Delainey) has agreed to pay EE&CC for 
construction services in the form of Westinghouse LD payments.  Is this 
correct?
2)  I am concerned that EE&CC will settle for cash payment from Westihnghouse 
(Heat Rate & Schedule penalties) rather than increased output.
3)  Given a sale at $450/kW, increased output is worth $5 million vs. the 
$1-2 million we would collect for schedule and Heat Rate LD's.
4)  My recommendation is to trade the HR and schedule shortfall for increased 
output at Gleason to maximize total Enron profitability.

From ENA's perspective we should collect the schedule penalty at Wheatland 
only and insist on the 12 MW additional output at Gleason.  This combination 
provides the best value to Enron.

If Izzo's form of payment for the construction jobs is Westinghouse LD's, 
then he will be motivated to recieve cash payment.  Please provide me the 
necessary feedback to ensure that we do the right thing for Enron.

Thanks Dave.

Subject: Hoecker letter

The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC 
commissioners.  Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before 
the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the 
press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are 
also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which 
focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is 
that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and 
therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market 
power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of 
California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected 
that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other 
hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the 
staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment 
and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our 
best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting 
the report and order under wraps until wednesday.

"Please note Change ""Mid-year 2000 Performance Review Process""","       Please note the Change:
    ENA VP Pre-Ranking Committee Meeting -July 7     


As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention 
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a 
number of important tasks and projects in process.  While recognizing this, 
it remains extremely important to take time over the next few weeks to gather 
necessary information to provide quality and meaningful feedback for our 
employees, as well as utilize this information during the year end review 
process.

In the spirit of One Enron, the Performance Review Process (PRC) will be 
global for Mid-year 2000.  Vice Presidents and above across all operating 
companies will be reviewed and discussed in a consistent manner with 
identical criteria.   ENA will review all professional level and above 
employees.  The timeline and training for the midyear process are outlined at 
the end of this memo.  Your HR Business Consultant is also available to 
answer questions.

With regards to the Global Functions, review sessions will be led by the 
Global and/or Corporate Functional heads, and will be designed to calibrate 
personnel within these areas of expertise.  The Global Functional Review 
Areas include:

_ NetWorks/Technology
_ Accounting
_ RAC
_ Finance
_ Human Resources
_ Public Relations & Reg Affairs	G. Whalley
	R. Causey
	R.  Buy
	A. Fastow
	C. Olson
	S. Kean
       
ENA Mid-Year Process:

ENA has received favorable feedback on the review process used for Mid-year 
and Year-end 1999, and as such, will follow the same general guidelines and 
process for Mid-year 2000.  The following are key features of the Mid-year 
2000 process:

o The focus of the feedback will continue to be on the qualitative aspects, 
as opposed to quantitative.  Toward this end, communication of the employee,s 
explicit ranking will be left to the discretion of the business unit manager.
o Initial discussions with employees regarding their accomplishments, are 
highly encouraged, prior to the Business Review Meetings.
o Mid-year performance results will be used as baseline performance 
information for Year-end 2000.
o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups.  
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale.  
o All exempt employees will be discussed at Business Review Meetings and 
placed into one of six categories by peer group.  ENA VP's will be pre-ranked 
by the ENA Office of the Chairman and Managing Directors prior to the Enron 
PRC.  Non-exempt (overtime eligible) employees will be evaluated by their 
supervisors and placed into one of the 6 categories.  The results of the 
Business Review Meetings will be the final rankings for exempt employees 
below VP, subject to ENA Office of the Chairman.
o A minimum of two representatives from other functional areas will be 
required at the Business Review Meetings.  The meetings should otherwise be 
rescheduled to allow this very important representation to take place.  The 
nominated individuals are illustrated below.
o The top 5 HR priorities/challenges for 2000 should also be agreed to at the 
Business Review Meetings.
o Analysts and Associates will be pre-reviewed in a Business Review Meetings 
based on their current rotation, then cross-calibrated at the Enron Global 
Analyst and Associate Business Review Meeting.

Peer Groups:

 Commercial
 Commercial Support
 Technical
 Specialized Technical

Performance Criteria (for all peer groups):

Innovation/Entrepreneurship
Communication/Setting Direction
Teamwork/Interpersonal
Leadership/Vision/Values 
Business Instinct
Analytical/Technical

Guidelines:

o Use of multiple sources of input is encouraged (employee, peers, direct 
reports, internal customers, external customers), as is a self-evaluation
o Employees should recommend 5-10 reviewers to Supervisor and Supervisor 
should select at least three of the employee,s recommendations
o All feedback must be entered via the Performance Management System located 
on the intranet
o Supervisor should consolidate the feedback, prepare a draft of the 
Performance Review form and meet with the employee prior to the Business 
Review meeting
o Final feedback to exempt employee follows the July 7th meeting
o For VP's & MD's, final feedback follows the Enron Executive Committee 
Meeting

Responsibilities / Actions:

The following list represents suggested groups and the individuals 
responsible for each Business Review Meeting.  Attendees at the meetings are 
appropriate Supervisors within the Business Unit.  In addition, the Office of

As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment

origination would fall within the central region.  Specifically opportunities 
with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this 
division and I have no desire to start any new issues or create larger 
organizational issues.   In the gas re-organization, how did you 
strategically divide Eastern Canada?

I would appreciate your direction or decision.

Edith Cross and I looked at the Fort James deal in great detail in early 
1999.  When the deal was closed, west power trading booked an in the money 
position and an offsetting expense of about $11 million.  This money has 
already liquidated from our book.  In fact, I have a copy of the 3/31/97 DPR 
that reflects this liquidation.  At that time, west power trading also paid a 
350k credit reserve, 247k to the finance book, and 1.3 million in 
origination.  

I have also heard about a ""partnership"" fee that Enron paid to Fort James 
around the same time.  I'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from 
it.  It had nothing to do with the west power trading book.

On John's recommendation I called Wes to see if we could figure this out.  
Wes, please give me a call back to discuss.  I think that someone needs to 
look at the actual journal entries from March of 1997 to see why an expense 
of $11 million was deferred.

This is not my problem.  I should not receive this expense.  Until this is 
resolved, I would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred 
account does not hit west power trading's expenses.

Subject: On-sight Power Generation Reclamation Business Plan





I recently read articles about Enron Corporation in Fortune magazine  and 
Business Week, and was encouraged by your success in building a  flexible and 
innovative workforce. I admire this type of approach from a leader  of a 
large, multi-national company. 

Based on Enron,s initiatives to market and sell wholesale electricity, and  
the recent power shortages across various regions of the country, I was  
motivated to develop a business opportunity utilizing my experience and  
knowledge of the on-site power generation market. I realized that an 
unregulated  utility company could take advantage of existing, unused 
stand-by generator  capacity.

My plan sells the excess capacity of these generators in the spot energy  
market, when the on-site generators are commanded to power customer base 
loads,  thereby freeing up an equivalent amount of energy. My plan requires 
minimal  capital investment, produces a sales volume of $2.0M, and a net 
profit of  $400,000.00 in year one. The attached business plan and three-year 
pro forma P  & L statement provide further details.

I strongly believe this idea can and will provide a solid return on  
investment. My goal is to heighten your interest enough to warrant further  
discussion on the possibility of Enron integrating this business plan into 
its  existing network of marketing, trading and selling electricity.

I chose to market this plan to Enron due to its leadership in the 
deregulated  electricity market, and its corporate culture of innovation and 
swift action.  Enron also has the name recognition, resources and national 
presence required to  make this plan successful.

I look forward to hearing from you on the merit of my business plan, and the  
feasibility of integrating it into your company.

Thank you for your time.

Subject: Re: Fort James Amortization  

I try to run clean, conservative books.  To that end, I assessed every single 
originated transaciton when I took over the group in 1999.  Edith Cross and I 
turned over every rock that we could find, booked things properly, and moved 
on.  I know nothing about this amortization that's been going on.  Perhaps 
there were two payments to Fort James -- one being the payment that west 
power trading expensed in 1997 associated with the in money Wauna/Halsey 
position and the other associated with the overall alliance.  West Power 
Trading very clearly liquidated the payment associated with Wauna/Halsey in 
1997.  I have the DPR from March of 1997 to prove it.  If this payment was 
capitalized for some reason after West Power Trading expensed it, then I'm 
not sure what to do.  It seems odd for us to pay for the same bad position 
twice.  

If the amortization is associated with the second payment to Fort James -- 
the alliance payment -- then we have a different kettle of fish entirely.  I 
don't understand why it was ok for the amotization to hit the industrial 
group but when we do a one-time amortization of the balance it all of a 
sudden switches over to the West Power Trading group.  How come last month it 
was ""proper"" for the charge to hit the industrial group and this month it is 
""proper"" for the charge to hit West Power Trading.  The charge should hit 
whoever's rc it was who thought that paying Fort James a bunch of money was a 
good idea.  If that person is no longer around the charge should either hit 
that person's successor or it should hit a management book.

To your point about who benefits from the termination of this deal.  Clearly, 
it is a good idea to terminate these deals and remove bad positions with a 
lot of uncertainty from the West Power Trading books.  Having said that, I 
have a hard time feeling good about the ""benefit"" that West Power Trading has 
received from these deals.  In 1999 I was told that this was largely a legal 
question.  A memo written by Jake Thomas on April 7, 1999 memorializes this 
line of thought.  We established a $500k legal reserve, rebooked the deals, 
took most of the positive value to the book to offset large losses associated 
with other old deals and granted the remainder, about $1 million, to Jake in 
origination.  The entity that has benefited the most from these deals is West 
Origination.

Finally, I can't see how this expense belongs to West Power Trading.  I would 
like to understand how all of the accounting worked before I can accept an 
expense on my rc.  If you want to deal with the expense separately and have a 
discussion about granting origination for terminating this deal then let's do 
that.  That discussion needs to reflect history, and include the origination 
that was granted in 1997, 1999, and include the legal reserve of $500k.

Give me a call when you get a chance.

John, thanks for the update. I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis 
this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current 
terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent 
that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK 
with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. 
This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated 
acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure 
that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on 
point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please 
ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available 
to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of 
days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all 
internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of 
you if he needs to.  

Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to 
""Regional Management"" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and 
Trading. 

Thanks and good luck!

Subject: Draft DASH for CMP Standard Offer Deal

All:

As some of you may be aware, we are in the process of negotiating with 
Central Maine Power Company regarding the assumption of a portion of their 
wholesale obligations associated with their Standard Offer Service load in 
the State of Maine, covering at least March 1, 2001 - Feb 28, 2002.   We are 
currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.  
They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.  At this point, 
there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items 
and credit arrangements).  However, we expect that the pace of the 
negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an 
example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine 
PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract 
within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm 
pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for 
about 2-3 hours).

Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:

Origination/Marketing:  John Llodra, George Wood
Legal:  Janice Moore
Regulatory/Governmental:  Daniel Allegretti
Commodity Structuring:  Jim Meyn, Zach Sampson
Credit:  Edward Sacks, Tracy Ngo

Attached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.  Items 
subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is 
prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a 
chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 
28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you 
all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move 
quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with 
CMP over the next couple of days.  Once agreement is reached with CMP on 
outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.  Please feel free to 
call me at 978-449-9936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-3223, 
3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to 
date.  Thanks.

John

Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss 
to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing 
this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems 
to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are 
meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should 
keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on

Dave --

Alstom ESCA is holding ""Summit 2000"" in Las Vegas Oct 16 - Oct 17.  The 
purpose of the meeting is to bring together people from throughout the 
industry to discuss key issues.  

Alstom ESCA is a French company that builds EMS systems in the US.  They 
developed the EMS for Enron's control areas.  We are working with them on 
Project e-trans (the RTO software).

The first panel in the am on Monday involves Re-regulation and Competition.  
They would like someone from Enron to present and participate.  Right now, 
they have  Pacificorp and are trying to get someone from government in PA and 
CA.  The presentation / speech is 10 - 15 minutes followed by 30 minutes of 
Q&A for the panel.

Do you have any interest in presenting?  This could be a good opportunity to 
deliver our message throughout the industry.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

Koenig/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Mellencamp/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Ecogas/Fidelity issue

Dave - I think I've worked out a solution to the Fidelity problem.  Enron 
North America and Fidelity will agree to a back to back Put/Call option 
whereby after closing the sale to PNE Enron has a 6 month Call option (thru 
6/30/01) to cash them out at the contract price (=$5.2MM less PV10 of accrued 
tax credits to date).  For the period of July 1-31, 2001 Fidelity would have 
a Put option at the same price.

This accomplishes the following:

Preserves $5MM cash for Enron by allowing us 6 months to find a new buyer for 
the tax credits and doing a back to back flip.
Preserves the integrity of the tax credits for cal 2001 (Gasco and Genco have 
to be unaffiliated) which will maximize our ability to recover our 
costs/minimize losses.
Gives Fidelity a date certain when they're out of the deal AND gives them 
optionality to stay in if they choose.
Gets the deal between Ecogas and PNE done structurally to PNE's satisfaction.

I spoke w/ Donahue about internal approvals and since Enron is already 
exposed for the $5.2MM, and the balance can only go down (not up), we didn't 
feel this would need anything other than ENA Legal and Office of the 
Chairman.  I'll assume this is correct unless I'm told otherwise.

I really hate to bother you with this, but anything you can do to get these 
guys off the dime and moving (rather than complaining) would be appreciated. 
I called Westfahl as you suggested, but he never responded. At the end of the 
day, I think maybe the board approval we were talking about (Moore, Florida 
and Louisiana) is the only way to send the message. 

One highlight of interest in Coleman's e-mail is that it takes longer than 7 
months to construct a 6 - LM6000 plant. That's pretty amazing given that 
NEPCO just finished constructing four ENA plants (Gleason, Wheatland, Wilton 
and Doyle) in less than 6 months.

Anything you can do (or any advice) would be appreciated. Right now I'm 
simply ignoring the negativism and proceeding as quickly as possible.

my concerns about the schedule issues.  You indicated that you had an idea 
that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 
months.  This is not at all realistic.  I would expect that the most 
aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired 
LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two 
weeks for each additional unit.  This would result in an installation 
duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.  In front 
of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work 
done.

The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling 
requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of 
this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental 
installation time per unit somewhat.  Considering these factors, it would not 
be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer.  

I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.  But I think 
that this is real world.  For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean 
getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. 

You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for 
Florida.  If this is correct then there is a serious disconnect for your 
schedule.  We need to make all efforts to expedite the on site date if June 
01 commercial operations is to be achieved.

Let's talk.

Mike

"Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas Sale","Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues 
for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call 
regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be 
worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you 
are doing the right thing.

Subject: Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas Sale

Dave,

We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.    
Kelemen is doing a great job.

In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has 
one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.  Without giving 
up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to 
position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their 
original bid.

Calpine - Pastoria
Early in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid 
primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, 
and their bid assumed  ""market"" for the turbines.   While they are correct 
(the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.  
There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not 
used between signing and closing.  Calpine also wanted to include other 
permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep 
that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and 
operate.  This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.  Our plan 
is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.  
The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the 
development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at 
risk.  This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs 
are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.  

AES - Pastoria
Same PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development 
risks (other than CEC).  They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, 
they want a more-involved transition team and  they want us to take more risk 
on post-signing/pre-closing development.  Their bid was $27million plus 
upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and 
schedule coordination services.  We have given them term sheets that provide 
for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 
per year of risk-free service revenues.  They have not yet responded.  By 
contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services 
or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).  

CEC Process:
On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), 
recommending approval of the Project.  By statute, this is one month early 
and the quickest in California to date.  This is a 400 page document and we 
are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original 
filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.  The stated 
process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which 
their is a 30 day appeal period.  If there is no appeal, the process is done 
Jan 19.  For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through 
the public hearing process.  While there was some intervention, our remote 
site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.  In 
order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that 
(i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.  In the 
past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was 
due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the 
law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk 
on the CEC permit getting appealed.  In Calpine's words, it would look pretty 
bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to 
Enron for nothing! 

AES-Las Vegas
They seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the 
QF.  They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.  
We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.  They 
have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, 
liability limits and the consortium EPC group.  They indicated that they have 
no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value 
of hitting June, 2002.  They want to meet with the EPC group and provide 
input to the notice to proceed.  Closing for them on this deal is a little 
cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as 
big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   
Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if 
they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on 
them for a week or so to try to get it closed.  

Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during 
the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.  Sometime 
before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings 
recognition.  We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about 
different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (iii) selling to 
Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.  As you can imagine, 
there are pros and cons to each approach.  We expect to know more on this by 
Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.

Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.  If 
they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to 
close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater 
the risk of missing June 2002 COD.  With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid 
results in a $6MM hit.  Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market 
valuation.  Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the 
hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's 
being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is 
accrual and being sold into Turbopark.  Like the Pastoria analysis, we will 
know more this week and will update you when we know.   


Regards,

Chris

Dave,

I would like to have a mid-year offsite with my group in late July.  I would 
like to include the associates and west CTG folks since they are a 
significant part of our team and we have a tremendous amount of work to do 
for the balance of the year.  We will keep costs reasonable by going to a 
resort that is driving distance from Portland.  Total cost is estimated at 
$23M.  We will have 1.5 days in conference and .5 days of activity (golf, 
etc.).  My assistant will send details to Kay.  Are you OK with this?

Chris

David -

Thank you for meeting with me yesterday, and discussing the Construction 
Exchange product concept.  I'm glad to hear that the Industrials Group  is 
already pursuing this type of project with their customers.  I look forward 
to their success, and believe this should bring significant value to Enron 
North America.

Thanks again for your time.

"Various","Kay please forward to Max Yzaguirre.

Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Delainey

Subject: 2001 Plan

I received the 2001 plan that Dave sent up here.  Chris and I talked and are 
working through all of the questions that Dave had.  I noticed that the gross 
margin plan for west power trading was $170 million.  When you were here I 
talked about $100 million total and then you talked me up to $120 million 
total with $100 from the trading efforts and $20 from middle 
market/services.  Why the change from $120 to $170?  Perhaps it was a 
typo?????  While I intend to make as much money as I possibly can next year, 
the $170 number seemed high.  Particularly given the regulatory freak show 
that is going down in California right now.

"Gas V@R","Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an 
interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would 
request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an 
additional two weeks starting today.

Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional 
permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta 
PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the 
winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.

"GE Plastics Facts","Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been 
sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed 
some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter 
or so.

Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the 
deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to 
closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some 
value for Enron to take this deal including:
 a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;
 b) $3 to $5 M in value;
 c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the 
large industrial customers;
 and d) provides an ""in"" to the GE family of companies which could result in 
significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Subject: GE Plastics Facts

Dave,

The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  

The obstacles to closure are:
- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
more
- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
- the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M

Deal Stats Are:

Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
O&M     $3   million/yr
Total     $20 million/yr

10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

Let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Rodney

Subject: An Associate who loves EA so much

Dear Mr Delainey:

We met in the Associate Orientation last summer when you asked me if I would 
like to join ENA for my first rotation. But since our first rotation was
assigned instead of chosen by ourselves, I was in no position to accept your 
kindly invitation. Now that I am two months away from finishing my
first rotation, I remembered our conversation during the Orientation and was 
more than eager to send you this  email hoping that your invitation is
still open.

I would love to join ENA (EA).  I believe by doing so, I will be given the 
opportunity to work with the smartest people in this industry.
I also believe I am prepared to join the trading unit in ENA.  I have five 
years' experience in Metals trading - both physical and financial. At
business school at UT Austin, I chose Energy Finance as my concentration and 
enjoyed tremendously these courses:

Risk management: Swap, Options, Delta and Vega hedge,...
Financial Strategy for Energy Companies: Financial decisions on investment 
and long-term hedge, ...
Financial Engineering: Case studies on financial products invented by 
Investment banks
Real Option Valuation: Decision making process considering the optionality in 
the future
Energy Law: Regulation and Environment issues in Energy Industry.

All this above and my passion for this industry and Enron  give me confidence 
to explore the opportunity to work in ENA. Only if you could
give me five minutes of your precious time to allow me to prove my 
qualifications, I will greatly appreciate it.

Have another  great year!


George Huan

as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Toronto Staffing Update

Dave...a brief update re Toronto. We have moved from 3 employees Jan 1, 2000 
to 13 employees. Recent hires are as follows:

1. Scott Gilbert (expat)   Manager  Volume Management
2. Chris Gaffney (from ENA)  Sr Counsel  Legal
3. Garrett Tripp (expat)   Manager  Power Trading
4. Jeff Borg (outside hire)  Director   Origination 
5. Steven Leung (from ENA)  Analyst   Origination
6. Dave Ellis (outside hire)  Manager  Volume Management
7. Dan Dorland (UofC grad)  Analyst   Origination
8. Lindsey Huculiak (outside hire) Admin Asst  General
9.Jahnet Theberge (oustside hire) Sr Admin Asst  General
10. Neil Stuchbury (outside hire)  Sr Specialist  Volume Management

As discussed, we have attempted to obtain a good mix of  ""Enron DNA"" and 
outside hires. We are currently in the process of hiring a marketer from Duke 
who covers eastern industrials on the gas side (John Guerriero, an engineer,  
background is UnionGas) and would like to target a couple of associates from 
Houston.  

Our national advertising campaign has finished its run and we received in 
excess of 350 resumes. We are currently reviewing the resumes and have 
scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday for June 24th in Toronto (Davies, Le 
Dain, Kitagawa, Devries, Dadson, McKay and myself will conduct the 
interviews).

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.

Regards,
Milnthorp

"Re: Devil's Tower","Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on 
this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have 
little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or 
collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group 
to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this 
increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.

"Edison Mission Energy","George, it is probably worth  speaking to them about the US assets - probably 
the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great 
brownfield sites. I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired 
assets. I would speak to Sherriff on that one. However, I would caution that 
real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on 
Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.  

For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based 
on gas being on the margin.  Now that was before a lot of the run up so it 
may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.  
As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not 
sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a 
Wall Street point of view.  

We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia 
assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's 
point of view..

Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger 
part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us 
from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view.  
Have we looked at this?  Are there many in the market?

Subject: Edison Mission Energy

Dave - as we know Mission is under pressure with regards to the poor 
performance of their non-regulated generation assets in the US and UK.  It 
appears their  UK coal fired assets (Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge) are for 
sale.  We should consider contacting them to determine their interest to 
divest any part of their US generation asset portfolio as well.

EME owns the former Comed coal and gas fired assets in Chicago, and Homer 
City in Pa.  In addition they have small coal fired generation assets in West

generation assets from Mission, and expand their existing capacity.

We are continuing to work on identifying brown field coal fired sites.  This 
may be another approach to pursue as well.

Dave --

Alstom ESCA is holding ""Summit 2000"" in Las Vegas Oct 16 - Oct 17.  The 
purpose of the meeting is to bring together people from throughout the 
industry to discuss key issues.  

Alstom ESCA is a French company that builds EMS systems in the US.  They 
developed the EMS for Enron's control areas.  We are working with them on 
Project e-trans (the RTO software).

The first panel in the am on Monday involves Re-regulation and Competition.  
They would like someone from Enron to present and participate.  Right now, 
they have  Pacificorp and are trying to get someone from government in PA and 
CA.  The presentation / speech is 10 - 15 minutes followed by 30 minutes of 
Q&A for the panel.

Do you have any interest in presenting?  This could be a good opportunity to 
deliver our message throughout the industry.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

As I mentioned to you earlier, there is much interest/concern about managing 
the ENE portfolio of turbines, both from a balance sheet and a deal 
perspective, as a result I've had numerous data requests in the last few 
weeks including one today from RAC.

I thought you might be interested in the comment I have highlighted below, in

Subject: Re: Master Turbine Listing  

Thanks Mike - the effort underway (by RAC and EECC) is an overall Enron 
turbine effort, to which the LM6000's are a subset.  Rick Buy must report to 
Skilling and the board on the ""long"" turbine position....... thus the current 
effort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be 
keeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with 
input from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we 
don't have redundant list efforts going.  

Matt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I 
think some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  
I will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  

Additionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using 
to track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are 
intended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  

Finally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the 
LM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure 
that Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were 
not listed).  

In summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so 
we can remove unneccessary work.  

Thanks for the note!  F.Kelly

Mike,

The Master Turbine Listing contains the schedules that Tammy Shepperd and I 
gathered together.
It includes an overal Turbine Inventory, Brian Hulse's LM6000 schedules and 
an LM6000 Timing page.
The LM6000 Configuration is Ben Jacoby's schedule.

As soon as Tammy and I set up the protection on the Master Turbine Schedule, 
I will send you its
location.

Thanks for all of your help and feedback,

Subject: Property Insurance Renewal 3/1/2001

Due to adverse loss experience the insurance market is ""hardening"" resulting 
in higher rates and more restrictive terms and conditions. Property insurance 
rates are generally rising for everyone and particularly those with poor loss 
experience. Unfortunately, Enron falls in the latter category. In the past, 
not withstanding our loss experience, Enron has enjoyed very competitive 
rates and a deductible of $500,000 for both property damage and business 
interruption (traditionally, property insurance policies contain a monetary 
deductible for property damage plus a day waiting period for business 
interruption (normally 30 to 90 days)).  For the period 1993 through 2000 
Enron paid premiums of approximately $114,100,000 and collected losses of 
approximately $ 212,200.000.  This trend is continuing under the current 
policy which is expiring on 3/1/2001. 

Current renewal terms being offered require an estimated premium of  
$17,000,000 and a deductible of $5,000,000 per loss for property damage and 
business interruption. This is the lowest deductible achievable unless we are 
willing to accept a waiting period for business interruption. 

Realising the potential costs and budgetary and contractual implications 
associated with such a change, we are continuing negotiations and seeking 
alternatives to the current renewal terms. However, we should all be prepared 
for an increase in premiums and the level of loss which we retain through 
deductibles. I will keep you advised as these negotiations progress. 

Please forward this notice to all concerned parties within your group. If 
there are any questions, please give me a call at ext. 36263.

Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information

would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing 
to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, 
although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay 
this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion

major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are 
standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough

On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My

Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have 
had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a 
better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and 
manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very 
solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then 
ultimately in origination.

I hope this helps.

Dave-

You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron 
are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal, 
commercial and credit implications of a deal.  What is the best way to obtain 
these skills?  Do you believe it is necessary or worthwhile to work a trading 
desk to truly understand how ENA functions?

Thanks,

Joe Short

Subject: Nigeria

A couple of points:

1) Dobler says that he has been in Nigeria for six months with no 
compensation and very poor communication.
2) The scope has changed from 3 barges to 9 barge.
3) His price quote is cost reimbursement plus $750,000/year for approximately 
thirteen years.  PV is between $5 and $6 million.
4) APACHI is having a severe case of sticker shock.
5) He insists this is market for a major international provider.

I need to understand your view as to whether we should price at market or 
does OEC have the mandate to be a ""support"" function for other Enron 
businesses (I assume the answer is NO)

Dave:

It is apparent that we are not going to reach agreement on an O&M contract 
that will be acceptable to third parties.  Given our clear intention to exit 
this project as fast as possible and extract our value through a promote, 
this leaves me no choice but to seek other alternatives.  I would appreciate 
your providing me interim O&M services until I can identify a third party 
service provider.  If you carry out your threat to abandon the assets, this 
will result in invalidation of our insurance coverage.  I hope you understand 
that this is not in anyone's interest.  I am disappointed to discover that 
our first experience with the new structure of O&M services is so 
unsatisfactory.

"PRC","I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

Subject: Goldendale Turbine

Dave,

In going through the turbine list over the last few days, EE&CC's, Sumas II- 
Goldendale (GE 7FA, Jun '01 delivery) turbine keeps popping up.  ENA could 
trade this turbine to several parties (Tenaska, Indeck) to get a lock on a QF 
restructuring.  Also, Sumas I still has restructruring value that EE&CC did 
not get a lock on in exchange for the EPC/turbine contract. 

As I recall, Larry Izzo promised to replace the GE 7FA turbine with a 
comparable machine with a Q4-2001 delivery date.  While the Goldendale EPC 
contract may executed and there may be nothing to do, there is significant 
value sitting on the table.  If we cannot get the Goldendale 7FA back, then 
can we enforce the replacement provision that was promised (as I remember) as 
part of your original deal with Larry Izzo?  I realize that at this point the 
politics may prevent us from doing anything.  However, I at least want to get 
you thinking about it just in case there was a way to get a turbine to trade 
for larger value than an EPC contract for EE&CC.

Regards,

Mike J. Miller

This NY cap proposal must be prevented.   The proposal is essentially 
cost-based regulation.   Obviously, if the proposal below was adopted by NY, 
Enron's ability to make money is greatly diminished.   In addition, it has 
significant effects on the rest of the market in terms of regulatory 
uncertainty in the forward markets.

In the past, FERC has ruled to make caps consistent in all 3 NE regions (NY, 
NE, and PJM), which leads to quasi caps in the rest of the Eastern 
Interconnect.

Jim,
We need an action plan ASAP.   Please coordinate with Dana, Tom May, and 
myself.

FYI.  In the interest of all the developing markets, I think that we need to

Subject: NYPSC Interim Pricing Report on ISO

Earlier today, the New York Public Service Commission released a 122 page 
draft report prepared by its staff evaluating the NYISO. The report concludes 
that the ISO must pursue a wide range of operational reforms and other 
consumer safeguards to ""ensure a more efficient and stable electric market 
that will better protect consumers from dramatic price increases."" The report 
culminates a months-long investigation begun by the PSC last summer in 
response to problems and price run-ups in the wholesale market.

The major recommendations in the Report, some of which have already surfaced 
in recent ISO Committee meetings, would be devastating to a competitive 
wholesale market and would largely reregulate prices in New York. They 
include the following (taken directly from the PSC's Press Release):

Reforming rules and procedures to improve the efficiency of the market and 
minimize opportunities for market manipulation, or ""gaming,"" by owners of 
electricity generating facilities;
Initiating a $150 per megawatt hour price cap on generators to maintain 
reasonable market clearing prices;
Creating a ""circuit-breaker"" mechanism that will prevent market power abuses 
at levels below $150/MWH;
Lowering price thresholds significantly to allow the NYISO to step in more 
quickly to investigate and mitigate price spikes;
Granting the NYISO retroactive refund authority to return to consumers gains 
that generators improperly derive from market power abuse; and,
Creating a strong deterrent against price abuses by penalizing generators who 
repeatedly use improper tactics to raise prices above competitive levels.

The NYPSC, of course, has no legal authority to impose any of these 
recommendations. However, they are likely to muster support from the 
Transmission Owners, governmental entities and loads, that usually control 
enough votes to just  pass a motion at an ISO Committee. This will set up a 
confrontation with the ISO Board, which is walking a delicate tightrope 
between maintaining its independence and supporting a competitive wholesale 
market on the one hand, and dealing with the politics of a hostile 
Administration in New York. Last summer, as you may recall, the Board 
rejected the $1000 bid cap pushed through by the PSC, voting instead for a 
$1300 cap. That action was set aside by FERC, which reimposed the $1,000 
level and then made it applicable in New England as well so that there would 
be consistency among the three Northeast ISOs (PJM already had the $1,000 
cap.) 

Thus, whether NY follows the lead of California is likely to be determined by 
FERC, and it will have to carefully consider the consistency concerns it 
raised last summer in ultimately deciding whether it's OK for New York to set 
price caps below its neighboring ISOs.

Attached is a copy of the PSC's Press Release and Report.

"Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals","Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.

We have closed the following deals where we deliver power two a muni in the 
short term and get paid back power later on.  These deals have both a 
commodity and a finance portion:

Counterparty    Loan Period  Repayment Period  Amount Financed

Grant County    7/01 to 7/06   7/06   $4.7 million
Grant County    5/01 to 7/06   7/06   $5.7 million

Clatskanie    11/2000 to 9/2001 10/2001 to 9/2006  $5 million
Eugene Water and Electric  1/2001 to 3/2002  11/2001 to 4/2002  $4.9 million
Eugene Water and Electric  7/2001 to 12/2002 5/2002 to 12/2002  $7.3 million

We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is 
looking at $35,000,000 + in this type of structure.  What do you guys need to 
know about this business and how much of an appetite do we have for this?

At Dave Duran's request I have attached for your information two files 
containing a term sheet from El Paso reflecting the final terms as negotiated 
and a spreadsheet analysis of the valuation of that offer ($206.6mm).  The 
offer analysis uses a discount rate on the El Paso Deferred and Scheduled 
Payments of 8.25%.  This rate is the middle of the range of a recent quote 
from Treasury/RAC as to the expected rate at which we will be able to 
monetize this payment stream.  The Contingent Payments are in the form of a 
residual preferred partnership interest that we will retain and are 
discounted at the current project rate with a probability adjustment.  The 
residual partnership interest should allow us to fair value these contingent 
payments (as we are currently doing on the existing contingent payments) and 
should also be beneficial to the tax structure of the transaction.

Subject: Enron Direct Canada-First Deal

Harold;

We have today closed our first retail transaction that is a five year 
exclusive gas supply arrangement with Boardwalk Equities, the largest 
apartment building owner in Alberta.  We will be serving 20,000 apartment 
suites with an annual consumption of 1.5 bcf.  The 5 year margin will be 
approximately $1.5 million.  As a result of our direct instructions, 
Boardwalk lobbied the government to provide them with $2.8 million dollars in 
rebates over the next 4 months to shield them from the higher gas prices.  
These rebates will be paid through Enron Direct as the retailer for Boardwalk.

The gas begins flow on March 1.  We are working on other large building 
owners and restaurant chains and expect to close 2 or 3 more deals for flow 
of March 1. Cadillac Fairview is committed to working with us on a gas 
contract within the next 2 weeks.   We now have a strong platform to grow 
quickly, from a standing start one month ago.

Although the government effectively delayed the opening of the retail power 
market for one year through a price cap, we have been able to grasp a first 
mover advantage on retailing natural gas in Alberta.  We expect to have a 
strong retail delivery organization built by mid year, with 35 staff managing 
a significant number of commercial customers.

The current pricing environment creates a large opportunity to sell 5 year 
fixed price product with significant margins.  Atco, the gas utility is 
getting bad press for not offering hedging instruments, and are cooperating 
with us to assist us in getting established as a retailer.  

This has been a very large effort in the last month, as we needed to get 
licensed, and get legal agreements in place where there were no precedents to 
look at.  We are excited at the prospects for a substantial business 
developing very quickly here in Alberta.  The Enron Canada analytical, risk 
management, regulatory and legal staff have provided great assistance to 
allow us to execute this transaction in a short period.

Regards.

Dave

Subject: Re: PGE's '02 and beyond

Hi, Mitch!  As of today, Oregon is sill moving forward with our version of
open access.  As you may recall, this is a fairly consevative approach.  Only
non-residential customers are eligible for direct access.  Utilities need not
sell any generating resources.  We will use a technique called ""ongoing
valuation"" to allow non-residentials to elect other suppliers while still
receiving the benefits/paying the costs of our current supplies.  We are
planning to be in balance (or long) for 2002 on a full load basis.  Thus,
while non-residential customers may elect new suppliers, they are essentially
fully hedged with our portfolio of long- and short-term supplies.  We have
also begun to raise the question for discussion whether we should fill a full
load position for years beyond 2002.  Those discussions will probably continue
the next couple of months.  One possible outcome is that we would fill all of
our load except perhaps customers over 1-5 MWs.  They would have the right to
""opt-out"" by giving us notice 1/1/02 not to plan for them beginning 1/1/03. 
Then, the Commission might phase in this option for consecutively smaller load
customers on a set schedule.  This would allow us some certainty and ability
to make longer-term commitments and also give the market some certainty about
what load might be available when.  Everyone is well-aware of our short
position and the implications of that.  We are seeking an amendment to
Oregon's restructuring law that would eliminate any date restriction on our
ability to treat resource commitments as eligible for transition treatment.  I
think this is a critical piece to ensuring that Oregon doesn't set up a cliff
like California did or Nevada appears to be doing.  All this being said,
whether Oregon's restructuring moves forward is ultimately an
emotional/political issue.  Bad news, even if unrelated to direct access,
could spook the Legislature enough to give momentum to the several bills
already introduced to delay/reverse it.  We will keep you informed. 
Meanwhile, our power supply folks are proceeding as if we will need to plan
for almost everyone indefinitely.

>>> Jim Piro 01/26/01 02:26PM >>>
I think based upon your discussions with staff and the commissioners you are
the best one to respond to this question.  Thanks

>>> <Mitchell.Taylor@enron.com> 1/26/01 8:49:09 AM >>> 
Jim, 

In the resource plan that you sent me earlier this week, you indicated that 
PGE was short anywhere from 400 to 700 MW, going out to 2006. What 
sentiment are you hearing in Oregon about open accesss? (In Nevada, where 
I have been focused of late, the drums are beating louder for longer 
delays). If open access (customer choice) is deferred beyond this year, 
how do you plan to cover this short position, especially in '02? Does the 
OPUC appreciate that you are short in anticipation of open access? 

Thanks, 

Mitch

"Tembec and US Originators","Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is 
similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:

 a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the 
paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;
 b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no 
outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron 
Mexico; 
 c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I 
would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in 
which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work 
together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding 
outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC 
and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico 
coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in 
Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to 
clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people 
and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer 
(ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the 
sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and 
execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am 
expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for 
Canada and Mexico;
 and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at 
this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and 
if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to 
ECC.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I 
thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My 
understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:

1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and 
Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian 
Facilities.

2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.

3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & 
Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all 
other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs 
to be co-ordinated.

Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to 
talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC 
has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US 
facilities.

It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to 
get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the 
interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing 
arrangement.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and 
energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about 
the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the 
Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian 
companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps 
and to some extent, new SPV's.

In this instance,

1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company
2.  All their assets are in Canada
3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility
4.  We know the executive team at Tembec
5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy 
market which is their focus right now
6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement 
similar to the US pitches

With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up 
here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and 
hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying 
that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to 
her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and 
knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the 
technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team 
put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.  
However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this 
office!!!

I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the 
meeting and deliver the ""Enron"" message, but going forward we need to have 
this resolved.


Cheers, Paul D

Dave,

I have taken the ""communicate your ideas to the right person"" to heart.  One 
of the main reasons I came to Enron was to help expand it marketing efforts.  
I have taken a few minutes to write my idea, because verbal ideas can get 
lost in the shuffle.  I feel strongly about this opportunity and this notion 
is what attracted me back to the Big E.  I believe all the pieces of this 
idea are present at Enron, but we can maximize our resources.

Subject: Emissions - Mass. power plants

E&E Newsline - May 11, 2000

MASSACHUSETTS POWER PLANTS AGREE TO SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES

     Massachusetts this week announced that its six highest-polluting
power plants will voluntarily upgrade their pollution control technology to
not only significantly reduce air pollution but to also put the old
facilities under the same standards as new facilities.

     The action makes Massachusetts the first state to require older
plants to meet the same emissions standards as new facilities. The reduced
emissions will be in place as soon as 2003, according to Massachusetts
Governor Paul Cellucci's (R) office.

     The state approached the six plants and asked them to either reduce
their emissions or face regulatory action by the Department of
Environmental Protection. Cellucci said, ""We challenged these power plants
to clean up their act, and they have answered our call to meet the most
comprehensive air emissions standards in the United States.""

     The agreement -- which the five operators of the six plants agreed
to with the state -- is voluntary, but enforceable rules will follow.

     Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift explained that the agreement
resulted through ""cooperative efforts,"" but added, ""We will pursue new
regulations through the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure
the plant owners' commitments are enforceable, and will require the
finalization of a detailed plan for each of the six facilities.""

     The regulations, which are expected to be proposed in the next few
months -- will set standards of 1.5 ponds of nitrogen oxide and 3 pounds of
sulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour.

     The five companies -- including Sithe Energies, Inc., NRG Energy
Inc., PE&E, Western Massachusetts Electric Companies/ Northeast Utilities,
and Southern Company/Southern Energy New England, LLC -- have submitted
preliminary plans. Under the plans, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions would be slashed by up to 50 percent, and mercury, particulate
and carbon dioxide pollution would be curbed.

     ""Our Air Quality Improvement Plan demonstrates that environmental
excellence works in today's competitive market,"" said James McGowan, senior
vice president of Sithe. ""This is a win-win program that will produce the
best power plant for Sithe, the local communities and the environment as a
whole.""

     The statement counters many other utilities' position on the issue,
particularly the Midwestern coal-fired plants subject to a massive EPA
enforcement action initiated late last year to have the facilities use
upgraded pollution control technology. Specifically, the lawsuit charges
the utilities with noncompliance with New Source Review requirements of the
Clean Air Act.

     The Massachusetts situation ""does undercut the arguments of
dirtier, Midwestern companies that claim it can't be done,"" said Frank
O'Donnell, with Clean Air Trust.

     Pat Hemlepp, spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of the
utilities involved in the EPA lawsuit, argued, however, ""that is like
comparing apples to oranges.""

     Though Northeastern states blame the Midwest for pollution
migrating in their air, Hemlepp explained that since there are no serious
problems with non-attainment with CAA regulation in the Midwest, stricter
controls on utilities operating in that part of the country are
unnecessary. ""States like Massachusetts have every right to go in and ask
utilities within their state to upgrade. There are major non-attainment
problems in the Northeast, so it makes sense,"" Hemlepp argued.

     And about EPA's lawsuit, ""What people overlook is that EPA's
lawsuit is not about emissions, it's about what is and isn't legal under
the Clean Air Act. ... We feel very strongly that what we've done is
legal,"" Hemlepp said.

"Re: Internal Markets","Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I 
think it works welll in allocating resources between competing ""going 
concerns"" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses 
that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the 
cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than 
the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often 
clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly 
effectively.

Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of 
time on this.

Delainey

I know we just completed a deal with Cinergy, but I have another idea for us 
to kick around with these guys.  They are building 1,000 MWs, very efficient, 
coal facility along the Ohio river.  Talking with Ben Jacoby and Fred Mitro I 
found out that we are looking at either building a coal facility or investing 
in one, which would create a great hedge against gas.  I am beginning to go 
through the information that Ben and Fred have put together and I wanted to 
sign up a CA with Cinergy regarding this issue.  I was planning on running 
with this, but wanted to make sure this was the type of investment that we 
might be interested in.  I think a partnership in coal with Cinergy could be 
a great partnership for us.  I hope this idea is what you had in mind.  
Thanks in advance for your time.

Further to Dave's note (below), I indicated to you at the offsite our team 
had screened the No. American names which we felt were appropriate for the 
energy services/outsourcing product (ENA NAIC industry codes, large energy 
spend, multi-sites, consume/produce commodities in which we make a market, 
limited credit capacity, etc).  Naturally, the list includes numerous Mexican 
and Canadian firms which fell out of the screen.  These firms are as follows:

As you are undoubtedly more familiar with these firms, you may, or may not, 
think these companies work for the product (we have not tested the 
assumption) but can offer some joint marketing support.  Many of these firms 
have sites accross the continent and it is important to portfolio effect 
their assets to make the transaction work.  We have done  dozens of 
presentations and would propose we put our heads together to determine if 
there is a business opportunity in your market.  

Let me know what you think of the list and which approach makes most sense 
for you.  Jim

PS, via separate e-mail I will forward examples of the presentations we have 
used.

"Las Vegas CoGen","Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position 
in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA 
could create significant value from a project that we have very little 
invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone 
and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, 
as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will 
argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to 
maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant 
dollars or taking significant risks.

Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.

Thanks for the quick response, Joe.  Peter did call me earlier this

to get his phone number before transferring him, but I understand from Dave's 
assistant that he left Dave a voicemail.  I'm sure he left his number there.  
I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 
buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and 
have +/- 100 additional properties they manage.

I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything 
further you need me to do.  Good luck - I hope it's a real deal - I've never 
had origination next to my name before!  SRS

Sherri,

We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently 
working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract 
terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to 
EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some 
real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide 
power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of 
other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off 
balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case 
we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence.

Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a 
particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our 
biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us.

Gentlemen,

You will receive a phone call from Peter Wachtell sometime over the next 
week.  I spoke to his father last night at a dinner party; Peter is putting 
together a deal in Tokyo right now to purchase 50 office buildings and manage 
another 100.  He is interested in talking to Enron about energy outsourcing.

I'm assured that this a legitimate deal, but that will be for you to decide!  
Just wanted to give you a heads up in the hopes you will take a few minutes 
to talk to him.

Subject: Change to the Inga DASH

The Approval Amount for the Inga DASH has been revised from $98 million to 
$105.25 million to accomodate the potential requirement of having to replace 
existing credit support facilities provided by the seller, A. Ahlstrom, or 
the target, Ahlstrom Development Corporation (""ADC"").  Although not explicit, 
this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain 
""change-in-ownership"" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete 
Enron's acquisition of ADC.  As we believe that the liklihood of this 
requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH 
reflects the aggregate of these amounts.  The requirement with regard to 3) 
below lies with an ADC subsidiary and should not ""reasonably"" merit 
replacement by Enron.

This change was reflected in the DASH mailed to the Finance Committee of the 
BoD on 12/05/00.

The potential credit support facilities are detailed as follows:

1)  Panther Creek -- A. Ahlstrom Comfort Letter:  A. Ahlstrom provided a  
""comfort letter"" for the benefit of the lenders at the Panther Creek 
project.  Upon acquisition by Enron, the beneficiaries of this comfort letter 
may require that it be replaced by an ENE guaranty.  The comfort letter 
requires A. Ahlstrom to provide up to $1.5 MM in additional equity to the 
project in the event that the project cannot meet its debt service.

Based on the origination team's analysis, the likelihood of an equity call 
related to the comfort letter appears to be minimal given:  
the project  is projected to achieve an average 1.92x debt service coverage 
ratio in the pro forma model
the partnership maintains business interruption insurance
the project can subordinate $2MM in O&M incentive payments annually to meet 
its debt service targets

2)  Panther Creek -- Equity Support Agreements:  ADC, as well the other major 
partner, Constellation, have provided guarantees in favor of the Panther 
Creek project lenders, each with a maximum exposure of $5.75 MM  Equity 
support under this agreement may be called on if the Panther Creek project 
does not meet its debt service requirements.  We believe that these 
obligations should be maintained by ADC and not up-streamed to Enron as Enron 
obligations, however, the consenting parties may disagree.

In the event that Enron is required to provide this support in exchange for 
consent, the origination team believes it is unlikely that the project 
lenders will call on the equity support agreements due to the coverage ratio, 
insurance and payment subordination items discussed above under item 1) above.

3)  Gilberton -- Capital Support Agreement:  Orion Power Company (a 
subsidiary of ADC) has committed to providing a maximum of $1.25 MM in equity 
support to the Gilberton Power Project, in the event that debt service cannot 
be met.  We have not provided for this in the DASH as we believe that these 
obligation should be maintained by Orion and not upstreamed to either ADC or 
Enron as either an ADC or Enron obligation.

The origination team believes that if Enron is called upon to provide this 
credit support, the impact of such would be minimal because:
the agreement expires once project debt is repaid in Dec 2002
the project maintains a cash debt service reserve of $16 MM (and only $32 MM 
of debt reamains outstanding)
pro forma debt service coverage ratios average 1.53x against a target of 1.15x

Given there is minimal expectation the facilities will be drawn upon, RAC 
does not foresee a material impact on the overall project economics.  To the 
extent guarantees or letters of credit are issued, an appropriate cost for 
these guarantees should be deducted from the value of the transaction.

Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to this change.

Regards,

My idea would be to confirm that appropriate due diligence has been done. Has 
the mid-year performance evaluation been reviewed? Has his two direct 
supervisors been contacted (Ozzie Pagan and Gil Muhl) for specific input into 
this? Once all this has been confirmed and everyone has agreed, you should 
make a decision to either re-deploy him to another area or offer him a 
severence package. 

My recommendation would be to have him in a coverage role in Southeast gas.

Subject: Recruiting/Sponsorship at Ivey

Dave,

I understand that you are also a former UWO grad (please correct me if this 
is incorrect).

Are you involved in the decisions to recruit or provide sponsorship at Ivey?

The reason I ask is that the LEADER Project at Ivey is in need of a new lead 
sponsor and given the new developments in Ontario and Alberta with dereg, 
this may be a great opportunity to get Enron's name out in the business 
community.

I was very involved with the LEADER Project when I was at Ivey as one of the 
Executive Directors and oversaw general operations as well as the Western 
Region (i.e. Ukraine and Belarus).  While Enron may not have specific 
interests to promote in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, or Kazakstan, LEADER is a 
very large and well respected project within the school and amongst the 
alumni.   I have already made a $250 personal donation to the project and 
would love to see a greater presence of Enron (Houston) on campus.

I know that this is a busy time of year but perhaps you can consider the idea 
and we can discuss its potential in the new year.

Thanks in advance,

Bill Heidecker

Subject: PSCO

Dave,

Wanted to give you a heads up...

We are looking at a DASH for approximately $1.5MM for development of PSCO.  
This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft 
engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air 
permit).  The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the 
entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach 
given his understanding of the project risks and economics.  

The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -> Turbo Park  
with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 2001.  there is likely a 
need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 
through Jan 31.

We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient 
conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if 
there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, 
fuel).  In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated 
and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).  We will have a 
definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.  I spoke  with 
Jacoby and  Janet and told them we are planning to take the remaining two 
LM6000's for this project.

I am available to talk about it at your convenience.

Regards,

Chris

Subject: PSCO

Chip,

PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating 
points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 
6-LM6000 project with a June 2001 start date.  The additional two LM6000's 
materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m 
decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) 
with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language 
drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.

In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional 
equipment through West LB ASAP:

6 stacks  $1,188,000
3 Control Modules $375,000
1 CEMS  $675,000
4 230kv Breakers $340,000
Total:   $2,578,000

The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  
More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are 
minimal as follows:

Now through November 1:    $257,800
Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)

Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:

EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:  $175,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000

Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board 
approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment 
orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development 
project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount 
might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering 
costs.  That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more 
complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec 
Committe meeting in November.

How does this sound to you?

Regards,

Chris

Subject: Elektrobolt DASH - EE&CC Questions/Comments

Larry:

Rick Buy has asked that I respond to you directly on your concerns outlined 
in your memo this morning:

1.  With respect to EPC price, the range in the DASH text indicates EPC Price 
range reported to us by the deal team without the contingency.   Dan Leff has 
changed the DASH to reflect a range with the $10 million contingency.  For 
modelling purposes, we have used the following aggregated values in our 
probabilistic evaluation to account for the EPC Contract Price and a $10 
million hard cost contingency:

   ($000s)
P5   $194.25
P50 (expected)  $210.00    
P95   $225.75

2.  With regard to schedule, I am told that EE&CC has a copy of the 
Consortium Agreement where this information is contained.  I retrieved this 
information from that document.  I have attached a copy of the Consortium 
Agreement.  I hear your points and understand the risk.  The schedule will be 
driven by receipt of the necessary permits.  If the permitting process does 
not proceed as expected, I recommend that EWS/Americas Management reconsider 
the incremental investment in the project.  On-going dialogue between 
EWS/Americas and EE&CC will be essential in determining the continued 
viability of the schedule.  Enron owns 25% of CEG and does not have 
control--I would recommend that we consult with Enron legal on this question.



3.  It is prudent to restrict expenditures to $15 million until we receive 
our permits given this is the maximum recoverable amount from Petrobras.  
From a permitting perspective, we are unable to commence construction of the 
plant beyond site clearance without the actual environmental and installation 
permits anyway, so whether or not we place a $15 million constraint on 
expenditure, the absence of permits will not allow for further construction.  
An issue comes along with respect to long-lead items and whether these should 
be ordered in advance of permit issuance.  Our understanding is that the $15 
million figure was derived with the assistance of EE&CC and takes into 
consideration funding required for long-lead items.

4.  The 9169 btu/kwh is assumed to be LHV in the model.

5.  The Consortium Agreement anticipates a 92% availability for maximum 
payout of the capacity payment.  The capacity payment is discounted ratably 
to the extent the Equivalent Availability Factor is less than 92% as per 
Schedule 8.06 in the Consortium Agreement.

With regard to future co-ordination, please designate an individual to be 
placed on the circulation for all DASHs in the future.  I will ensure that a 
DASH is provided within a time frame appropriate for response and discussion.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,

Chip

To: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT (AKA ""ELECTROBOLT"")

Rick, I was provided a copy of the DASH at 6:30 PM last evening and asked to 
sign off soonest.  My comments follow:

Cost:  the DASH is incorrect.  EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and 
a guaranteed price.
EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM.
EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.  
We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.  Since last week, 
the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.  It is unlikely that 
the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.  
$202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of 
overruns and schedule.  This would require the Owner to maintain a 
contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM.
After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was 
going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this 
estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the 
numbers I saw last week.
Schedule:  Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by 
Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.  The ability of 
Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 2002 if the project is not completed due 
to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not 
totally impossible.  Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 2002, 
termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force 
majeure.  This is considered more of an onerous risk.  It's not clear to me 
whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project 
would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a 
partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company.
On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 2001 start-up, is 
reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.  
If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to 
$15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk.
Performance:  The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site 
condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears 
correct, if it is LHV.
O&M Guarantee:  The DASH is not clear on what O&M availability guarantee 
Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.  I would suggest that OEC insure it 
agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras 
agreement.

Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the 
RAC needs improvement.  In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide 
to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma 
against the PPA.  This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of 
experience.  The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.  I 
suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.

Regards,

Larry

Subject: Catalytica

Catalytica filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC yesterday, December 
11th which disclosed that because of recent market conditions the Board had 
decided not to proceed with the planned stock split prior to the spin-off.  
The supplement indicates an expected initial trading range ""at a price 
between $20 and no less than $10 per share"".   Based upon these new 
Catalytica's estimates, the value of the Enron investment would be $13.5 to 
$27.0 million.  Enron's Catalytica investment is part of the raptor structure 
so that the impact is on raptor capacity rather than earnings.  The 
investment has also been monetized in a FAS 125 structure for cash flow 
purposes.

Dave,

Here is PGE's response to the question you raised about how its plans to 
cover its short position in '02 and beyond.  Part of Pamela's response does 
not make sense to me and I will follow up with her for additional details.

Let me know if you have additional questions.

Subject: Re: PGE's '02 and beyond

Hi, Mitch!  As of today, Oregon is sill moving forward with our version of
open access.  As you may recall, this is a fairly consevative approach.  Only
non-residential customers are eligible for direct access.  Utilities need not
sell any generating resources.  We will use a technique called ""ongoing
valuation"" to allow non-residentials to elect other suppliers while still
receiving the benefits/paying the costs of our current supplies.  We are
planning to be in balance (or long) for 2002 on a full load basis.  Thus,
while non-residential customers may elect new suppliers, they are essentially
fully hedged with our portfolio of long- and short-term supplies.  We have
also begun to raise the question for discussion whether we should fill a full
load position for years beyond 2002.  Those discussions will probably continue
the next couple of months.  One possible outcome is that we would fill all of
our load except perhaps customers over 1-5 MWs.  They would have the right to
""opt-out"" by giving us notice 1/1/02 not to plan for them beginning 1/1/03. 
Then, the Commission might phase in this option for consecutively smaller load
customers on a set schedule.  This would allow us some certainty and ability
to make longer-term commitments and also give the market some certainty about
what load might be available when.  Everyone is well-aware of our short
position and the implications of that.  We are seeking an amendment to
Oregon's restructuring law that would eliminate any date restriction on our
ability to treat resource commitments as eligible for transition treatment.  I
think this is a critical piece to ensuring that Oregon doesn't set up a cliff
like California did or Nevada appears to be doing.  All this being said,
whether Oregon's restructuring moves forward is ultimately an
emotional/political issue.  Bad news, even if unrelated to direct access,
could spook the Legislature enough to give momentum to the several bills
already introduced to delay/reverse it.  We will keep you informed. 
Meanwhile, our power supply folks are proceeding as if we will need to plan
for almost everyone indefinitely.

>>> Jim Piro 01/26/01 02:26PM >>>
I think based upon your discussions with staff and the commissioners you are
the best one to respond to this question.  Thanks

>>> <Mitchell.Taylor@enron.com> 1/26/01 8:49:09 AM >>> 
Jim, 

In the resource plan that you sent me earlier this week, you indicated that 
PGE was short anywhere from 400 to 700 MW, going out to 2006. What 
sentiment are you hearing in Oregon about open accesss? (In Nevada, where 
I have been focused of late, the drums are beating louder for longer 
delays). If open access (customer choice) is deferred beyond this year, 
how do you plan to cover this short position, especially in '02? Does the 
OPUC appreciate that you are short in anticipation of open access? 

Thanks, 

Mitch

Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective 
communication tool.  

I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our 
settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of 
communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I 
have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the 
larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm 
pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have 
suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both 
TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are 
going.  

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

Dave Delainey

Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on 
whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale 
businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.  
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this 
needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the

Enron will take the initiative and help IEP jump-start the PR effort by the 
end of the week.  I spoke with Smutney this evening.  He likes the idea of 
Enron taking the lead with McNally/Temple.  I've emailed him the one-pager we 
worked up today.--Palmer, Steffes, Dasovich,Parquet
The urgency for a solution is growing and a vaccuum has formed, with many 
trying to fill the void.  The Cal. Manufacturers Ass. has called a meeting 
with IEP and the utilities.  Dave Parquet and Doug Condon will attend.
I spoke with the VP of Strategic Planning at the ISO today who said there is 
a ""98% chance"" that price caps will be on the agenda at the August ISO Board 
meeting.
Dave Parquet continues to check with SDG&E to determine when SDG&E plans to 
make an announcement about what it intends to do with the offers it received 
last week.
Dave Parquet is working with Andy Kellerman and J. Steffes to try and get the 
investment community energized on this issue.
The issue is now apparently affecting California legislative races.  Staffers 
are drafting a bill that an ""at risk"" Democrat Senator from San Diego will 
carry, with the hope of using the bill to get the bump necessary to win the 
election.  Mona will meet with the staffer on Thursday to find out what he 
has in mind for the bill and to communicate our views.
Dasovich will meet with Commissioner Bilas Wednesday to see if the Republican 
block of the California PUC is hanging tough.

That's it from our end.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and I need 
to know if you want Breslau.  I would like him in a singular role and 
accountability so I need to plan to incorporate him or not depending on if 
you want him.

Delainey

I do not think ENA should cover the IDC's prior to us taking this turbine. It 
would be appropriate for us to pick up IDC's going forward. Your thoughts?

Janet:

Did you happen to talk to Dave about whether his agreement on the 501D5A 
included taking the IDCs? FYI, they total about $2.5 million. As I mentioned, 
CALME wants to move the turbine off their books as soon as possible. Based on 
our conversation on Friday, I have told Jody that we will not accept the $1.2 
million they paid in error to Siemens Westinghouse, and that I was checking 
on our position on the IDCs. Please let me know what your and Dave's position 
is on this.

damage until the unit is boroscoped tomorrow.  

Units 2 & 3:  Will be back in commercial operation tomorrow.  The team is

Subject: Re: Gleason Blade Ring Schedule  

Mark,

We have been working diligently with Westinghouse to get a schedule for the 
removal and modification of the blade rings at Gleason.  I requested 
Westinghouse begin to prepare for this work on Sunday after you confirmed 
that we could no longer tolerate the operating restriction being added to the 
unit.  Based on discussions with Westinghouse on Sunday, we estimated that 
the work could be completed in 14 days.  The site began disassembly of unit 
#2 on Monday.  Unit #1 disassembly began on Tuesday because we had to wait 
for the unit to cool down.  

The first verbal schedule from Westinghouse was received Monday night.  It 
showed the blade rings being machined in series at a single shop and resulted 
in the lasy unit being delayed about 4 days.  I told Westinghouse this would 
not be acceptable and that the blade rings needed to be machined in 
parallel.  Westinghouse agreed and has made a second shop available.  Another 
schedule was published yesterday afternoon that required an additional step 
in the disassembly that I felt was not required and added a day to the 
duration.  Westinghouse suggested that we remove the compressor blades from 
the rotor before we remove the blade rings.  I have since concluded that 
removing the rotor blades first is in fact the correct procedure. 

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, this schedule for the blade 
rings, which has been at the site since last night,  will be distributed to 
everyone today.  In addition, the site will incorporate the remaining startup 
activities and issue an integrated schedule tonight.

As we discussed at the meeting this morning, it is very unlikely that Gleason 
#1 and #2 can be available by June 1.  Our optimistic estimate from the 
meeting this morning was June 4-7.

Gavin

Subject: Gleason Blade Ring Schedule

John/Gavin -

We have made progress over the last week in getting GE attention focused on 
the emissions problems at Lincoln.  After 6 days of daily conferences on the 
subject, GE has arrived in force at Lincoln, with the personnel and resources 
required to address the problem.  We are not out of the woods yet, but I 
believe everything is now being done that can be done to get as many machines 
available as possible by June 1.

Enron needs the same focus from Westinghouse, on  issues currently plagueing 
Wheatland and Gleason.  Unlike Lincoln, where the machines are capable of 
producing MW's, these two sites have units that cannot operate.  Namely, 
vibration issues on units 1 and 2 at Wheatland and compressor blade ring 
issues on units 1 and 2 at Gleason.

ENA has been requesting since Monday this week, a definitve and complete 
schedule from EECC, showing the disassembly, shipping, machining, reassembly 
and testing of units 1 and 2 blade rings at Gleason.  We still do not have 
this schedule.  Furthermore, it would appear that after this morning's 
meeting, there is some confusion on what work actually needs to be performed 
in order to accomplish this task and what impact that may have on the 14-day 
schedule committed to ENA by Gavin Gaul on 5/15.  I am not sure whether the 
communication breakdown is between business units at Westinghouse or between 
Enron and Westinghouse, but a schedule and plan is the first step towards 
getting the work done and we are two days into the work.  I am expecting this 
plan to be circulated today.

Lastly, although we have been verbally assured by Westinghouse that there 
will be no operating restrictions, other than routine borescope inspections 
during off-peak periods, OEC would be more comfortable getting this in 
writing.  We are requesting a formal notice from Westinghouse, identifying 
any operational restrictions (post-blade ring repair) on these units.

If there is any assistance you require, please do not hesitate to request 
it.  We collectively have 14 days to declare all 15 units ready for 
commercial operation.

Dave,

Can you please confirm to Wes that you agreed to add $1.2MM to the transfer 
price for the two GE 7EA turbines to compensate EECC for the cancellation 
cost we took on the Westinghouse unit?  Thanks.

"Assets and Trading","Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE 
and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by 
Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run 
will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to 
move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect 
their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing 
sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily 
be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will 
realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.

It is not a bad model just a different one.

Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall 
Street.

management considers what businesses Newco should include.  This article 
suggests that a combination of physical assets and trading are best.  That

Analyst: Koch Venture Adds Value To Entergy-FPL Merger
By Bryan Lee
  
08/10/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The trading venture between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and 
Koch Industries will get a big boost from the utility's planned merger with 
FPL Group (FPL), marrying trading floor expertise with a commanding array of 
power plant assets.

So says Diane Borska, director of the utilities and energy practice at 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Fuld Inc., a consulting firm specializing in 
""competitive intelligence."" 
In April, Entergy and Koch formed a joint venture to trade electricity and 
natural gas. 

The Koch joint venture is ""the real killer thing about this merger,"" Borska 
said in an interview, in which she elaborated on her observations in a ""white 
paper"" analyzing the Entergy-FPL transaction. 

Once completed, the merger will put the combined company at the vanguard of 
competitive energy companies seeking convergence between physical assets and 
trading floor and risk management expertise, Borska said. 

Many companies are strong in trading floor and risk management expertise, but 
lack physical assets they can leverage in competitive electricity markets, 
Borska observed. 

On the other hand, utilities are rich in physical assets, but lack trading 
floor expertise, she said. 

In the past, ""the people who have excelled have not necessarily had physical 
assets,"" Borska said. 

But in the future, ""the people who are going to dominate are going to have 
both huge national asset portfolios and top-tier trading and risk management 
expertise,"" she said. ""It's not going to one or the other."" 

Koch has been in the top 20 in terms of trading energy. But adding the 
tremendous portfolio of power plant assets involved in the Entergy-FPL merger 
will undoubtedly bump Koch's trading into the top 10 or top five, Borska 
predicted. 

The stock transaction valued at $7 billion will bring together 48,000 
megawatts of power generation capacity, creating the nation's largest 
electric utility company with 6.3 million customers. 

Included in that staggering generation portfolio are 10,000 megawatts of 
so-called ""merchant"" power plants, which solely sell wholesale energy into 
competitive bulk-power markets, rather than serve a retail customer base. 

These competitive-market merchant plants are geographically dispersed in a 
complementary way, distributed among five regional power market hubs in the 
Northeast and mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Gulf South and Western 
states, Borska noted. 

The two companies' existing development pipeline would triple the existing 
10,000 megawatts merchant generating capacity, and plans call for growing the 
business into a 70,000-megawatt merchant-plant portfolio, Borska noted. 

""Additions to the fleet will come from additional nuclear power plant 
acquisitions and from green-field development of gas-fired plants,"" Borska 
noted in her white paper analysis of the transaction. 

The companies will be able to piggy-back onto Koch's 10,000-mile network of 
pipelines to supply their planned gas-fired power plant additions, Borska 
noted. 

The merger, when combined with the access to gas supply and trading-floor 
expertise of Koch, should cause investors to re-examine the higher valuations 
given pure-play generation companies compared to generation-rich combination 
companies, Borska said. 

AES Corp. (AES) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) have huge market valuations, but 
aren't known for engaging in ""large, deep trading,"" she said. 

""Their ability to fully leverage their assets in the marketplace has been 
limited,"" Borska said. 

The Entergy merger with FPL, when considered in light of the Koch joint 
venture, ""raises the bar for a Calpine or an AES"" to gain the capability to 
leverage their significant physical assets, Borska said. 

Other energy companies, such as Dynegy (DYN) and Duke Energy (DUK), marry 
significant generation assets with trading floor sophistication, Borska 
conceded. 

But they aren't on the same scale or geographic scope as the Entergy-FPL-Koch 
combination, she said.

Subject: Dow Jones Gas vs. Coal feature

FYI


=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. ""It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices.""
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  ""The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot,"" said
the
Raymond James report. ""Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise.""
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  ""Coal will not go away,"" said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
""The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap.""
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  ""You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years,"" he predicted. ""In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes.""
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  ""If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on,"" said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is ""very possible.""
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a ""transport reactor,"" a device based on
existing technology used to ""crack"" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  ""The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices,"" said Goodman. ""At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu.""

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  ""The $64 question is the price of gas,"" said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron 
are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal,

Subject: Re: GE Plastics Facts  

Hi David,
I'll give you a response with the hope of seeing more information that would 
change my mind.  If you are asking for my opinon, it is difficult to be 
supportive of moving ahead on a transaction like this give the fairly 
significant obstacles (these are usually deals killers) that Rodney 
describes.  What I couldn't read into Rodney's write up were other 
undocumented factors that you might change the probability, like: 

Is there an Sr. executive champion that is willing to ""influence"" the GE 
negotiating team into getting a deal done, even if the terms are less 
desirable than what Rodney laid out as their requirements?
Are the willing to extned the term so that there isn't a capital tail?
Is there any real compelling motivation for this GE Plastics team to change 
from current practice?  Do we know what that is and what the deadline for 
action for change is? 
Could Rodney suggest alternatives to address the obstacles and show the 
potential impact on the margin in the deal?  
Is there some other component of this deal that is so compelling to the 
prospect that we can attach these pieces to that?

Realistically, based on what is written, the deal you are describing sounds 
like it would have a low probability to close, surely in 2000.  
HOWEVER< if there exenuating circumstances like you feel like we just need to 
win this at all costs, there are values not being calculated that the client 
would recognize, there are senior execs at GE Plastics behind this looking 
for a way to close this, or anything else that is convincing your origination 
team that they have a winner here....then, lets find out what that is and go 
for it.

I wasn't exactly sure what you were asking for.  If it was my opinion, that 
is above.  If it was to put more resource on it to try to make the 
probability go up, I'll be glad to help.  If it is some other, just let me 
know.  

I would suggest we just start with trying to get more information from Rodney 
and team regarding why they are convinced this can be contracted for with 
margin in 2000.  I would love to participate and do what we can to make this 
work out, as long as we all agree that there are reasonable approaches to 
raising the probability of victory.  

Thanks

Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been 
sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed 
some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter 
or so.

Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the 
deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to 
closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some 
value for Enron to take this deal including:
 a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;
 b) $3 to $5 M in value;
 c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the 
large industrial customers;
 and d) provides an ""in"" to the GE family of companies which could result in 
significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Dave,

The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  

The obstacles to closure are:
- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
more
- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
- the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M

Deal Stats Are:

Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
O&M     $3   million/yr
Total     $20 million/yr

10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

Let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Rodney

we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Subject: Miscellaneous

Hey guys, just a few housekeeping notes:

1.)  Employee Expenses:  We really need to try and trim the expenses where 
and whenever possible. Get your Assistants to make all reservations for 
air/hotel/car so that they can ensure the best rates for your needs. ENA (and 
our groups) spends an incredible amount of money on travel expenses and we 
really need to attempt to trim this back where we can. Efficiencies in 
booking can probably help a lot. That means use Vitol or TAP or whoever else 
if they're cheaper and give you good service. Letting your Assistants handle 
your travel arrangements will not only ensure the best rates, it should allow 
you to spend more time on more productive endeavors! 

2.)  Customer trips/expenses: Any customer expense greater than $2000 must be 
approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman in advance of the expenditure.  
Your Assistants have the forms and once you've filled them out, I need to 
approve/sign them before going upstairs for approval.

3.)  All employee reviews should be completed by now for 
Directors/Managers/Associates/Analysts/ Assistants. All reviews should be 
written, signed by both the supervisor and employee, and given to Fran Mayes 
for filing.  Fran- If you have not received all written reviews by this 
Friday, please advise. This should include the 5 East Midstream groups and 
both the Gas and Power Structuring groups. We have just completed the VP PRC 
as of yesterday and I will be sitting down with each of the VP's for feedback 
over the next week.

4.) We are entering the homestretch for most of our deals this year and it is 
extremely important that we stay completely focused on doing everything 
possible to bring these deals to closure. Top priorities as I see them are as 
follows:

Ozzie Pagan:  TexMex, Alamac/Cogentrix, Green Jacket, Brazos/Tenaska
Jeff Ader:          NSTAR, CRRA,  Silver Oak, ConEd, NYSEG
Bruce Sukaly:  AES-NY, Assets (Cinergy/Wilton Plant/ Pontiac/Plano, 
EPNG/Wheatland, etc), AEC
Gil Muhl:            PSEG, NJN
Laura Luce:      Manlove Storage Monetization, HUB deals
Ben Jacoby:   Florida Merchant Plant, Continue building optionality on Site 
Bank, Coal Plant development
Ed and Bernie: Continue to drive the commodity deals to closure

We're definitely set up to execute on our 2000 business plan and strategy. 
The above deals are our #1 priority for the rest of the year. Let's stay very 
well coordinated on these deals and do everything we can to drive them to 
closure. Elevate any internal hurdles earlier rather than later and  I'll 
personally handle them.
There are many other deals I'd like to also see closed ( Tangerine and Ft. 
Pierce - George McCormick, Vepco/NC - Heather Kroll, ANP-Mark Bernstein, 
VNG/AGL- Ed McMichael, TXU- Jim Ducote, Energen/Haywood - Healy/Jacoby) and 
many others I'd like to continue to see get teed up for next year.  

5.)  Please forward any information above to your groups if appropriate.

Thanks!

Dave

In response to your e mail, this is meant to update you on the status of the 
search for potential coal fired generation sites.

We have used the following criteria to screen potential sites east of the 
Mississippi including the following:

 Underutilized existing coal fired generation (15 sites)
 Existing coal fired generation that is on cold stand by (12 sites)
 Coal units that have been retired (20 sites)
 Coal fired units that at one time had planned coal unit additions that were 
delayed or cancelled (11 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build coal units (13 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build nuclear units (5 sites)

We are in the process of prioritizing each site based on infrastructure, 
transmission access, market and permit status. That effort should be 
concluded this week and the study forwarded to you. We are also talking with 
two coal operators that are in the process of developing their own coal fired 
generation in Kentucky and West Virginia.

We will keep you apprised of the progress and meet with you again as we move 
to the next stage.

Dave, Marty,

In general moving the deal to just a Selkirk deal minimizes a lot of the 
concerns surrounding centralized decision making etc.  The plant manager is 
on board   
as is Doron Grossman.  As a result the sales part should be largely completed 
but the deal is far from closed.  I believe driving to closure with margin 
with GE in 2000 will be a challenge.  I haved attached some information 
regarding Marte's other questions and would be happy to discuss with the team.

Subject: Re: GE Plastics Facts  

Hi David,
I'll give you a response with the hope of seeing more information that would 
change my mind.  If you are asking for my opinon, it is difficult to be 
supportive of moving ahead on a transaction like this give the fairly 
significant obstacles (these are usually deals killers) that Rodney 
describes.  What I couldn't read into Rodney's write up were other 
undocumented factors that you might change the probability, like: 

Is there an Sr. executive champion that is willing to ""influence"" the GE 
negotiating team into getting a deal done, even if the terms are less 
desirable than what Rodney laid out as their requirements?
Are the willing to extned the term so that there isn't a capital tail?
Is there any real compelling motivation for this GE Plastics team to change 
from current practice?  Do we know what that is and what the deadline for 
action for change is? 
Could Rodney suggest alternatives to address the obstacles and show the 
potential impact on the margin in the deal?  
Is there some other component of this deal that is so compelling to the 
prospect that we can attach these pieces to that?

Realistically, based on what is written, the deal you are describing sounds 
like it would have a low probability to close, surely in 2000.  
HOWEVER< if there exenuating circumstances like you feel like we just need to 
win this at all costs, there are values not being calculated that the client 
would recognize, there are senior execs at GE Plastics behind this looking 
for a way to close this, or anything else that is convincing your origination 
team that they have a winner here....then, lets find out what that is and go 
for it.

I wasn't exactly sure what you were asking for.  If it was my opinion, that 
is above.  If it was to put more resource on it to try to make the 
probability go up, I'll be glad to help.  If it is some other, just let me 
know.  

I would suggest we just start with trying to get more information from Rodney 
and team regarding why they are convinced this can be contracted for with 
margin in 2000.  I would love to participate and do what we can to make this 
work out, as long as we all agree that there are reasonable approaches to 
raising the probability of victory.  

Thanks

Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been 
sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed 
some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter 
or so.

Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the 
deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to 
closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some 
value for Enron to take this deal including:
 a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;
 b) $3 to $5 M in value;
 c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the 
large industrial customers;
 and d) provides an ""in"" to the GE family of companies which could result in 
significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Subject: GE Plastics Facts

Dave,

The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  

The obstacles to closure are:
- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
more
- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
- the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M

Deal Stats Are:

Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
O&M     $3   million/yr
Total     $20 million/yr

10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

Let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Rodney

Subject: EES Pinnacle Event

Dave/Janet,

As you guys like a no bullshit approach, last Fall, I voiced my concerns to 
the EES management team about the second Pinnacle event (see link below).

http://pinnacle2001.proghq.com/index.html

My concerns in no particular order were:

1) Given that we have a generous bonus programme to reward staff, I felt the 
need for such an over the top event like an all expenses paid holiday in the 
West Indies for ""key"" staff and their spouses was unnecessary.
2) The lack of transparent selection criteria (""selected Superior and 
Excellent performers"") was devisive would inevitably piss off the vast 
majority of EES who didn't go on the trip.
3) Apart from disagreeing with the whole idea, I disagreed with the fact that 
all the MDs automatically got to go as that implied they were all performing 
and deserved it.
4) I didn't believe that, overall, the business was making enough money to 
justify a ""reward""  trip like this.
5) I didn't want to take my best guys out of the office for up to a week as 
we have a lot of work to do and won't make the numbers sat on a beach
6) The Europe wide Enron team works well together and there would be no way 
of justifying this trip to the rest of the London office (non EES) who 
obviously would see it for what it is - a waste of time and money

Tom conceded by saying that this one would probably be the last event of its 
kind.  Others remained silent.

I withdrew Europe from the event on the grounds that culturally in Europe 
this event was unacceptable.  Stephen Peterson (in the Europe team)  appears 
on the list of attendees, but will not attend for the reasons outlined above 
and he is OK with it.  Afterwards, I found out that McCarty boycotted the 
first event the year before for the same reasons.

Whatever you guys decide to do, Europe remains committed to hitting the 
numbers and being part of the team.

Matthew

"Re: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation","Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give 
you a call to discuss further.

Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:

 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.

PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.

Talk to you soon!!

Dave,

It would be really great for you to do that.  Unfortunately we start at 
10.30am UK / 4.30am US time (the only slot we could get for the Auditorium).  
It won't be as cool as a video link up, but if you give me a text message 
addressed to all European staff, I'll read it out.

I'll get the senior guys together on Monday for the weekly EES 2.30pm UK / 
8.30am US video conference call so you and Janet can at least speak to them.

Let's get you and Janet over to Europe to meet and greet the troops in person 
later in the year when you guys realise what you have taken on!

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

"Follow-up to ENA Orientation","Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas 
and power business.  Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to 
increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and 
generate deal flow.  As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and 
origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the 
market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have 
to wait and see.

To Everyone in the Calgary and Toronto offices (from Peter Keohane):

As you know from the numerous press stories and my earlier e-mail messages, 
the Competition Bureau conducted an investigation into the activities of 
Enron Canada Corp. and British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation regarding 
transactions in the Alberta Power Pool.  As you know, we were co-operating to 
the fullest extent possible with the investigating authorities, and we were 
confident that there was no substance to the allegations.  Accordingly, it is 
with great pleasure that I inform all of you that the Competition Bureau has 
announced in a press release, that the alleged offences under the Competition 
Act were unsubstantiated and that the Competition Bureau has closed the 
inquiry.  To quote the Competition Bureau, ""The evidence suggests that the 
companies were employing independent business strategies and were not 
colluding on bids.""  I want to thank everyone for their co-operation in 
dealing with this disruptive matter.

ENA has asked for EES customer references.  ENA is currently working with 
National Gypsum and National Gypsum has asked for two references. They would 
prefer manufacturers that have over 10% of their cost of goods sold as energy 
and have DSM projects completed at their facilities.  ENA has solicited my 
support in getting these references because when they asked EES Sales, they 
found them not to be overly cooperative with supplying names out of fear that 
ENA may burn out EES customers before EES Sales can use them.  

Since EES customers fall under Jeff's pervue, I need your help in getting the 
go-ahead to approach the account managers to set this up.  My suggestions 
would be World Color Press, Package Ice, Polaroid, or Ocean Spray.  Suiza 
would be a good choice if we could get the right person.  

ENA has asked me to get this information to them as soon as possible since 
the deal is on hold until they get the references.

Thanks,

Kurt

=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. ""It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices.""
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  ""The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot,"" said
the
Raymond James report. ""Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise.""
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  ""Coal will not go away,"" said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
""The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap.""
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  ""You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years,"" he predicted. ""In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes.""
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  ""If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on,"" said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is ""very possible.""
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a ""transport reactor,"" a device based on
existing technology used to ""crack"" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  ""The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices,"" said Goodman. ""At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu.""

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  ""The $64 question is the price of gas,"" said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

Subject: Confidential

Dwayne, in response to your request, I am providing a quick summary of our 
discussion on Friday.  As I had mentioned, this is a competitive process and 
time is of the essence.  If we get resolution to these points, I would be 
prepared to sit down over a finite period of time (three or four days) to try 
and hammer out the transaction.

Specifically:

AEP Point #2: ENA would accept a triggering event and MAC clause for the 
lease.  This would under certain conditions allow AEP to purchase the leased 
assets at the present value of the future lease payments plus the fair value 
in year thirty of the underlying assets at an agreed upon discount rate.  The 
triggering events would include bankruptcy, insolvency or Enron Corp falling 
below investment grade.  An Enron Corp guarantee would be offered to secure 
that covenant.  We would similarly ask for similar credit language in the 
lease agreement, with an AEP parental guarantee, securing the lease 
obligation from AEP.  These paragraphs would be constructed in a similar 
manner to triggering events and MAC clauses in master commodity documents.

ENA would also acknowledge that it would not sell the lease or physical 
assets underlying the lease to any other party but AEP.  I would anticipate 
that this would be managed through a ROFR structure.  This would ensure that 
AEP would have access to the assets if sold and that AEP can feel confortable 
that they will be dealing with Enron for the period of the lease.

Notwithstanding above, Enron needs the flexibility to pledge or sell the AEP 
lease stream in order to monetize your obligation to cash if desired.  This 
makes the set-off language difficult.  With the triggering event and MAC 
clause, the need for set-off to protect AEP in the event of Enron default 
should not be required.

AEP Point #5:  ENA would agree to a three month non-compete which prohibits 
ENA from soliciting business with the suppliers or producers connected to the 
Pipeline.  This non-compete would apply to transactions over one month in 
duration. This would apply to ENA only and no other Enron Corp affiliates.

AEP Point #6:  I believe that ENA has already agreed in principal to your 
request under this point.

AEP Point #1:  ENA would require indemnity limitation, including 
representation and warranties and basic construction, similar to our last 
draft language previously provided to you.  Would also request a two year 
window rather than three on environmental claims.

AEP Point #3:  ENA would counter with a $40 million break up fee if AEP does 
not get requisite SEC approval by April 1, 2001.

AEP Point #4:  On HSR and FERC approvals, AEP's position as layed out in the 
letter is not practical since it would be very difficult to pull out certain 
pieces of the pipe from the deal and ensure that both parties get the benefit 
of the bargain.  If AEP is unwilling to give an asset divestment covenant and 
given AEP's limited gas infrastructure position,  ENA's position is that AEP 
should take the risk that they will be able to get the approvals.  

Other:  ENA will not agree as a condition to this transaction a settlement of 
any FERC issues between AEP and EPMI; however, ENA would always be willing to 
discuss such items in a different forum.

If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact myself or 
Tim Detmering.

Dave Delainey

Subject: Re: Basic  

Dave, I agree with your perspective on this.  Building another theoretical 
model in the Basic situation seems naive to me.  This company is and has been 
in a financial death spiral.  For months, all involved on the ENA side have 
been focused on a probability that the Basic situation would result in a 
writeoff of a very significant piece of the Merlin debt and nothing for the 
equity.  The deal we are working on is at the high end of the projections 
reviewed with the rating agencies on recovery for the Merlin debt and 
actually gets us at least some chance of recovery on our equity.

I do not agree that no effort has been made to market the company.  As you 
recall, we worked very intensively in trying to support an IPO which would 
take out the debt.  Despite many attempts to structure a successful offering 
(and a series of difficult concessions by Enron), the IB finally pulled it.  
The S-1, by the way, was about the ugliest I have ever seen.

We carefully evaluated seeking an industry purchaser.  Our conclusion was 
that this risked losing significant value, would require a good deal of time, 
and had virtually no likelihood of equalling the recovery we have would 
achieve if we can do the deal on the table.   This evaluation was reinforced 
with the contacts we have had with industry players.

In any liquidation there is always the possibility that another path could 
possibility capture more value.  In this case especially, I think we have a 
very good idea of reality and are making an uniformed decision to recommend a 
better-than-exected exit.  This is not a firesale.

We will continue to work constructively with RAC in a non-confrontational 
mode on Basic.  Be assured, however, that if I feel there is a real risk of 
process getting in the way of achieving our objectives, I will raise a red 
flag.  Dick.

B'fast Friday looks fine, it's on the calendar!  

Re: the coal strategy, you're exactly right.  There is however one major 
impediment.  While locating the plant near/at the source (i.e., mine-mouth) 
will ease transport costs for coal, there aren't many major coal mines 
located in the prime market zones for power.  The transmission (wires) grid 
was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk trading/transport the way gas does 
and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous (infinitely more so 
than building new plants).  For example, the average lead time to permit (not 
built, just permit) a high-voltage power line is 5-7 years!  As a result, a 
medium sized line (345kv, 200 miles) can cost upwards of $1-2 billion!  That 
was the most frustrating part of the 18 months I chased this stuff.  While 
the basic solutions appear to be so logical, the business (the utilities), 
regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking 
that breaking in was basically impossible.  Unless we're willing to put a 
billion $ at risk for 5-7 years on a merchant basis!  (NOT!)  Hell, you can't 
even get $100 million for your refinery deal!  Solving the power supply 
shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new 
technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas.  But until the FERC and 
state PUCs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more ""fungible"" 
and integrated transmission system, the utilities will continue to operate in 
their vacuum as these transmission barriers are the only things protecting 
their turfs.  Even though some have given the appearance of forming 
RTO's/ISO's (regional transmission organizations or independent system 
operators) this is simply a facade of utilities banding together to cover 
each other's asses.  The assets are still owned by the utilities themselves 
and the RTO/ISO has no authority to mandate expansion or anything requiring 
capital investment, other than routine maintenance, etc...  That's the whole 
genesis of what I was trying to preach to FERC, various utilities who 
""appeared"" to be more forward thinking about dereg, etc...  Basically, you'd 
be trading one evil (transport for fuel) for another (transport for 
electrons) and I'm afraid the latter is infinitely more complex (engineering 
wise) and costly.

See ya' Friday!

brownfield opportunities - but I haven't heard of any developments.

Subject: coal plants

George,

I'm sure I am way over simplifying this, but in light of current natural gas 
prices and the past success ENA had building six natural gas power plants 
wouldn't the same template work for building coal fired power plants in the 
US? I'm sure the choosing of potential sites and the overall permitting 
process is far more severe than the natural gas process, but it would seem 
Enron could and should be a leader in proposing new coal plants. Wouldn't it 
make sense to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual 
coal supply, whereby we avoid the ever increasing transportation costs and 
then supply power by wire to surrounding states. States rich in coal reserves 
are always looking for more jobs which a new power plant would create and 
therefore may speed the permitting process along. Building the power 
transmission infrastructure across state lines may be cost prohibitive, but 
has this approach been analyzed by the coal group? 

Regards,
Doug

Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's 
review and then detailed review with each team.

This workbook has a number of worksheets including:
 a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we 
own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC;
 b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay 
expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be 
offset by larger monetizations;
 c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external 
capital charges are added back to reach EBIT;
 d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget;
 e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT 
non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups 
and bonus/other comp;
 f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 
assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond;
 g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, 
assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then 
calculates a net capital and depreciation charge;
 h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no 
anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant 
investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are 
charged @ a blended rate of 9%.

Two action items:
 a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his 
comment and review &
 b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for 
distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of 
weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet 
(including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), 
leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would 
like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.

Janet and Bruce,

On behalf of the Analyst and Associate Program, I want to take this 
opportunity to let you know what a wonderful job Michelle Parks did while 
recruiting at Cornell.  I don't know whether you are aware but we had an 
interviewer not show up.  He also had not called to cancel.  Michelle was in 
the lobby waiting to leave and became aware of the situation.  Although she 
had pressing business in Houston, she made arrangements to stay so that we 
did not have to cancel the schedule.  
Cornell is one of our core schools and it would have been quite embarrassing 
to cancel a full schedule.

We truly appreciate Michelle selflessness and believe she more than exhibits 
Enron's vision and values.  She should be commended.  

Thanks

Charlene Jackson

Subject: Re: Q4  

Dave, Origination & Finance has booked roughly C$8MM Quarter to Date.  

For the remainder of the quarter, I will attempt to give you a break-down 
based on probability:

""Highly Likely""
Done Deals    C$8MM
Papier Masson Service Fee Income C$1MM
PCOG Strategic Alliance Extension C$2MM
Chippawa Capacity Assignment  C$1MM
Misc. Marketing Deals   C$1MM
Total     C$13MM

""Probable""
Papier Masson Write-up/Monetization C$10MM (ECC's share only)
MAP Auction    C$2MM
Blue Range Final Dividend  C$1MM
Calpine Capacity Assignment  C$2MM (ECC's share only)
Total     C$15MM

""Unclear""
Tax Mitigation    C$10MM
Turbine Sale    C$2MM
Clarica Funding Deal for PPA  C$1MM
Total     C$13MM

Papier Masson is proceding nicely,as the owners have agreed to sell the asset 
. The owners have also agreed to a structure in principle, whereby they have 
determined a range that they are willing to sell at. If enron exceeds the 
range, they are bound to sell it to Houston P&P group. If we bid inside the 
range they then have 8 weeks to shop us, and if they dont receive any offers, 
enron buys the mill at our bid less C$5MM. If they shop us and receive a 
third party offer, they pay enron a break fee of C$5MM. If they close with a 
third party, we receive an additional C$10MM. At a minimum, this provides us 
with a fair market valuation by an independent/outside party that we can use 
as our basis for writing up the asset. Secondly, it allows the P&P group to 
bid without being a stalking horse as it provides for hefty break fees and 
significant earnings on closing. 

With regards to tax mitigation, I will have a better idea by the end of this 
week. The tax guys are up from Houston and we will be working on it the 
remainder of the week.

fyi...British Energy is now worth >C$100MM at the desk's bid. We are still 
working toward a May 1, 2001 market opening. Support for a may 1 start is 
mounting and has become a very public topic consistently referring to May 1.

I met with 7 associates and 1 analyst  over lunch to discuss the Analyst and 
Associate Program.  The major concern expressed by everyone in the meeting 
was that the program has become a bureaucracy vs a meritocracy.  According to 
the Associates, the program has become inflexible on any issue and the only 
feedback they receive is ""go talk to Skilling if you don't like the 
answers"".  Another major concern was compensation.  After listening to the 
comments, my conclusion is that there are some problems that need to be 
addressed.  Specific recommendations by this small group include (1) reduce 
amount of time in program before promotion to manager from 18 months to 12 
months, (2) increase Associates involvement in rotation decisions, (3) 
explanations of why the program is structured in a certain way without 
defensive comments of ""go talk to Skilling"", (4) generally, more of an open 
market approach so that we are using a ""carrot vs stick"" method to motivate 
behavior.

Let me know about the next meeting to discuss.

As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

I would like to introduce myself for consideration to working within your 
respective groups, but also including some commercial ideas relative to the 
South American region and elsewhere.  

I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, 
and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.   

I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, 
including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron.


Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.

Gentelmen,

Following is an email detailing requests for personal contributions to 
legislators who have been instrumental to Enron regarding our power plants in 
Tennessee.  I produced this list based on recommendations from our lobbying 
firm, Stokes Bartholomew, in Nashville.

In 1999, Stokes Bartholomew, working with Jordan Mintz in Enron's tax 
department, convinced the state legislature to pass legislation clarifying 
that Enron's power plants would be exempt from the gross receipts tax.  Had 
we not succeeded in the effort, we would have had to pay gross receipts taxes 
of approximately $1.5 million per year.  

In 2000, Tennessee is one of the only states in the union that has been 
running a deficit in the general revenue fund.  Rather than going home for 
the summer, the legislature stayed in session and debated among themselves 
and with the Governor on how to solve the revenue shortfall issue.  
Eventually, they adopted unreasonably  optimistic revenue projections to 
produce a balanced budget (on paper).   This has not solved the problem 
because the state is already $100 million below revenue projections in the 
first quarter of the fiscal year.  The legislature will look for a long term 
solution when it returns in January.  Stokes Bartholomew informs me that all 
sources of revenue will be considered - this means our exemption from the 
gross receipts tax could possibly be repealed.  At this time, no one is 
singling this exemption out, but Stokes Bartholomew is cautious and is 
monitoring the issue closely.

Numerous legislators supported the gross receipts legislation for Enron.  If 
our gross receipts tax exemption is threatened next legislative session, we 
would have to return to these same legislators (if they are reelected) for 
support.  As long as Enron pays taxes in Tennessee, it behooves us to take an 
active interest in supporting those legislators who will defend our interests 
in the capitol.

Since you are the key contacts at Enron for Tennessee, I ask you to assess 
this matter and decide whether ongoing legislative support is important to 
Enron's interests in TN and make contributions accordingly.

I have recommended $9,500 in contributions.  While this seems like a large 
amount, it is miniscule in comparison to the taxes we are not paying.  
Moreover, it will go a long way to helping us protect our interests against 
those who would fight to have ""big corporations"", particularly out-of-state 
corporations, get stuck with additional tax burdens to solve the state's 
fiscal woes.

You are probably asking why we are not using Enron PAC funds or coroporate 
funds to make these donations.  Tennessee law prohibits us from using 
corporate funds and limits the use of PAC funds to those PACs that do not 
receive any source of support from the corporation.  Because Enron Corp. pays 
the expenses for the Enron PAC, we are not permitted to contribute Enron PAC 
funds to candidates in Tennessee.  This is one of the most onerous political 
contribution laws in the country.

If you have any questions I can be reached for the next week at 
614.306.4359.  Or you can leave a message for me at 614.760.7472.

Per our phone conversation, following is a list of key legislative leaders 
deserving of Enron's support.  This list has been developed by our 
counsel/legislative agents in Nashville: Bill Bruce, Gif Thornton and Robert 
Gowan.

Please feel free to call me to discuss further.  You can reach me on my cell 
phone this afternoon and all day tomorrow.  I will be in the office on Monday.

Lieutenant Governor: Senator John Wilder (Democrat)
$2,500
Represents Brownsville in the Senate.
Sponsor of 1999 gross receipts tax exemption legislation for Brownsville.
Has a serious opponent this November.
The Senate elects the Lieutenant Governor who also serves as the head of the 
Senate.  It is in Enron's best interst that John Wilder win the election and 
be re-elected Lieutenant Governor. 

Rep. Jimmy Naifey
$1,000
Speaker of the House
Represents Brownsvile.

Senate Candidate Larry Trail (Democrat)
$2,000
John Wilder's personal mission, besides his own election, is to get Larry 
elected to the Senate (it is an open seat that is being vacated by a 
Democrat).
If the Democrats lose this seat there is a very good chance that Senator 
Wilder will not be re-elected Lieutenant Governor because the Democrats will 
have lost the majority in the Senate.

Rep. Matt Kisber (Democrat)
$1,500
Represents the Jackson area.
Very pro-business Democrat.
Is in a very tough race because the district was redrawn and it now majority 
Republican.
Matt is the chair of the House Finance, Ways and Means Committee - which 
hears all gross receipts tax matters.
Was very helpful to Enron on the gross receipts legislation.

Senator Jerry Cooper
$1,000
Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee
His committee hears all legislation relating to energy and power plants.

Rep. Shelby Rinehart
$500
Chair of Commerce Committe (all energy and power plant issues) and powerful 
member of the House Finance and Ways and Means Committee.
He is extremely powerful.  Bill, Gif and Robert have a very good relationship 
and rely on him for assistance for their clients regularly.

Unless otherwise noted, checks should be make payable to ""Friends of 
_______________"".

Please forward to Bill Bruce fo personal delivery.  (or if you want to get 
them to me I can pass them along)

coordinate a meeting between Mark Muller/Lou Pai and himself.  I only want 
Lou going up if Tom is involved.  However, Mark Muller is up to go and I have 
spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.  He is expecting your 
call.

On a related note, I volunteered Wes Colwell (our controller and former 
Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson 
auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values 
inside Peoples.  I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.  If Wes 
goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the 
appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so Wes can spend the least 
amount of time on this issue.

Jeff, where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to Mark Muller 
about a couple weeks back?

Mark, I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in 
the New Power Company - Tony Altman (President of FPL wholesale) would like 
to discuss.  If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.  If you don't 
think you will have any interest let me know and I will call him to let him

I would like to put the wheels in motion to investigate the opportunity we 
discussed yesterday.  

Although my initial reaction is that I truely enjoy Portland and my current 
position (it's cold in Canada) and believe I can add real value here over the 
next year or two, the opportunitiy to build help build a business and broaden 
my experience with a move to Toronto is positive.  I need more information to 
feel comfortable making this decision.  So, please advise me as to when I can 
contact Paul DeVries and Rob Milnthorp (and who else I should contact) to get 
into the details..  

Thanks for the opportunity!

Subject: Heartland Industrial Partners

Dave, in May 2000 Enron North America committed to invest up to $30 million 
in Heartland Industrial Partners L.P., a private equity fund.  The terms of 
the fund investment are fairly typical (and not particularly exciting for a 
limited partner such as we).  The deal was ""sold"" on the basis of ENA getting 
exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by 
the fund if these were cost effective.  The claimed benefits for the energy 
management tie were calculated at $20 - 50 million.  The deal was originated 
by Brad Dunn who now is in EIM.   Ownership of this commitment had been 
assigned to Jim Ajello.

The kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now 
provided by EES.  While they are happy to exploit any opportunity, their 
business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this 
kind of deal.  In short, they have no interest in picking up the commitment 
(and capital employed) via an intercompany transfer.

Private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the 
normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years.  The Heartland partnership 
has a 10-year life,  Enron did negotiate the right to sell its LP interest 
after 3 years.  As a practical matter, that right guarantees neither a fair 
price or even a market.

There is no logical home for this investment that I know of in ENA except in 
my portfolio.  Question: is this an ENA responsibility or would it move to 
EIM's balance sheet?  If we (ENA) have no choice but to retain the 
investment, my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to 
monetize funds invested to-date (about $6 million) and sell the remaining 
commitment.  Since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership 
interests, however, it will be extremely difficult to get out of our 
investment/commitment in the foreseeable future.  Under any circumstances 
finding a buyer will be time-consuming and expensive.  (This is a poster 
child for ""patient"" investment capital).

I want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is 
that the obligation should be transferred to EIM which I believe has assumed 
the charter of the ENA group that formerly managed this investment.  Dick.

Subject: Retail Branding

Dave, Pope has been working with the Stampeder organization for the last six 
months on creating a sponsorship package for our Retail business. Our first 
goal was to attempt to get the naming rights to McMahon Stadium (not unlike 
the Canadian Airlines Saddledome, Enron Field, etc.). At this point the 
naming rights are off the table. However, we have the opportunity to grab the 
naming rights to the Labour Day Classic as well as some other season-long 
involvement. Terms of the deal at this point are as follows:

1. ""Enron Labor day Classsic"" and 100 thirty-second radio spots promoting the 
Enron Labor day Classic + Newspaper Ads
 40,000 Enron logo cheering towels to be distributed pre-game
 Exclusive sponsorship on the cover of the game day program
 Enron logo on the player's jerseys

2. Season long involvement 
 End-Zone advertising
 1 full-page color ad in the Stamp's 2001 yearbook
 12 season tickets
 12 red & white club memberships

Cost would be approx $100K Cdn (still be negotiated). 

In terms of our overall strategy for branding, this is likely the only 
initiative that we would pursue in 2001 as we like that it has good 
penetration for the entire province of Alberta as well as national exposure. 
The Labour day game draws the biggest crowd each season, has been sold out 
eight out the past nine seasons, and is the largest single day sporting event 
in Calgary each year. Last year the ""battle of Alberta"" attracted over 
750,000 viewers on CBC. The timing is also very good as we will be fully 
functional by September. 

Let me know what you think.

Subject: Fidelity update

Last week during the holidays, we made a lot of progress w/ Fidelity 
regarding their ""take-out"" from the Partnership at Dallas.  We exchanged 2 
drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 
99% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 
2001.  Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would 
be extinguished.  However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're 
not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.  The way the deal w/ 
Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM 
initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close 
(est to be $300K+/-).  Fidelity wants 2 things:

protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits 
accrued (i.e., the $300K), and
protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they 
were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001).

There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:

replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a 
specific cap on the tax credit amount ($300K+/-) and with the same 
environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to 
issues which occurred while they were a partner.  The probability of either 
ever being triggered is extremely remote.  Replacing the benefactor from LGI 
to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental 
exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP 
interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.
replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides 
Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.  Per ENA accounting 
since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would 
not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance 
sheet item.

The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty ""in hand"" and unless you give 
me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any 
leverage to get them to release it.  They are willing to work with us on 
either of the 2 alternatives listed above.  This is the only remaining 
commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.

Please advise or call to discuss further.  Ext. 33212.  Thanks!

Effective May 19, I have replaced Elisabeth McCabe as head of ENA's Public 
Relations department.  With the recent reconfiguration of the ENA staff 
meeting, public relations has not been included.  I believe it is important 
to be in attendance at the weekly staff meetings, so public relations can 
stay abreast of the various deals/projects and be prepared to handle the 
public relations surrounding them.

I would like to request that I be added to the list of regular attendees.  
Additionally, I believe it would be helpful for Kathryn Corbally from 
Corporate Investor Relations to be in attendance as well.  She attended the 
meetings in the past and should be included for the same reasons.  If you 
would like to discuss this issue, please call me at ext. 3-9053.

Can you let me know who you forwarded the information on the MHI turbines 
to?  Mitsubishi has received some information inquiries directly from other 
Enron areas about utilizing the machines in North America.  If MHI learns 
that we are considering moving the machines at this point, this will create 
siginificant problems in closing the year end re-financing.  I need to

"Mass. General","Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your 
capabilities better than ours.  

In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, 
part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric 
contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW 
of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all 
their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP 
controls in the nation.

The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him 
yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is 
a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like 
the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good 
lead into the health care segment.

Subject: Nella Cappelletto - Resignation


It is with great regret that I announce that Nella has resigned from Enron 
Canada effective July 14th.  Nella has been with Enron Canada for 61/2 years, 
including many of the formative years.  

Nella has been an extraordinarily valuable asset to Enron Canada and she will 
be greatly missed.  Frankly, for all Nella has done for Enron Canada, and the 
dedication, commitment and sincerity with which she has done it, she cannot 
be replaced.  Nella has been instrumental in the development and ongoing 
maintenance and administration of our contracting forms, precedent systems, 
confirmation letters, contracting files, contract diarization and data base 
systems,  and has had significant input on the development and/or 
implementation of key corporate and managerial policies and controls.  

More importantly, Nella always appreciated that, because of the nature of our 
business, our core assets are our contractual rights, and with much personal 
commitment, and often at much personal expense, Nella always endeavored to 
ensure that things not only got done, but that they got done properly and 
punctually.  I know that Linda, Greg, Mark and I (and many of you) will 
discover aspects of our jobs which we did not know existed because they were 
so capably and quietly looked after by Nella.

Most importantly, Nella had great personal commitment to do all she could 
within the limits of available resources to help us achieve our personal 
objectives at Enron Canada, whether or not realistic.  Many of us, in many 
cases without even knowing it, could not have achieved many of our own 
individual accomplishments at Enron Canada without Nella's commitment and 
dedication.

Nella will be missed, and I ask you to bear with us as we continue to try 
meet your requests until we are able to hire a suitable replacement.

Regards, Peter.

Subject: 


Dick,

I have done some more research on the cost versus Peaker Fee issue.  The 
numbers from ENA's side lay out as follows:

ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs  $4,449,000
ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete $   720,000
Reduction in Variable Overheads  $3,000,000
IDC on ENA Overpayments   $   200,000
Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable  $   180,000
Westinghouse L.D.'s- Gleason   $1,800,000
Westinghouse L.D.'s- Wheatland  $   500,000
Preliminary Total Reduction
in Project Costs                  $10,849,000


ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs:  ENA paid according to pre-determined cash 
curves every month.  NEPCO's actual costs appear to be coming in about $4.5 
MM less per the audit results that we both reviewed last Friday.

ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete:  When we met last Friday, there were 
$1,459,000 of Open P.O.'s and other items that NEPCO still needed to 
investigate and closeout, you have a copy of the detailed schedule prepared 
by Amy Spoede.  Of the $1,459,000, there was $720,000 showing as still owing 
to ABB for Circuit Breakers at Wilton Center.  ABB has informed ENA that they 
have been payed in full for quite some time, thus I believe that this 
$720,000 is an accounting phantom that NEPCO needs to clear up.

Reduction in Variable Overheads:  The $3,000,000 in variable overhead 
reduction is the number that you offered to cut this cost in our meeting last 
Friday.

IDC on ENA Overpayments:  As part of our agreement with EE&CC/NEPCO, ENA 
agreed to pay 2000 peaker construction costs based upon cash curves versus 
actual invoices.  The cash curves consistently overestimated NEPCO's actual 
disbursements, even after quarterly audits and true-ups.  NEPCO currently 
owes ENA over $200,000 in IDC at the cost of capital charged by Enron Corp.

Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable:  Some EE&CC/NEPCO personnel coded time 
against variable overheads that should have been charged against the 
pre-agreed fixed overheads. 

Westinghouse L.D.'s:  ENA paid Westinghouse directly for the turbines.  ENA 
has held back $3.5 MM of retainage pending resolution of L.D.'s.  
EE&CC's/ENA's position is that Westinghouse owes $2.3 MM of L.D.'s ($1.8 MM @ 
Gleason, $0.5MM @ Wheatland).  The aforementioned L.D.'s are for delivery and 
schedule delays at Gleason and Wheatland.  There is an additional $1.0-1.6 MM 
of performance L.D.'s for missing heat rate guarantees at Gleason.  ENA will 
negotiate the performance L.D. settlement directly with Westinghouse because 
the cure will be getting additional MW's in trade against the L.D.'s.  
Otherwise, Westinghouse can cure by minor unit modifications and re-test 
versus paying cash L.D.'s.  However, the Delivery and Schedule L.D.'s will 
still be negotiated by EE&CC.

Peaker Fee Settlement:  Based on our last meeting and additional research, I 
suggest the following path to quickly resolve the Peaker fee amount and 
payment.  If EE&CC will take over the risk/reward of the Delivery & Schedule 
L.D. issue with Westinghouse, then ENA will recharacterize the amounts 
detailed above as Peaker fee payment.  If EE&CC is successful in keeping all 
the Schedule L.D.'s from Westinghouse, then it would have a $10.85 MM fee 
versus $9.2 MM.  EE&CC only needs to keep $650,000 of the $2.3 MM of 
Westinghouse Schedule L.D.'s to have a $9.2 MM fee.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here.

Regards,

Mike J Miller

portfolio managers in each origination group responsible for each investment.

Portfolio Managers

Steve Pruett - Energy Capital Resources - (E&P)
Chuck Ward - Generation Investments
Chris Helfrick - Industrials and Coal
Michael Miller - Principal Investing
Richard Lydecker - Restructuring
Ray Bowen - CTG
Andrea Reed - CTG
Wes Colwell - Controller
Jordan Mintz - Tax

Management

Jeff Skilling
Joe Sutton
Mark Frevert
Dave Delainey


I don't think we need to distribute this data farther.  The business unit 
heads in the finance origination groups can access their portfolio manager 
for the data if needed.

Subject: Enron North America - Asset Snapshots Q1 2000

Dave:  I am having delivered to your office this afternoon a proof copy of 
our snapshot book for ENA for Q1, 2000.  Before we distribute to others, Rick 
Buy and I thought we should check in with you on the distribution list which 
is included on the letter attached to the snapshots. (also attached below)   
You may recall that last quarter we cut down the distribution considerably by 
requiring anyone who wanted a book to contact us.  The people on the attached 
list were those that specifically requested a book.  One other thing to 
note:  this time we have included overall portfolio and return numbers in the 
front of the book.  This may affect your decision on how you want the book 
distributed within ENA.

Your advice on additions/deletions to the distribution list is appreciated.  
If you have questions, please give me a call.

              Regards,

              Rick C.

"Retail in South America","Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not 
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product 
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large 
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority 
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I 
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business 
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

Subject: Retail in South America

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
Key points for discussion will be:

-brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
-brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
through wholesale
-discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
retail business a success:
 -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
 -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake


Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
involved present on the call/meeting.

John Swafford spoke with David Vander in Wes' group last Tuesday and informed 
him that, after reviewing matters, the Corp. State and Local Group had 
reduced the charge to ENA from $821,000 to $321,000.  This reduction goes far 
to bringing costs in line with those from last year and, the remainder of the 
increase, relates to the expansion of support at Corp. related to the 
expansion of ENA's business.  Best regards.  Steve.

Subject: Re: 2001 Plan  

I spoke with Bob Hermann this afternoon and, in short, the single biggest 
contributor to the increase in the corporate tax allocation relates to the 
expansion of state and local tax support being provided to our new ""business 
verticals"" - that is, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and 
Enron Net Works - which expense should be specifically allocated to such 
groups rather than ENA, as is currently the case.  I will follow up with you 
regarding the revised number after I have resolved the allocation issue.  
Best regards.  Steve.

Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.

"ENA Analyst and Associate ""Brownbag"" Presentations","It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality 
flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well 
as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in 
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your 
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in 
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your 
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a 
presentation.  The first ""brownbag"" will take place September 8 between 
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by 
Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.  
Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is 
that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and 
execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is 
an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. 
The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule 
between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia 
Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business 
is the perview of ECC.

Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the 
deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done 
and can help in the pitch.

Subject: Re: Tembec and US Originators  

Dave, my thoughts regarding your note:

This is not what we agreed to in Columbia Lakes. You were very clear on the 
point that ENA Industrial Marketing had enough to do South of the border. We 
have staffed up our Industrial Marketing Team in Toronto and are covering all 
industrials (on a full-time basis) which meet our load threshold in Ontario. 
Unlike the U.S., Ontario is a relatively small market where we can and have 
complete coverage. Paul and his group have done a tremendous job at 
positioning Enron in this marketplace, demonstrating our core competencies, 
and developing credibility. The last thing I want is some marketer up here 
from the U.S. selling the box without knowing how to fill that box (ie does 
not know the market fundamentals, rules or regulatory regime). This does 
nothing for Enron as it confuses the customer on who they should be talking 
to and destroys whatever credibility we had created to date. I have attached 
for your reference, a status report on industrial coverage.

Perhaps the problem lies in how we are defining outsourcing. As you know, 
there exists a continuum from portfolio management through to the energy 
island concept. Enron Canada has been pitching the entire outsourcing 
continuum recognizing that for many of these industrials, they will want to 
walk before they run. The majority that we have talked to are interested in 
portfolio management, our market expertise & information, wholesale 
settlement services, and assistance with market opening readiness. I cant 
imagine how a U.S. originator could talk to or offer these services to 
Canadian Industrials. This is clearly in Enron Canada's wheelhouse.

With respect to the opposite side of the outsourcing continuum, it makes 
total sense to have ENA utilize its resources in pursuing energy island, 
asset outsourcing type structures. With these opportunities, I see ENA taking 
the lead with ECC second chair. Where these opportunities are identified by 
ECC, we will forward these to the appropriate ENA originator. To date, ENA 
and ECC have worked well on Blue Circle, Terra, Co-Steel and Nexfor.

As for Tembec, I am confused with what you mean by not changing the deal 
team. Kelli Metcalf has been up here twice talking to Tembec about a cogen in 
an area that does not make any economic sense. Jan and Paul have met with 
Tembec a number of times and we have had extensive discussions with Tembec 
specific to Ontario, Portfolio Management, Wholesale Settlement Services, 
Supply Procurement, and Asset Optimization. I realize that Bryan Burnett has 
an excellent relationship with Tembec and we should leverage off of this, but 
to simply ""keep ECC in the loop"" is fundamentally absurd and is not in 
Enron's best interests.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is 
similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:

 a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the 
paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;
 b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no 
outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron 
Mexico; 
 c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I 
would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in 
which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work 
together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding 
outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC 
and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico 
coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in 
Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to 
clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people 
and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer 
(ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the 
sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and 
execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am 
expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for 
Canada and Mexico;
 and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at 
this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and 
if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to 
ECC.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I 
thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My 
understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:

1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and 
Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian 
Facilities.

2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.

3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & 
Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all 
other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs 
to be co-ordinated.

Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to 
talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC 
has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US 
facilities.

It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to 
get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the 
interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing 
arrangement.

Subject: Tembec and US Originators

Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and 
energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about 
the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the 
Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian 
companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps 
and to some extent, new SPV's.

In this instance,

1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company
2.  All their assets are in Canada
3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility
4.  We know the executive team at Tembec
5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy 
market which is their focus right now
6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement 
similar to the US pitches

With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up 
here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and 
hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying 
that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to 
her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and 
knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the 
technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team 
put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.  
However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this 
office!!!

I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the 
meeting and deliver the ""Enron"" message, but going forward we need to have 
this resolved.


Cheers, Paul D

Subject: Are we finding value in outsourcing? - GE Plastics

This week we will begin discussions on structure and pricing with GE 
Plastics.  At the risk of getting committed to earnings delivery I thought it 
would be helpful to give a range of value to us & GE at least before the 
economics start to deteriorate in negotiations.  Currently the proposal would 
require GE to step up to ten year fixed price positions that would create the 
following split up of economics:

Savings to GE $33MM PV
Value to Enron $15MM with $10MM of this value in bookable mark to market
$40 MM in capital invested in the Demand Side Management Projects.

I think that this suggests there should be value in our outsourcing efforts.

Thanks,
Rodney

Please forward to the person in charge of New Generation Projects.

I was referred to you by the Energy Information Agency.  I was wondering if 
you could help me find new generation work within your company.  If you are 
not in the market for additional capacity I would appreciate your comments on 
how I might proceed.

We primarily install, relocate or otherwise put power in service on a turnkey 
basis, virtually anywhere in the world.   We also do major repairs, 
mechanical and electrical, rotating equipment and even substation 
equipment.    We have a rather strange assortment of equipment to support our 
work, special hydra lift trailers for moving large engine without 
disassembly, cranes for use in trying areas, high voltage bucket trucks, a 
portable repair shop that can be moved to a major site that is 100 ft X 60 ft 
and is fully equipped for anything from turbine repairs, installs or we can 
do a large rewind ..

For off-shore work we have a floating shop, a service vessel that has 
equipment on-board to move generation or also do similar service and 
repairs.     An example might be a turbine or other generation installation 
even on a barge power plant that is in service .. we can often dock along 
side and do it all as though the barge was in a harbor.

Sometimes, in addition to supplying New Equipment, we can supply used, 
refurbished or surplus assets.  Several possible powerplants considered for 
relocation are made available by Marcor Remediation Inc.  Marcor is working 
with the Jacksonville Electric Authority, Basin Electric and other major US 
utilities to offer certain Surplus Generating Assets to the worlds energy 
sectors.  This equipment is listed in some detail on our company webpage
(http://www.marcor.com/services/sales/sales.htm.)    This is a partial 
listing so let me know if your company contacts are in the market for 
anything in particular, we may be able to help.

These are additional properties I am working on, we handle Turnkey 
installations all over the world as well as a good deal of offshore work.   
Currently, we can deliver an LM 6000, up and running in less than 90 days.

placed in an escrow account with draws for the preparation of same and 
expenses incurred.  An Executed ""Non-Disclosure, Non-Compete, Non-Circumvent 
Agreement"" must be signed by the ""end-user"".  It will take two (2) weeks, 
after receipt of one-percent (1%) cash advance funds, and after ALL pertinent 
information regarding the ultimate construction of the barge is received by 
us from the buyer, to prepare the Formal Quotation.

After receipt of the Formal Quotation/Proposal,  buyer shall have two (2) 
weeks to place a five-percent (5%) refundable deposit which will allow him 
thirty (30) days to perform ""due diligence"".  At the end of this ""due 
diligence"" period, buyer shall pay eighty-five percent (85%) of the total 
purchase price.  The balance due shall be paid upon customer acceptance of

paragraph:

 ""Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave, in the 
Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing 
Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES

Subject: Plan Questions

The total depreciation plan number for west trading is $278,000.  Here is the 
general breakdown

    Net Book Value  Planned Amount  Depreciation Period
Floor Buildouts   $462,000  $135,000   3 to 5 years
PC's and Monitors  $214,000  $50,000    3 years
Large Plasma Screens  $77,000   $46,000    3 years
Other    $25,000   $7,000    3 years
2001 Increase      $40,000 

Total    $778,000  $278,000


Here is the headcount breakdown:



   Current   2001 Plan  Change  Realistically
Trading   41   48   +7  +5   (2 RT, 2 analysts on desk, 1 admin.)
Mid Mkt & Svcs  9   12   +3  +1 or +2  (increase coverage)
Fundamentals  7   9   +2  +1   (supply person with hydro knowledge)
Structuring  0   0   0  +2   (group is 4 -- Chris planned half, I need to 
plan for half)

Totals   57   69   +12  +9 or +10

It looks like my number is two or three too high.  We also had a mixup on 
planning for the existing structuring group.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.


Also,  I need to talk to you about the City of Vernon.  I want to sue them.  
Several months ago they flaked on a purchase that has cost us about 
$10,000,0000.  Richard Sanders has done the basic legwork and it looks like 
we have a decent case.  I talked to Chris about it, and we both agree that it 
doesn't hurt the west business if we poke them in the eye.  They are not well 
liked in the muni community out here, so the collateral damage should be 
minimal.  The big question is how will this appear in the face of all of the 
ongoing investigations?  Perhaps we should set up a call with me, you, Lavo, 
Sanders, Calger, and Kean?  Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: ENA Management Committee

As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent 
with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power 
business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As 
part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and 
decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, 
this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic 
direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a 
pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon 
starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The 
Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The 
meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, 
staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on 
this Friday.  

Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire 
meeting and to be on time.

As a follow up to our conversations on the origination function within ENA, I 
was hoping that you could join us at our middle marketing team meeting on 
September 21 at 4:00 pm. I think it would be beneficial if you shared your 
views on origination currently and its role (s) in the future. This would 
also be an excellent forum for you to discuss ENA's short and long- term

If this date is not amenable to you, please let me know when you would be

September 13, 2000

Dear Mr. Bibi,

After giving more thought to our initial conversation, I have attached a
short document comparing Blacklight's (BLP) technology to fuel cell
technology.  BLP is developing a technology for the distributed electric
market.  We have prototypes under development, and the costs for our
technology compare favorably to the existing market.  The brochure will
elaborate on the advantages of our technology.

As we discussed, BLP is an R&D firm contacting companies that might have
complementary assets which would expedite the commercialization of our
technology.  As a result of our first discussion, I understand that Enron
might not be interested in new generation technology.  I wanted to provide
you with additional information on BLP.  If Enron's strategies change,
please contact me.  If you know other companies interested in investing or
joint developing a new generation technology, please let me know.  Thank you
for taking the time to review our materials.

Best Regards,

William Good

Subject: Get your thumbscrews out

Folks,
Attached is a list of 37 executives, not yet enrolled on the ""exective impact 
and influence"" programme administered by Dick Amabile.
The OTC clearly set the goal at the beginning of the year, and repeated again 
at Mid year, that all VPs and MDs need to have attended this programme by end 
of year 2000. Their attendance does form part of the discussions on the VPs 
and MDs at the executive PRC.

Despite repeated comms from the OTC, these 37 names have not yet enrolled (or 
cancelled off a programme and have not re-enrolled). 

HR has committed to making sure that these people are enrolled, so the 
suggestion is that the named HR rep in the attachment takes 5 minutes to meet 
with the individuals, explain that they need to do this, show them the list 
of dates, and get them to choose which programme they want to enrol on. 
Please do not leave that meeting without a date! A word of caution, it is 
remotely possible that some of these individuals may have enrolled in the 
very recent past, or have attended and this data not yet reached Dick's 
spreadsheet, so do double check that they haven't yet enrolled before 
twisting their arms..

The dates for the remaining programmes are also on the spreadsheet.

To enrol a VP or MD,  get their dates, give it to their assistants and tell 
them to directly contact Debbie Nowak on 33304.

Tim

Subject: PRC

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

Dave,

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO - what's next?  

I am working with Bryan and Ray on the transition, everything seems to be 
going along smoothly.  Bryan is comfortable with me moving as soon as EBS has 
physical space for me as long as I am available to him by phone.  I expect to 
move next week.

I am working on a scheme with Wes on marking the swaps on Garden State 
without fair valuing the asset.  Citibank and National Bank of Canada are 
interested, and the trade should improve the economics as a result of trading 
with a strong credit (bank) as opposed to a stand alone operation (Garden 
State).  I should have more feedback by the end of the week.

Thank you for your support on my move to EBS.  I have really enjoyed working 
with you and appreciate what you have done for me.  Working with you, Greg 
and Rodney has really improved my management, finance and structuring skills 
that I expect to apply at EBS.

Call me if there is anything I can ever to do to support you.  I look forward 
to working with you again.  

Thanks for being a terrific boss and good friend.

Regards,

Edward

Subject: Ontario NUG Contract Management

Dave/John, we have been awarded the RFP to assume the role of contract 
manager for the Ontario NUG's (some 1700 MW's) for a 3 year term. A 
definitive agmt will  be executed by the end of November. This was a 
high-profile RFP and I think that it confirms our investment in positioning 
ourselves in Ontario.

This was truly a team effort (east/west orig, east trading, legal, 
regulatory) in responding to the RFP with a ton of long days needed in a 
short time-frame. The response to RFP was structured to manage all risks and 
well thought out which ultimately led to our successful bid.

I attach an executive summary that gives further details. If you have any 
questions, please call myself, Paul or Eric.

Subject: Re: Retail in South America  

I will be in Houston next week and we can discuss if you want to.  The idea 
here was not to explain the retail product offering or any concern of 
dropping the ball, rather a one off download of where we currently stand in 
South America  and high level overview of  how to work together to keep 
everyone on the same sheet of music and not miss  a beat.  For instance, 
there is already a local staff in place to handle initial deal flow (which is 
already happening) that needs to benefit from Dan's systems and best 
practices, but which has already based what they are doing on how Dan 
operates.  We have always benefited from as much of Dan's and Marty's 
attention as we could get over the past year and a half as we set this up.   
By the same token we can't be competitive in this business in Brazil on a 
cost basis from Houston, so that is why we have formed local staff based on 
EES systems and practices, and hopefully some controls as we go forward.  It 
is late here and my assistant is gone but I think the meeting is already 
scheduled.  If you can't be there maybe we can backbrief you.

Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not 
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product 
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large 
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority 
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I 
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business 
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
Key points for discussion will be:

-brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
-brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
through wholesale
-discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
retail business a success:
 -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
 -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake


Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
involved present on the call/meeting.

Subject: SIEMENS/WESTINGHOUSE DISPUTES

Currently, Enron has several contractual disputes with Siemens/Westinghouse.  
These include:  $5-10MM lingering from Marmara; about $4-5MM on Puerto Rico; 
and maybe $1-3MM on the Gleason and Indiana Peakers.

In my meeting with Randy Zwirn yesterday, Randy suggested that I meet with 
him in an attempt to come to a global settlement on all the Enron disputes.  

I propose to do this.  I understand the strength of the contractual issues on 
each of these projects and I think I can close out the issues by optimizing 
the Enron leverage in one global settlement.  The process will take from 
30-60 days as both sides collect all contractual arguments.

I'll keep ENA informed.

Let me know if either of you object to this global type approach.

"","Jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current North American 
energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and 
determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or 
existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility 
levels.

  In particular, I think that Miller should take a look at coal gasification 
technologies, emissions technologies and DSM/efficiency technologies and how 
these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business.  As well, 
from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) 
IPP, E&P, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves 
and expectations.

Can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so - maybe it 
would help to go pick a few brains in various ENA orgs as part of your 
process.

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
""dumping ground"" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

""Affiliates"" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

""Asia Pacific Region"" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Subject: Peaker Schedules

From Mike Miller and Mitch Robinson

John -

After today's conference call regarding the peakers and after today's failed 
attempt to commercially dispatch two of the units at the Lincoln facility, we 
see the following action items that need immediate resolution in order to get 
the peakers back on schedule:

Lincoln:
1.  Discussion with GE at sufficiently high level to determine whether any GE 
units at any sites have ever made <9 ppm NOx with CO <25 ppm (M. Dobler has 
initiated this discussion with Michelle April of GE).
2.  A detailed plan of attack from GE to get the units within guarantee 
emission limits.
3.  Resolution of the HMI sluggish response issue complete with a plan of 
attack.  The units can be run, but are clearly not ready for commercial 
operation with the sluggish HMI.

Wheatland:
1.  A plan of attack from Westinghouse to correct the fuel valves (and/or 
nozzles) on units 1 and 2.  Currently, the units can not be run reliably at 
base load.
2.  Plan of attack and schedule to correct the vibrations on 1 & 2.
3.  A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls 
support (this comment also applies to Gleason); sharing Rutledge and PCD 
controls personnel is proving inadequate.
4.  Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to 
get answers.  A dedicated EE&CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office 
would help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Gleason also).

Gleason:
1.  A detailed schedule and plan of attack is needed for the compressor blade 
modifications on units 1&2.
2.  An on-site EE&CC representative is required to bird-dog the compressor 
blade seals modification.
3.  Verification from Westinghouse that the 12 day modification will not slip 
into 3 weeks is required (see item 1).
4.  Verification that the IGV's have been fully corrected is required.
5.  A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls 
support (this comment also applies to Wheatland); sharing Rutledge and PCD 
controls personnel is proving inadequate.
6.  Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to 
get answers.  A dedicated EE&CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office 
would help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Wheatland also).

Subject: Doyle Financial changes since Fall 99

Ronnie and Russell,

Attached find a revised financial model for the Doyle project.  The model 
contains the changes that have occurred since this model was last updated in 
the Fall of 1999.  While the model is lengthy, I will summarize the major 
differences in the project.

1).  Capital Cost Increases:

The project capital cost has increased from the original plan.  The increases 
are dur to the following changes from our initial budget:

a) Planned purchase of the neighbor's house  $   140,000
b) Added cost of the sewer line    $      59,000
c) Output bonus on the PDA for max 5 MW   $1,725,000
d) IDC increase from increase in interest rates  $   574,000
 Total       $2,498,000

2).  Total Output change from 342 MW to 351.6 MW.  This assumes that unit 1 
will test at 62.2 MW. (the same as units 2 & 3)

3).  Project Net Value Increases due to Output Increase:

Impact of the added plant output is very positive.  It increases cashflow and 
debt service coverage.  The net increase to Walton is an additional 
$2,568,000 in value.  Walton's NPV increased from $5,281,000 to $7,849,000.  
This NPV includes Walton's project returns, the cost of interest on equity, 
the cost and recovery of LTCTs, and the asset management fee.

If you have any question, please call.

Clay

Subject: Technical Risk Reports

Attached are first drafts of reports for Dave Delainey that detail assets 
that may or may not pose a technical risk for ENA. The current draft was 
developed with input from Wayne Mays, Mark Dobler and Andrea Reed.

I would be most appreciative if each of you would review these reports at 
your earliest convenience and respond back with your comments/updates.  
Please note:   In the Technical book dated 8/03 there are 2 tabs - Risk and 
No risk.

Dave has asked for this report to be updated monthly for inclusion in a 
reporting package for ENA's Office of the Chair.  After we are satisfied that 
this is the proper format and is all inclusive I will communicate a process 
for monthly updates.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

"Re: Basic","David, you may be getting to the nub here.  Ultimately, this is a lot more 
art than science.  It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision 
rule to manage this process.  I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, 
Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good 
trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of 
the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return 
assets (ROCE >25%).

This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that 
comes from this group.  As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from 
this group in each case.

Dave,

Your comments on the Basic DASH are well-taken.  We will clarify what RAC 
views as the current valuation of Basic as well as RAC's recommendation with 
respect to this divestiture and modify the DASH as quickly as possible.

Your comments prompted a question with regard to ENA's divestiture strategy.  
Is it correct to assume that if we use a typical market liquidity premium of 
30% (i.e., future divestiture proceeds are 70% of the expected terminal value 
at the divestiture date to account for potential changes in future market 
conditions) in a sale deferral scenario and this deferral results in a higher 
NPV at the RAC capital price than the proposed sale proceeds, ENA would elect 
to retain the asset?  Or should a higher than ""market"" capital price be 
assigned by RAC to these assets earmarked for divestiture?

Regards,

Dave

"Re: Calgary Flames ""Enron "" Sponsorship","Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?   If it 
is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable 
display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community

expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and

Rob, further to our conversation. I have had attached a couple of the notes 
recently sent to the PR group.  Historically, the expense for this 
advertising has been paid by the Houston. The overall expense item was not 
that large and Corp was paying because generally they were not supporting any 
other expense in Calgary and deemed this request reasonable.  If possible I 
would ask that you secure approval from Delainey with regards to the renewal 
of this item.



Needless to say, this Flame has been a flagship for Enron in the Hockey 
community and our association with the Flames ownership committee does not go 
unnoticed !

Please let me know if you need anything but our basic request is corporate 
approval to reimburse canada for the next 3 years @ approx. $ 50,000.00 
US/year. 

Thanks in advance, Barry

Barry -- While PR can approve the look and feel of the sign, the cost would 
have to be approved by ENA Chairman's office.  Generally, it has been my 
understanding that each commercial group pays for such marketing expenses 
from its own budget.  As I am no longer working in the PR group, it would be 
best if you contact the Chairman's office directly to present the business 
case and request expense approval.

Kal,  further to my previous e-mail. This note is to advise as to the final 
costs that will be associated with the renewal of the Enron sponsorship.

We have negotiated a 3 year deal with the Calgary Flames.  Can you please 
verify via e-mail that ECC will be reimbursed by ENA for this annual 
advertising expense.  Upon receipt of the invoice, we will process payment 
and coordinate this on your behalf. 

Nov 2000 - Nov 2001        $68,000 + 7 % Tax = $72,760. / $ 1.47 ( Currency 
).  Approx. $ 50,000.00 US/Year advertising expense. 

Invoicing for this up coming season will be in the next couple of months.  I 
will also coordinate the execution of all documents regarding legal 
liability, renewal rights etc.  

Thanks in advance. Barry

"2001 Pro Forma","Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's 
review and then detailed review with each team.

This workbook has a number of worksheets including:
 a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we 
own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC;
 b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay 
expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be 
offset by larger monetizations;
 c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external 
capital charges are added back to reach EBIT;
 d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget;
 e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT 
non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups 
and bonus/other comp;
 f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 
assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond;
 g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, 
assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then 
calculates a net capital and depreciation charge;
 h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no 
anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant 
investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are 
charged @ a blended rate of 9%.

Two action items:
 a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his 
comment and review &
 b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for 
distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of 
weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet 
(including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), 
leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would 
like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.

Subject: Austin Implementation


Dave, since the ENA power desk will be receiving 100% of all earnings related 
to the City of Austin capacity, it's only appropriate that any cost overruns 
will be sent directly to their P/L. There isn't anything that leads me to 
believe there will be overruns, but you know how that goes with NEPCO and I 
want to be very clear up front that if something should occur, I have no 
ability to offset the cost with other Austin earnings. 

I'd also like to set aside some time when we can talk thru several business 
items/issues. The teaser list is as follows:  continuing internal noise 
between the desks and origination groups related to deals and primarily the 
P/L split (any maybe a few solutions), the followup and status and 
recommendations on the global LNG business and ENA's interest (I've had 
meetings with Doug Rotenburg, Vince Kiminski, others, and new info from our 
Duke meeting), status of Chicago office, clarification on leftover items from 
Columbia acquisition last year, employee hiring/contracts,  etc.

Maybe we can get together this afternoon or tomorrow. How about the status of 
the FP&L meeting with Jim Broadhead?

Hey guys. I would like an outline of the City of Austin project as far as how 
this will be managed from ENA's standpoint. My understanding is that Jeff 
Keenan will be the Project Manager for ENA and will be entirely responsible 
for the implementation of all aspects to bring the plant to commercial 
operations. This would include schedule, permitting, interconnect agreements, 
managing NEPCO to the $88.3 million total cost, etc. Everyone needs to 
realize that this team will realize a true loss on any overruns above the 
$88.3 million. I've asked Tammy Shepherd to set up a budget, schedule and 
weekly distribution similarly to how we handled Doyle and the other projects. 
I'm assuming that this team is managing everything related to the Austin 
project and is accountable for its successful implementation. 

If we need to discuss anything related to the above, let me know.  Thanks.

be subordinate

3) PPA Covenant that their is a uniform package to all suppliers; no more

Dave,

Yes,  I've got these set up.

On a separate topic, I received a visit from D. Liebert (working for Dan L. 
on EE&CC) to discuss the memo I sent out on the Tech Services Group.    
During the discussion we identified several areas where EES' view diverges 
from the view in my memo that ENA will manage its own technical risk and will 
be supported by EE&CC.      Currently, EES is headed in the following 
direction:

1. EE&CC will manage all technical risk in Enron as part of a consolidated 
technical risk book. 
2. EE&CC will be the sign off on all DASH's with respect to technical risk.
3. EE&CC is still trying to work out how their services will be charged to 
the business units - not sure what ""cost"" is.

This central decision is (1.) above.  If EES is going to manage ENA's 
technical risk then the balance between managing engineering cost and 
managing technical risk will be eliminated.  Essentially we will be back to a 
ENA (origination) vs. EE&CC (construction) relationship where we argue about 
how much money they are spending and the amount of overhead that is included 
in their ""cost"".  Your thoughts on this?

We didn't draw any lines and agreed to keep discussing to make this work.  I 
would suggest that either I can meet with Dan L. to understand his views or 
that we have another joint meeting with you and Dan's team to resolve.

Regards,
Brian

Dave

Thanks for your September 25 email.  TVA is currently developing the numbers
we agreed to share in our meeting last week, but given the importance of
this effort, TVA is going to need additional time.  Trying to complete the
task by this afternoon did not prove feasible.  We can, however, have this
information ready by October 13.

I will give you a call to discuss a mutually satisfactory method for
exchanging the information.

Subject: Gleason #1

Verified that one blade broke off from the 7th stage of blades in the 
compressor.  The shrapnel caused unreparable damage to 3 additional blades.  
From the pictures, it appears that one of the damaged blades was close to 
breaking off, and likely would have caused much more significant damage to 
the compressor AND turbine.

We've begun the process of removing the damaged blades.  Westinghouse has the 
repair lead, and so far, is giving it the right level of attention.  My plant 
manager's driving the effort on the ground, but I have a compressor engineer 
that will be at the site tomorrow to serve as my eyes and ears so Pete can 
concentrate on keeping the other two units running.

Barring as-yet undiscovered damage (doubtful), my best guess is that we lose 
next week, but get the unit back for the week of 24 July.  This hinges on 
Westinghouse securing four replacement blades which they are scrambling to 
do.  All costs should fall on Westinghouse warranty.

I'm collecting the information we might need in order to file a business 
process interruption insurance claim, but based on my best-guess schedule, I 
don't expect to file the claim.

Mitch

This may sound redundant considering the exercise we just completed but 
please ask your respective groups what their needs are for FULL TIME ANALYSTS 
late this summer.  These Analysts will start in the business units on August 
1, 2000 and they will be allocated on a first come first serve basis.  Please 
respond back to me no later than Monday by 5:00pm.  Also, please inquire 
about your groups' needs for FULL TIME ASSOCIATES who will be available to 
the business units on September 1, 2000.  We will be needing that number 
also.  There are 94 Analyst  and 70 Associates that will be coming on board 
this summer. This is in addition to each of your groups' immediate needs.

"ARC","Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern 
Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain 
strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of 
this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory 
pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis 
markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward 
characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, 
there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA 
point of view.

The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  
The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  
the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, 
venture capital and the ""organizing group"" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he 
believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million 
of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to 
participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I 
believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other

When and how often do you want to golf ?  

Milly and I are up for playing every day. I am thinking Friday afternoon.  
Saturday afternoon, and Sunday am ( 10:00 or so ). 

There is a great golf course ( TPC @ Canyons ) that I am trying to get us

Subject: Re: california  

Dave --

To your direct question of should Enron take a more active role in supporting 
or nominating Board members, I agree fully.

I would add the following thoughts:

First, I think that Enron's key position in terms of ISO / RTO governance 
should be that Boards (or the leadership and staff of transmission providers) 
should be indifferent to the price at which the commodity trades.  ISOs and 
RTOs should only worry about transmission, not the price of the commodity 
they are transmitting.   Winning on this issue will be critical as RTOs are 
proposed throughout the country to meet Order 2000 obligations.   

Also, Enron needs to really go after FERC for abdicating its wholesale market 
authority to ISOs, especially ISOs like in California that are dominated by 
state political figures.  FERC is responsible for ensuring just and 
reasonable rates, not some stakeholder Board established by state 
legislation.  We need to argue strongly that FERC must take back this 
authority in the near term and utilize its administrative procedures to 
impose any market changes.  

Finally, given that it will be some period of time before there is truly a 
""financially indifferent"" transmission provider under Order 2000, Enron must 
take an active role in working within and through the Boards of the current 
ISOs.   A good example is the way that Dan Allegretti works within the 
NE-ISO.  These Boards and the ISOs are fundamentally political 
organizations.  Our representatives must take the time to get to know the 
people so that when key issues arise, we are able to influence the decisions.

Thanks, 

Jim

Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we 
managed the position in a very effective manner.

Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a 
necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, 
should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors 
on these boards?

Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti 
is putting plan in place.

Subject: Peaker Fee

EE&CC has forwarded the peaker fee ($9.1 MM) invoice to ENA (see at bottom).  
I have sent a return e-mail to Gavin Gaul and John Normand explaining that 
final approval of this invoice will be from you.  Amy and I are waiting for a 
better breakdown of overhead charges on acceleration change orders.  Once we 
have the overhead issue framed out, I would then battle the fee, especially 
on Wilton Center, on a packaged basis with the overhead charges.

As per the Wilton Center fee, I reviewed all of the e-mail rhetoric regarding 
who is to blame for the massive construction cost overruns.  EECC/NEPCO's 
cupbability lies in their insistance from day one that Wilton Center could 
and would be built non-union.  It was only after ENA forced the decision in 
late June 1999 to build the job union (to avoid air permit intervention) that 
EECC/NEPCO even began to deal with how to build the job in a union 
environment.  Even at that point, EECC/NEPCO would not move off of building 
the job on a cost reimbursable basis and did not properly consider other 
alternatives such as fixed unit pricing (fixed price per unit quantity 
installed).  EECC/NEPCO claimed that they did not have enough time to 
negotiate with the unionsor pursue other options.  However, because of their 
insistance to go non-union, they precluded the ability to negotiate until the 
decision to go union was made.  According to our labor experts, breaking off 
union site negotiations and building non-union is worse than just going 
non-union from the start.  In any event, if you need more detail on this 
subject prior to discussing the fee with Larry Izzo, please let me know and I 
will summarize the key points.

I will continue to work with Amy Spoede to tie down the remaining cost and 
overhead issues.  If you need me to do anything else, please let me know.

would help them not hurt them!).  I can attend if you want and give my Q1 
observations.  However, if you think you have it handled, that is OK for me 
as well.  I am not emotional about it either way and am only concerned about 
helping if you need it or want it.  That is why Kay asked you about it today.

Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.



Regards
Dave and John

thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels 
and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the 
future vision for power and the overall organization including gas 
mid-market.  

Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to 
manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself 
the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the 
primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.

Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.

Subject: Great words


David,  

I hope all is well.  I had another good week at pulp and paper.  As you know 
I have an affinity for technology trading.  I thought you would enjoy the 
fine words below as you start a new week.  

Time is your most precious possession-and the hands of time move swiftly 
onward.  Fasten this warning deep into your mind, not for sorrow,s sake, but 
to remind yourself that today may be all you have.  Now is the time for you 
to move forward. Now is the time for you to stand and be counted.  The ground 
is now ready for you to plant the seeds of a new vision, one that will bear 
only the finest fruit.  It is time to focus on what you want, to turn dreams 
into realities so that you are able to spend your life in the manner in which 
you desire.  It is later than you think.    Too many of us waste our years 
waiting for better times in the future or reflecting upon better times in the 
past, instead of working for better times in the present.  --------------- If 
only we had better schooling, better opportunities, or better resources. 
If,if,if!  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow!  
-------------------------------------

Today is always here; yesterday is gone; and tomorrow never comes.  Time 
offers opportunity but demands a sense of urgency.  Now is the time.  This is 
the place.  You are the one!

Those who leave a legacy of achievement master the art of living in the now- 
the ability to make each moment count.  Here are their tips.

? First, they accept each moment as a gift to be received with joy.
? Second, they use each moment to maximum advantage.
? Third, they are bent on making a contribution to humanity.
? Fourth, they learn from their mistakes.
? Fifth, they concentrate on the task at hand.
? Sixth, they plan for the future rather than fretting over the past.
? Seventh, they simply refuse to allow the weight of an unpleasant 
circumstance to encumber their thoughts or objectives.

                                                                              
               Dennis P. Kimbroa

I think technology is made up of a number of tradable commodities.  These 
commodities are volatile and trading them will add value to ENA.  I would 
like the opportunity to create this group.

Best wishes,

M. A. Moulton

"""The Pulse"" Employee Survey","Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to 
reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups 
and managers have very low participation rates.

I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% 
participation (ie) the ""unhappy"" folks are more likely to input info than the 
""happy"" folks.

Subject: ""The Pulse"" Employee Survey

""The Pulse"" is the new name for the employee survey -- formerly known as 
Excellence Through Communication.  It is scheduled to rollout on Monday, 
October 16.  In an effort to boost participation, I would like to ask for 
your assistance in spreading the word to your direct reports at your staff 
meeting.  They should, in turn, encourage their direct reports to 
participate.  Last year, ENA's participation rate was approximately 50% and 
our goal for this year is 60%.

The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete and can be 
done electronically.  The topics covered are:

 1) What are the obstacles to performance and effectiveness?
 2) What things hinder job satisfaction and fulfillment?
 3) What more can be done to make Enron the best place to work?

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 3-9053.  
Thanks.

It turns out that Delainey agreed to allow Brett Wiggs to be the Enron 
spokesperson.   I guess we'll give the current process another week or so.   
I'm personally not in love with the Mitsubishi turbines anyway given the NOx 
uncertainty.

"Wind Info/Cost to Build","Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.  There appears to be 
one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the 
development road.  If interested in these projects, which have to meet a 
December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we 
purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the 
asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA.  
They are Ok with that strategy.  This is an opportuntity that needs to 
fleshed out fairly quickly - Ben and Dave can you lead this analysis with 
close contact with Doug and Tim on the desk.  We can get together to discuss 
if you like.

Subject: Coal Fired Generation

Dave

In response to your e mail, this is meant to update you on the status of the 
search for potential coal fired generation sites.

We have used the following criteria to screen potential sites east of the 
Mississippi including the following:

 Underutilized existing coal fired generation (15 sites)
 Existing coal fired generation that is on cold stand by (12 sites)
 Coal units that have been retired (20 sites)
 Coal fired units that at one time had planned coal unit additions that were 
delayed or cancelled (11 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build coal units (13 sites)
 Undeveloped sites that had planned to build nuclear units (5 sites)

We are in the process of prioritizing each site based on infrastructure, 
transmission access, market and permit status. That effort should be 
concluded this week and the study forwarded to you. We are also talking with 
two coal operators that are in the process of developing their own coal fired 
generation in Kentucky and West Virginia.

We will keep you apprised of the progress and meet with you again as we move 
to the next stage.

"Draft organizational memo","Ray, couple of comments:
 a) Donahue is responsible for the portfolio management function but also 
incorporate the idea of Jeff being responsible for ENA's ""capital book"" (ie) 
managing existing deals and intimately involved in conjunction with Treasury 
and the various origination groups of which finance transactions get or don't 
get on our books;
 b) Has Fastow clearly put Defner in the ENA Treasurer role? - if so we 
should also mention this in the note;
 c) Chuck Ward ( Generation Investments); Don Miller ( Merchant Generation);
 and d) with regard to commodity structuring ensure it is clear that they 
will facilitate and structure the highest priority/value transactions across 
the organization even though they report to Janet (ie) they don't just work 
on East Origination deals.

Let me see the final before release. Make sure Mark is on side.

As a shareholder I am extremely happy that you are heading over to EES.  
There is a business there.  They just need some help with the execution and 
implementation.  

I'm sorry to see you leave ENA.  The management style that you and John have 
brought to this organization is the best I've seen.  The attention to details 
and teamwork are really impressive.  Personally, I want to say thanks for all 
of the support that you have provided to me and the West Power Team over the 
last year.  Everything from acknowledging our suceessful business model to 
helping us to refine it through improved metrics in the middle market to 
supporting me and my guys through the PRC process has been greatly 
appreciated!

With EES' large position in the west I'm sure we will be working together in 
the future.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do to help.  Good 
luck.

Regards,
Tim

One thing I forgot to mention is that if we do give Mexico mid market to 
Craig, we need to set up the organization out of Houston, (I think).  Max has 
been interviewing candidates for mid market positions there, and I would like 
those guys to report to Craig.  Is Max with us?  Jeff

Folks:

The attached RFP for peaking power may be of interest. I believe the RFP is 
restricted to those parties having control of generation assets in TVA or 
Southern. Our consultant, Gary Hasty (former TVA), can gather additional if 
you like.

Hi Dave,
Thanks for agreeing to participate in Super Saturday.  Unfortunately, I gave 
you the wrong date.  I think I told you December 9th and it should have been 
December 2nd.  I hope that is still OK.  We are still looking for someone to 
do the first one which is October 28th.  I think it would be great if someone 
at your level could start it off to send a message.  However, I won't get 
greedy  I will take what I can get (smile). Just let me know.

With respect to the straw man, I have worked on it but it is not complete.  
Celeste was scheduled to be here this week but has been put on bed rest by 
her doctor and has had to leave a week early.  I am trying to work with her 
recruiters who are in the middle of campus presentations, etc.  I will finish 
working on it this weekend and we can meet on Tuesday.  I will call Kay and 
get on your schedule.   I will try to get you a draft prior to our meeting 
(by Monday) so you can review it before hand.
Thanks Charlene

"SAP Implementation","By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, 
our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) 
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a 
success.


Sincerely,


Dave

Subject: Resume for Fundamentals Group-Gas Business

Dave-

Thank you for taking the time last week to speak at the floor meeting on 29.
I come from an engineering background and work in a financial reporting role 
for Andrea Reed.
I have found the transition from engineering to finance at Enron a natural 
one with my eye on details and
the analysis process.

I have attached Gwen Weddington's resume which I would like to pass on to the 
Fundamentals Group for the Gas Business,
which you mentioned is now being formed.
I think that she could be a valuable addition to Enron.
She is currently an Operations Manager at Air Products and Chemicals' 
Industrial Chemicals Group.

Can you tell me to whom I should forward this?

Thanks,

Carol
3-4291

Enron
Houston, TX

Dear Carol:

I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday.  As I mentioned,
I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air
Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read
about Enron.  Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who
might be kind enough to ""keep their eyes open"" and share thoughts and ideas
as to companies I should contact.

I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.  As
you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong
operations background.  I would certainly enjoy another position as an
Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.
I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of
industries.  Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be
very encouraging.  I am open to any avenues you suggest.

Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.  It
seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select
introductions.  Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who
can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.  The more contacts I
make, the more opportunities I can uncover.

If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.  I will contact you
again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.  Thank you in advance for your
help.

Sincerely,


Gwen Weddington

Subject: End of Year Bonus

--  PLEASE DISREGARD IF YOU RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM ME ON 1-9-01 (I was 
having trouble with the network in Houston)

Dave,

The attached spreadsheet outlines my recommendations on proposed changes to 
the bonus distribution.

In regard to my expectations, I am expecting a significant increase from last 
years bonus for the following reason.

It was my strategic decision to:
pursue the asset development business in conjunction with other business 
lines (made and received approval to hire the necessary people and execute 
the strategy from Kevin Hannon).
close both Wind and Powder projects simultaneously versus only focus on the 
Powder River Project (know one thought that both could get done in a 7 week 
time frame. At the risk of not being able to get either closed, I went out on 
the limb and sent Whitt to negotiate and close Wind River ($72 MM) while I 
negotiated and closed Powder River ($75 MM).
it was my idea to create Enron Midstream Services and develop a gathering 
business in the Powder. That decision enable us to hedge our firm transport 
decision on Fort Union and enabled us to receive $54 million for the sale of 
the business
I made the  call and initiated the joint bid between Northern Border and ENA 
to acquire a combined 49% interest in Bighorn Gas Gathering.  We sold our 
interest to NBP for $22 MM
I initiated the discussions, structured the transaction, negotiated the value 
and closed Project 20/20 with NBP.  There was a point in the negotiations 
where it was known that I was going with NBP and therefore had to take a 
neutral position.  However, by that time, the value had been established and 
many contentious issues regarding valuation had been agreed upon
it was my call to preserve value in the transaction and have myself and a 
team of 12 others go over to NBP versus have them deduct the cost associated 
with a Management Services Agreement from the purchase price.  This saved ENA 
over $20 MM in value.  Needless to say, we are now having to deal with 
managing a highly aggressive budget and adjust to a very different management 
style and compensation plan. I feel personally that ENA was the primary 
beneficiary of the higher valuation.  As you can appreciate, I have a 
personal issue with this and would like this to be considered for bonus 
determination.

In general, I think Project 20/20 was just part of my contribution to ENA 
during my tenure in Denver.  In total, this office has generated in excess of 
$150 million in earnings with no remaining risk potential.  I have been 
fortunate to have hired a solid team that approached many of the projects we 
worked on in a team manner.  I think that approach has been successful and I 
am hopeful that major contributors on the team will be compensated 
appropriately.

I appreciate your consideration Dave!  Please let me know if you have any 
questions or thoughts regarding this e-mail.

Brian

Subject: Merrill Lynch Offer - Termination of Midwest Peaking Trade

Dave,

The Bid Offer is now officially at $0 - $17MM - See below offer from Merrill.

Below is the response from Dan Gordon who was my counterpart at Merrill after 
my discussion with him where I told him I wanted to just terminate the trade 
without paying any fees.  I had asked Dan to come up with a number they would 
think appropriate for terminating the trade.  I also discussed the deal with 
their relationship officer Robert Furst so they are all engaged.  I think Dan 
is simply trying to elicit a higher first bid from us without him doing any 
work or potentially leaving any money on the table since it is us that wants 
to unwind the trade.

I have Rogers Herndon pulling some information on how much the position has 
moved since we did the deal.  I also have him working through what we would 
have done if we owned the deal i.e. how much gas basis risk we would have 
mitigated and what the value would be now as well and any other hedges we 
would have put on and the value of them now.  This will give us information 
to either negotiate or at least get a better picture of what a better offer 
should be.  I have also notified Elizabeth Sager, our lawyer, to dig back in 
and get back up to speed on the deal to prepare to discuss it.  

As I see it our options are: 

Option 1:  Negotiate
Rogers/Kevin/Myself go to NY and negotiate/highlight the risks in the deal 
with ML

Option 2: Relationship Play
Either myself or Cliff start leaning on the relationship people at ML to 
force ML into a more realistic first offer.  

Let me know your thoughts on how you want to proceed.
Rodney

Subject: Merrill Lynch Offer - Termination of Midwest Peaking Trade



Rodney-

Merrill Lynch has reviewed the transaction that was executed with Enron in
December, 1999 involving physically and financially settled call options on
certain mid-continent peakers owned by Enron.  At that time, a fee of
approximately $17 million was charged to execute the transaction.

Since the execution of the trade, Merrill Lynch has had to manage the risk
associated with the sizeable position as well as hedge certain gas basis
risks that Merrill Lynch was obligated to assume in order to accommodate the
accounting treatment desired by Enron as part of the transaction.
Additionally, as I am sure that you and your traders are aware, the position
has considerably appreciated in value since trade execution.

Even with these factors, Merrill Lynch is prepared to accommodate Enron's
request to terminate the transaction in exchange for a fee of $17 million.
This fee encompasses the original fee that Enron had agreed to pay to
Merrill Lynch and does not take into consideration any of Merrill Lynch's
hedge breakage costs or our foregone upside in the trade.

Should you wish to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Regards, as always.

Dan Gordon

Subject: Future GE forecast - John Schroeder

Need input if anyone thinks we need more turbines than John Schroeder/GE has 
forecasted.  My gut feel is that John has forecasted more turbines than we 
will need (which is OK).  

The GE planning Boys called John and asked him to check with Enron....... and 
determine if Enron wanted any turbines in the 2002/2003 timeframe (the 
previous assumption being 7F's wouldn't be available till 4Q03, and 7EA's 
wouldn't be available till 1Q03).  John stated that he didn't know what the 
request from Schenectady meant....., but....., maybe a few production slots 
were coming available as things shake out.....  John told them that he 
thought Enron might be interested in:

qty 4 7EA's and qty 4 7F's for ESA
qty 2 7EA's and qty 2 7F's for Mexico
qty 6 7EA's and qty 6 7F's for NA

John is asking us........, ""that would be enough...... right?"".  We don't 
need to change that input (from John Schroeder to Schenectady) if we want 
less than he forecasted, but....., if someone knows something I don't, 
and....., we would want more turbines than the above......., please let us 
know.  

On an immediate basis, John also stated that he had requests in for turbines 
for Saudi, and....., ""an island project"".

Dave,

As part of my ongoing effort to maintain a high level of morale within the 
group, I would like to undertake a couple of outings during the first half of 
the year.  Given the fact that I now report to you directly and these outings 
will involve spending some money, I don't want to commit to anything before 
reaching agreement with you on the following:

Weekend offsite in Galveston (at Hotel Galvez) in April.  Group dinner on 
Friday, Golf at Galveston Country Club on Saturday morning, meetings and 
beach time during afternoon/evening on Saturday, group deep sea fishing 
outing on Sunday.  Given that the capacity of the boat exceeds the number of 
people in my group, I intend to invite one or more other groups from ENA as a 
way of fostering better communications.  Total cost of the entire weekend 
should not exceed $15,000.00.

Team building exercise on Mt. Hood (Oregon) in July.  Despite my present 
residence in Houston, I previously lived for many years in Europe, including 
4+ years in Switzerland.  During this time, I became an avid mountain 
climber.  I would like to take as many member of my group as are willing to 
climb Mt. Hood (which I have climbed several times - not a huge challenge).  
Given Mt. Hood's proximity to Portland, I would of course combine this with 
half a day spent with Chris Calger and his group (and may even invite them to 
accompany us).  Total cost would be around $450 per person plus 
transportation. 

I would like to go ahead and finalize arrangements for the above unless you 
have strenuous objections.  Please let me know.

Dave, 

We will either: 

1. Find an acceptable structure for the LIPA PPA (unit contingent - no 
replacement energy risk) and complete the transaction.   LIPA is aware of our 
issues and is considering how they want to proceed.
2. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to LIPA - probably the 
best case scenario.
3. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to ConEd, Morgan 
Stanley, AES or NRG (we are now in the process of agreeing CAs with these 
parties with respect to an infor memo on the barges/deal), or
4. Let BargeCo keep the barges (technically they still own them now).

The time frame for resolving this is Q4.

Brian

Attached is a summary and the original reports from FERC Staff on Power 
Markets (Midwest, Southeast).  

Overall, these are good reports, but we are not sure where FERC will go now 
(especially with the outstanding Presidential election).  I'll keep you 
posted if anything begins to move.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Dave,

I know I should be generating money instead of spending it, but I would like 
your approval to spend $20K on four packages for this year's SuperBowl.  In 
lieu of a mass-market customer event, I would like to target certain decision 
makers that are involved in large transactions.  With that in mind, we would 
like to invite individuals from Black Hills (buyer of PSCo project), and 
either Avista or McCook Metals (buyer of Longview project).   Two Enron 
people (Parquet, Jake or I) would go with two executives.  In the past, West 
Power has signed up for 8+ packages - I have appropriately scaled it back, 
but I do think this type of selective client entertainment has value.

Regards,

Chris

Subject: Enron Direct Canada-First Deal

Harold;

We have today closed our first retail transaction that is a five year 
exclusive gas supply arrangement with Boardwalk Equities, the largest 
apartment building owner in Alberta.  We will be serving 20,000 apartment 
suites with an annual consumption of 1.5 bcf.  The 5 year margin will be 
approximately $1.5 million.  As a result of our direct instructions, 
Boardwalk lobbied the government to provide them with $2.8 million dollars in 
rebates over the next 4 months to shield them from the higher gas prices.  
These rebates will be paid through Enron Direct as the retailer for Boardwalk.

The gas begins flow on March 1.  We are working on other large building 
owners and restaurant chains and expect to close 2 or 3 more deals for flow 
of March 1. Cadillac Fairview is committed to working with us on a gas 
contract within the next 2 weeks.   We now have a strong platform to grow 
quickly, from a standing start one month ago.

Although the government effectively delayed the opening of the retail power 
market for one year through a price cap, we have been able to grasp a first 
mover advantage on retailing natural gas in Alberta.  We expect to have a 
strong retail delivery organization built by mid year, with 35 staff managing 
a significant number of commercial customers.

The current pricing environment creates a large opportunity to sell 5 year 
fixed price product with significant margins.  Atco, the gas utility is 
getting bad press for not offering hedging instruments, and are cooperating 
with us to assist us in getting established as a retailer.  

This has been a very large effort in the last month, as we needed to get 
licensed, and get legal agreements in place where there were no precedents to 
look at.  We are excited at the prospects for a substantial business 
developing very quickly here in Alberta.  The Enron Canada analytical, risk 
management, regulatory and legal staff have provided great assistance to 
allow us to execute this transaction in a short period.

Regards.

Dave

Dave,

Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more 
important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas 
organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and 
resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications 
(if any) it might be worth discussing.

Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron

any new opportunities that come about.

Thanks!

Re: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec 
Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff Below VP into ENA

Effective immediately we have asked the ENA HR department to implement the 
following changes to procedures to assist us in managing these two very 
important processes, more consistently and effectively:

Hiring of all Commercial Managers or Directors (VP process will remain as is)
Business Unit leads and MD's will remain responsible for developing and 
pursuing speculative talent for their groups and, within their budgets, will 
also remain responsible for managing their overall headcount.
The HR department will continue to support this effort by focusing on 
providing each of you with a flow of speculative resumes which you should 
spend time each week reviewing and providing feedback on so that this 
pipeline can be refined and better targeted.
The interviewing process for all Commercial Managers and Directors should be 
very rigorous and should include at least 2 interviews by VP's in addition to 
the sponsoring Business Unit lead plus a minimum of 3 senior individuals 
within the sponsoring group (ie total of 6 in most cases).
Effective immediately, once the sponsoring group lead has completed their 
interviewing process and would like to extend an offer of employment, the 
candidate must be interviewed by the ENA OTC, before an offer of employment 
will be released by the HR department. No candidates should be referred to 
the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and 
resolved  ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the 
candidate.
Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be 
contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be 
managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary.
John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which 
will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out 
of town, these will be conducted via telephone.

Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial Staff
Effective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive 
Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows:
For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing 
Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John 
Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail 
and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) 
Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason 
or justification for offering them a contract.
In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead 
or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction.
Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, 
your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft 
financial terms on the familiar contract request form.
Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial 
terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in 
the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps 
described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail.
Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a 
fresh draft will be produced.

The following HR Representatives will assist you with these new procedures:

Utilities Secretly Lobbied Congress; Electric Firms Gave Millions to
Left and Right to Halt Deregulation
John Mintz

05/11/2000
The Washington Post
FINAL
A01
Copyright 2000, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

  Some of the nation's largest electric utilities have secretly
funneled millions of dollars through two front groups--one headed by
well-known conservative leaders to appeal to Republicans, the other
affiliated with unions--to stop Congress from deregulating their
industry.

  The campaign, which at times was run out of the offices of the
utilities' CEOs, was so secret that some Washington lobbyists for
these same companies were kept in the dark about many of its
activities, according to documents stamped ""confidential"" by the
effort's organizers.
  The documents offer an inside view of the industry's
clandestine efforts to wage its political battle through newly minted
entities with innocuous-sounding names. While the use of such groups
has become a common device in lobbying campaigns, it is rare to obtain
a detailed operator's manual for such an effort, complete with candid
assessments of individual lawmakers' vulnerabilities and specific
budgets for waging grass-roots campaigns in their districts.

  Although the two groups--the conservative Citizens for State
Power and the liberal Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance--have
advertised heavily against deregulation, until now only those involved
in the effort knew the organizations were the creation of the same
network of utilities. This network believed using seemingly
independent surrogates made their case more believable and shielded
them from political risk.

  A 1998 memo said the utilities ran the groups in an
arm's-length way described as ""discreet, guarded and highly
confidential. . . . Fear of congressional reprisals conditioned this
style. . . . It would be prudent to avoid rash openness.""

  Their ongoing ""grass roots"" lobbying campaign was designed to
influence members of Congress by whipping up hometown ferment with
radio ads directing listeners to call ""1-800-BAD-BILL"" and telephone
banks wired to connect angry home district residents to congressional
offices.

  The goal of the operation, on which the utilities spent $17
million over the last 3 1/2 years, was to bottle up legislation in a
single congressional panel, the House Commerce Committee's energy and
power subcommittee.

  The utilities' stealth campaign is one reason energy
deregulation legislation has been stalled, although last fall one
partial deregulation bill was reported to the full committee. Commerce
Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) is a staunch industry critic
determined to move a bill.

  The documents describe meetings in Washington steak houses such
as Sam & Harry's where utility lobbyists and consultants shaped
strategies for stopping Bliley. The dozen or so participants in the
operation--who called their effort ""The Project""--address each other
in the memos with the kind of blunt talk that isn't often found in
civics textbooks.

  ""The trendline is ominous in that a spirit of accommodation and
compromise is definitely taking hold,"" said one document in 1998, when
the utilities feared Bliley was winning over committee colleagues.
""The number one goal of 'The Project' has always been to bottleneck
legislation.""

  The participants speak of the need to ""demonize"" the federal
agency that regulates utilities and to use debates about nuclear power
as ""a highly provocative wedge issue"" to destabilize legislative
adversaries.

  The memos were given to The Washington Post by deregulation
advocates, and participants in ""The Project"" confirmed their
authenticity.

  The effort has outraged some congressional advocates of power
deregulation. Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.)--whom the conservative
front group, Citizens for State Power, attacked in home district radio
ads last year--said it is ""bogus"" for a group to claim the
conservative mantle by protecting big utilities.

  ""They're wearing a conservative hat, but they ought to be
wearing a profit-making hat,"" said Largent. ""The best interest of
conservatives is to create competition.""

  Citizens for State Power (CSP) is headed by two leading lights
of the conservative movement--anti-tax and Republican activist Grover
Norquist, and David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative
Union--and is run day-to-day by a veteran GOP operative, Craig
Shirley. It denied for years that it took industry funds, but in
recent years acknowledged taking some such money while offering no
details.

  The Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance (EUSA) also was
created by utility funds, with the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers kicking in small sums. It acknowledged some of its
utility backers a few years ago but uses populist language to argue
that federal deregulation would cause layoffs and hurt mom-and-pop
utility shareholders.

  The documents detail how the Washington political consultants
who run ""The Project"" call into action one or another of these two
groups depending on circumstances. They used the right-leaning CSP to
broadcast ads criticizing Largent in his conservative Tulsa district
and employed the more liberal EUSA to air commercials against Rep.
Rick White (R-Wash.), who a year later lost his seat representing a
more moderate Seattle district.

  In its effort to stymie federal deregulation, ""The Project"" at
times argued both sides of an issue before different audiences. Its
participants told environmentally minded legislators that various
deregulation bills weren't aggressive enough in reducing utility
pollution but dispatched others to argue to pro-business members that
Congress should not threaten deep emissions cuts.

  While energy deregulation is an arcane concept to the public,
it is an extraordinarily high-stakes struggle for the nation's $300
billion-a-year power industry. The battle pits investor-owned
utilities against large manufacturers that want cheap power and
independent power companies, such as Enron Corp., that want to compete
with utilities. For one House Commerce subcommittee markup last year,
lobbying firms paid temp workers to wait in line outside the hearing
room for two days so the firms would have seats at the markup.

  Most investor-owned utilities don't want the federal government
to deregulate their businesses and introduce competition. These
utilities say that if need be, they prefer that state legislatures and
state utilities commissions do the job because they are less
heavy-handed than federal officials. So far 26 states have taken the
step.

  Deregulation advocates say that the state efforts result in a
confusing regulatory checkerboard and that federal action would lower
energy prices and encourage investment in clean energy sources.

  Many top GOP leaders were eager to deregulate utilities when
they took over Congress in 1995, seeing it as a test of a bedrock
conservative principle: opening the marketplace to competition.

  Within months, a group of utilities sprang into action,
organized by a law firm with a thriving utility practice. The firm,
which now goes by the name Ryan, Phillips, Utrecht & MacKinnon,
enlisted several existing clients and, later, numerous other firms.

  Soon, the firm had brought in nine utilities that paid from
$300,000 to $700,000 a year to fund ""The Project"" during the years
they participated. The main corporate participants, the documents
said, were Carolina Power & Light, Florida Power & Light, Texas
Utilities, Illinois-based Commonwealth Edison, Reliant Energy
(formerly called Houston Industries), Ohio-based First Energy,
Michigan-based Consumers Energy, Florida-based TECO and Union Electric
Co. in Missouri.

  ""The Project"" was run by law firm partner Jeffrey MacKinnon, a
former top aide to Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the House
subcommittee; and Tim Ridley, a former Democratic staff member in
Congress who now runs a firm specializing in ""grass roots"" lobbying
campaigns.

  They and the utilities ran the two front groups and supervised
more than 50 ""mobilizations"" in congressional districts, in which
radio aids were aired. Banks of trained telephone operators arranged
for home district residents to send telegrams or place calls to
congressional offices. The groups also arranged for influential
citizens in the members' home towns to spread their message--including
the car dealers who sold members their cars.

  While most of the ads were not particularly negative, others
used sarcasm or debatable statistics to attack their targets.

  The one broadcast against Largent said he was favoring ""Boston,
bureaucrats and biomass"" because the House member had joined with Rep.
Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a measure that industry officials said
could have required utilities to use alternative energy sources. A
memo from late 1998, six months before the campaign, gave a taste of
the utilities' displeasure with him, describing the firms as ""highly
alarmed by Largent's obtuseness"" and noting they ""could make Largent's
life very uncomfortable.""  Some congressional Republicans hold Citizens
for State Power
partially responsible for defeating White, who lost his swing seat to
a Democrat, Jay Inslee. A year before the November 1998 election, the
group aired an ad saying White wanted to raise utility rates by 35
percent, and it also circulated a poll and memo among political
professionals showing that White would be beaten easily, in part
because of his embrace of deregulation.

  ""For the first time in this debate there were palpable
political consequences for appearing to support"" deregulation, a June
1998 document said. ""In the case of Rick White, those consequences
were direct and career threatening.""

  White said he doubted the ads played much role in his defeat,
but he recalls his unease at realizing a GOP group was targeting him.

  ""I was a loyal member of the Republican cause, and this was a
case of shooting a friend in the foot,"" he said.

Joe, I would appreciate a quick call by you to Larry to ensure that his 
organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line ASAP.  We 
still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed.  I 
believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to 
emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement.

Thanks.

Subject: Mid-year 2000 Performance Review Process

As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention 
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a 
number of important tasks and projects in process.  While recognizing this, 
it remains extremely important to take time over the next few weeks to gather 
necessary information to provide quality and meaningful feedback for our 
employees, as well as utilize this information during the year end review 
process.

In the spirit of One Enron, the Performance Review Process (PRC) will be 
global for Mid-year 2000.  Vice Presidents and above across all operating 
companies will be reviewed and discussed in a consistent manner with 
identical criteria.   ENA will review all professional level and above 
employees.  The timeline and training for the midyear process are outlined at 
the end of this memo.  Your HR Business Consultant is also available to 
answer questions.

With regards to the Global Functions, review sessions will be led by the 
Global and/or Corporate Functional heads, and will be designed to calibrate 
personnel within these areas of expertise.  The Global Functional Review 
Areas include:

_ NetWorks/Technology
_ Accounting
_ RAC
_ Finance
_ Human Resources
_ Public Relations & Reg Affairs	G. Whalley
	R. Causey
	R.  Buy
	A. Fastow
	C. Olson
	S. Kean
       
ENA Mid-Year Process:

ENA has received favorable feedback on the review process used for Mid-year 
and Year-end 1999, and as such, will follow the same general guidelines and 
process for Mid-year 2000.  The following are key features of the Mid-year 
2000 process:

o The focus of the feedback will continue to be on the qualitative aspects, 
as opposed to quantitative.  Toward this end, communication of the employee,s 
explicit ranking will be left to the discretion of the business unit manager.
o Initial discussions with employees regarding their accomplishments, are 
highly encouraged, prior to the Business Review Meetings.
o Mid-year performance results will be used as baseline performance 
information for Year-end 2000.
o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups.  
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale.  
o All exempt employees will be discussed at Business Review Meetings and 
placed into one of six categories by peer group.  ENA VP's will be pre-ranked 
by the ENA Office of the Chairman and Managing Directors prior to the Enron 
PRC.  Non-exempt (overtime eligible) employees will be evaluated by their 
supervisors and placed into one of the 6 categories.  The results of the 
Business Review Meetings will be the final rankings for exempt employees 
below VP, subject to ENA Office of the Chairman.
o A minimum of two representatives from other functional areas will be 
required at the Business Review Meetings.  The meetings should otherwise be 
rescheduled to allow this very important representation to take place.  The 
nominated individuals are illustrated below.
o The top 5 HR priorities/challenges for 2000 should also be agreed to at the 
Business Review Meetings.
o Analysts and Associates will be pre-reviewed in a Business Review Meetings 
based on their current rotation, then cross-calibrated at the Enron Global 
Analyst and Associate Business Review Meeting.

Peer Groups:

 Commercial
 Commercial Support
 Technical
 Specialized Technical

Performance Criteria (for all peer groups):

Innovation/Entrepreneurship
Communication/Setting Direction
Teamwork/Interpersonal
Leadership/Vision/Values 
Business Instinct
Analytical/Technical

Guidelines:

o Use of multiple sources of input is encouraged (employee, peers, direct 
reports, internal customers, external customers), as is a self-evaluation
o Employees should recommend 5-10 reviewers to Supervisor and Supervisor 
should select at least three of the employee,s recommendations
o All feedback must be entered via the Performance Management System located 
on the intranet
o Supervisor should consolidate the feedback, prepare a draft of the 
Performance Review form and meet with the employee prior to the Business 
Review meeting
o Final feedback to exempt employee follows the July 28th meeting
o For VP's & MD's, final feedback follows the Enron Executive Committee 
Meeting

Responsibilities / Actions:

The following list represents suggested groups and the individuals 
responsible for each Business Review Meeting.  Attendees at the meetings are

Subject: Re: LIPA  

Dave:

Status of the 6Bs:  Enron Nigeria has sent us $7.1MM for the two turbines.  
We have an agreed turbine purchase contract that we have executed and that 
Enron Nigeria are supposed to execute today.  Per our discussion, Wes C.  
suggested that we push the $2.0MM additional write down as well as the $7.1 
turbine purchase revenue to Q4.

Status of LIPA/Barges:   We are working in two directions.  Currently, we 
are:  

1. Finding a buyer for either the LIPA PPA/Barges together, or just the 
barges by themselves
2. Discussing with LIPA, the Power Desk, and BargeCo to find an acceptable 
PPA structure and barge price to meet our risk/return criteria.

The decision tree for the LIPA deal is as follows:

IF: The LIPA PPA can be structured to be unit contingent for energy,
   AND: The power desk can get comfortable with the capacity availability 
risk (discussions ongoing)
   AND: The economics of the deal are acceptable given the price for 
replacement capacity charged by the desk.
   AND: All permitting issues are either resolved or resolvable

OR,

IF: We can find an ""as-is, where-is"" buyer for the Barges with/without the 
PPA (ConEd, Montauk, NRG)

THEN: 
 ENA will purchase the barges from BargeCo (Barges are currently located in 
Brooklyn) 

ELSE: 
 We will not purchase the barges and will shut down the LIPA deal.    

 1. LIPA:  We will fall back on permitting issues and schedule to as a reason 
to stop working on the deal.

2. BargeCo:  The barges will have a lower performance than what was 
originally stated by BargeCo.  Additional capital investment would be 
required to meet our performance requirements - our position is that this 
additional cost must be borne by BargeCo.  We do not, however, want to 
implement this action until we have sold the 6B turbines to Enron Nigeria so 
that we are sure this transaction is completed.

Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My 
understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I 
may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) 
no more 6B's or barges.

Subject: Ontario Update

Dave, I didnt get a chance to talk to you during your meeting but thought I 
should make you aware of the following. Unfortunately, we have experienced a 
bit of a set-back re Ontario market opening. As you know, the market was 
scheduled to open November 1,2000. We had anticipated somewhat of a delay and 
had forecasted a Feb 1, 2001 start. This week the Minister of Energy 
announced that market opening would be delayed ""about 6 months"". This of 
course is very dissppointing to us and Aleck Dadson is working hard with the 
Ministry and other interested parties in shoring up a date with a tighter 
time frame.

The reason for the delay is primarily due to the lack of readiness on behalf 
of the IMO. This is a frustrating situation for the minister and as such he 
has moved to appoint myself to the IMO Board. It should be noted that the 
Minister did not accept the IMO's board recommendation but unilaterally went 
with me. He was intent on appointing someone who had goal alignment re 
opening this market asap. This goes a long way in illustrating the great job 
our regulatory group (Aleck Dadson) has done/is doing  in 
positioning/developing credibility with the Ministry of Energy.   

I know that you had concerns re time commitment but I believe strongly that 
Enron needs a voice at the IMO Board as this is a critical point in time to 
shape this marketplace.

Regards
Milnthorp

"EPC for Eletrobolt","Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price 
contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from 
such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.  
My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like 
#1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests 
appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already 
given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end 
of the scale and early.

Drop me a note on where you end up.

Dave:

Do you have any general guidance on how you would like for me to approach the 
EPC contract with NEPCO Houston?  The three options that we currently have on 
the table are:

Fixed engineering/internal costs with pass-through on external costs with fee.
Same structure with cap.
Fixed price contract.

Our last conversation was very focused on a fixed price contract.  My 
conversations with Dan Leff were moving in the direction of one or two.  My 
concern on a fixed price number is the timing and my negotiating position, 
but I understand your issues.  Any general thoughts would be helpful.

Thanks,
Brett

Subject: Brigham

We have completed the sale of our Brigham investment for $20.0 million 
(JEDI/ENA).  ENA's net share of the proceeds for $12.5 million.   The 
transaction has been closed and funded and at the book/raptor value.

My metaphor for pulling together liquidation transactions of severely 
distressed assets like Brigham is trying to shield a pencil balanced on its 
point in the midst of a hurricane.  In the case of the Brigham deal the 
hurricane was a Force Five.

Jempy Neyman, who led the transaction, and Brandi Morris, a senior specialist 
in Special Assets, did an outstanding job getting this tough deal done.

The next ""balanced pencil"" is closing the Basic Energy (Sierra Well Service) 
sale by mid-November.  We're on track:  so far, the hurricane has not  blown 
the pencil away.

"Update GIS Information","With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.

"Re: TVA Issued RFP for peaking power","Attorney-Client Protected

Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and 
values and they don't accept it - does that not support a case where damages 
from the MOPA , for that 500 MW, can be defined to be equal to or lower than 
our submission.

Attorney-Client Protected

No, I don't think so.  TVA wants a two year PPA with 100% control, including 
AGC and hourly dispatch.  We would have to price the capacity and energy 
product they are asking for extremely high, and we run the risk of increasing 
our LD exposure in the pending litigation.

If Elizabeth thinks we can use the RFP to help our legal case, I would 
certainly support a response that helps our overall ecomomic position.

February, a total of $2.251 MM was accrued in March of this year.

Subject: Re: Spring Business Meeting  

Dave --

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I 
wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed 
via a few initiatives, including:

1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the 
direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year)
2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up
3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend
4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have 
been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting)

There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but 
this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy 
to sit down and discuss this with you.

Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a 
meeting, we need to pick a date and get on the Hyatt calendar soon.  Their 
calendar is filling up quickly.  Thanks.

However, they did suggest that you might like to consider a Permanent

Subject: Project 20/20 Status

Julie and Jean,
Pursuant to our telephone conversation this morning, this e-mail is intended 
to update the status of project 20/20.
There are 6 major items that need to be completed prior to closing this 
transaction.  The items and the expected completion dates are outlined below:

Closing Item   Expected Completion Date Status
1. Execution of LOU  August 4   Several issues remain to be negotiated.
        I do not anticipate any problem in reaching mutual agreement on the 
issues.
        Border meets with their audit committee on August 2 and hopes to sign 
August 3.
        Will be in the position to review with you and Dave on August 1 or 2.

2. Employment Issues  August 14   Offers of employment/transfer are in the 
process of being designed and prepared. Primary         issues include a) 
identification and handling of ENA end-of-year bonus compensation 
(Shiela         Knudson is coordinating this and I feel this issue is being 
adequately addressed).
        b) potential disparity between GPG and ENA incentive compensation 
plans. I am working with Bill         Cordes and Ann Vaughn w/ GPG on 
developing a plan that will address this issue.  Based on the         
conference call with Bill and Ann this morning, I am optimistic that this 
issue will be properly         addressed.  The plan is to have employment 
issues identified in a letter and presented to          employees on August 
7th.

3. Reserve Consultants  August 11   Kicked off consultants in a meeting in 
Omaha on July 26th. We are providing information and         assisting in the 
process.

4. Due Diligence  August 25   A detailed schedule of all due diligence 
activity is being updated by Northern Border and I will         forward that 
schedule to you once I receive the update.

5. Hart, Scott Rodino  September 8-15   There is a high probability that a 
Hart, Scott, Rodino filing will have to be made upon execution of         the 
LOU. There is a 30 day review period.  This may be the critical path item.

6. Drafting/Negotiating PSA September 8-15   Shonnie Daniel is coordinating 
the drafting of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. It is expected         that 
this agreement will be agreed upon in early to mid September.

One key date you should be aware of is Northern Border is anticipating making 
a press release after the LOU is executed (release date is expected to be 
August 7).  They will be coordinating press release issues with Eric Thode.

I feel confident that this transaction will be closed in September. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a ""Bundle Products"" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give 
you a call to discuss further.

Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:

 - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron 
and EES;
 - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 
2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001;
 - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs 
to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for 
the large industrial customer);
 - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going 
forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that 
effort;
 - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals;
 - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - 
no bullshit politics;
 - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership;
 - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success;
 - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February 
early March.

PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.

Talk to you soon!!

Dave,

It would be really great for you to do that.  Unfortunately we start at 
10.30am UK / 4.30am US time (the only slot we could get for the Auditorium).  
It won't be as cool as a video link up, but if you give me a text message 
addressed to all European staff, I'll read it out.

I'll get the senior guys together on Monday for the weekly EES 2.30pm UK / 
8.30am US video conference call so you and Janet can at least speak to them.

Let's get you and Janet over to Europe to meet and greet the troops in person

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Subject: Beau Canada

Dave, I had a call from Bradford today and he has Buy's sign-off on 
recognizing U.S. $1.1MM credit exposure reduction as a result of our efforts 
on securing a 3rd charge on Beau's assets (additionally, the 3rd charge 
follows the assets with the Murphy credit upgrade). It is important to 
continue to send originators the right signals re credit mitigation and 
therefore I feel it is imperative that we grant the $1.1MM as origination to 
reward those efforts.

Please advise that you are in agreement, and we will book asap. 

Regards

Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both 
himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which 
should help leverage your product into this sector. Scott and John have 
agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets 
with no delay.  From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team 
will go speak to them about the opportunities.  I would expect that we will 
be in front of these folks ASAP.  Lets see how the product is embraced by 
these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal 
alignment of the groups.  As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are 
working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.

"EPMI WEST - Recent Trades with Long term Duration","Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Dave/John:

As you know, EPMI West recently has closed numerous longer-dated transactions 
(through 2002 and beyond) with munis and other direct counterparties (not 
marketers).  Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the 
Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, 
each with a different role, working out the split of origination to 
everyone's satisfaction. Tim Belden (see below) thought you might be 
interested in the attached spreadsheet listing some of these key deals done 
this year.  

Please let me know if you want further details on the transactions 
(503/464-3822).

Thanks!

Could you please send an e-mail to Delainey, Lavorato, and Calger summarizing 
our long term deals done this year.  It should be pretty short with just the 
facts.  The deals I can think of are Kaiser, Roseville, Santa Clara, Redding, 
and Merced.  They didn't ask for it, but I think it would be nice to do a 
quick, short, sweet piece of Portland Orig/Middle Market PR.  Let me know 
your thoughts.

Subject: Re: Calpine  

Dave,

Thanks for following through with the contact.  As we discussed, the 
discussions we had with Calpine were at a local level and very preliminary, 
with Bridgeline indicating to Calpine that we are always open to looking at 
ways that will enhance shareholder value.  I agree with you that at this time 
it has a low probability of evolving into anything.  

On a separate note, I would like to take you up on your offer of your time 
and resources.  I know that Bridgeline is a very small component of the 
things that are on your radar screen, but if it is not too much of an 
imposition, I would like to have a one on one discussion with you concerning 
a few of the issues we discussed at the management committee mtg.

I want to make sure that I am crystal clear on the perspectives and desires 
of both parents.  Coming from Texaco, I feel like I have a good feel for 
Texaco's short and long term expectations for the partnership, however I 
would like to dig a little deeper with you on a few of the issues we 
discussed at the management committee mtg, and a couple of your points in 
your follow up email to me.

The afternoon or evening would work best for me, and I would be happy to pick 
up the tab for dinner one night if that fits with your schedule.  The balance 
of this week is kind of tight, however, the week of September 2nd and 9th are 
fairly open with the exception of Tuesday night the 3rd.

Thanks for your help, look forward to talking to you soon. 


Randy

Subject: Calpine

Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential 
interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real 
knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level 
and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more 
detail over the next week.

Subject: ESA's LM 6000's

Guys, although I am hesitant to get in between ESA and ENA on this issue, my 
perception is that there is some confusion; we need to sort out at the top.  
Let me describe what I understand of the facts.  

First, ESA is coordinating a DASH through the RAC for eight LM 6000's.

Second, ENA has a list of 24 LM 6000's; the ""ready to ship date"" as shown on 
the following attachment; but only four of these are earmarked for ESA, as 
far as I understand.

Third, GE/S&S has approached me and is willing to sell us more LM 6000's if 
we need to.  The ""ready to ship dates"" for these new LM 6000's are between 
January - March, 2001.  We could possibly get these at the current preferred 
pricing (as a current contract change order).

ESA and ENA should discuss whether or not either party wants to buy some of 
the new LM 6000's that are now available for delivery between January - 
March, 2001.  Does ENA want to substitute any of these for LM 6000's 
currently on hand and not allocated to ESA?  Is ENA earmarking four 
additional LM 6000's on the attached list to ESA, and if so, which ones?  If 
not, does ESA want EECC to secure any or all of the remaining units required, 
which we can do quickly, off the balance sheet.

My perception is that there is confusion and not clear direction, I recommend 
that both of you have a discussion and establish a clear definition of what 
we are doing with the LM 6000's and whether either of you want to entertain 
the purchase of the new LM 6000's.  Let me know if I can help.

Unit 1:  the repair plan is complete, but has not been written.  We will 
trade our rotor (upgraded to E specs) for Occidental's rotor.  Occidental's 
rotor is on the way to GE's Houston shop in order to grind its blades to fit 
our unit.  A new stub shaft is needed and has been acquired.  We will acquire 
Reliant's stationary blades in exchange for new replacement blades.  Total

the producer services market segment.  They can provide mid-market coverage, 
producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc.  As per our previous

products to the segment.  Please keep this confidential - but please speak 
with Jean Mrha.

The names include:
 Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region;
 Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale);

 Jill Zivley - director -  lead the east region;
 Gary Bryan - director - east region;
 Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region;
 Bill Brogan - manager - east region;
 Kreg Hall - analyst - east region;
 Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).

Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the

until post sale.  Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given 
their experience and availability.

Subject: Gleason

Bob Virgo has informed me that the desk wants to convert Gleason to combined 
cycle.  Bob told me this in the context of asking me whether Calpine would 
sell us any additional combined cycle equipment (i.e., steam turbines).  My 
guess is they won't.

If 1) it was of interest to us and 2) we are really going to convert Gleason, 
I think I could get Calpine to execute a purchase/short term tolling 
transaction on Gleason on favorable terms.  I say this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Calpine is typically a strong bid for combined cycle installations.
2.  Calpine has been trying unsuccessfully to get a combined cycle project in 
TVA (due to their rank in the cue) and thinks that it will take them a year 
to get through TVA.  We actually think that their project is blocked. 
3.  Calpine would likely take the incremental construction cost risk on the 
transaction.
4.  I believe that Calpine would undertake the permitting and interconnection 
work at their cost  and risk, if needed.  Given the cost of preparing a 
combined cycle permit along with the potential fight that ENA might face from 
TVA in such an effort, this risk sharing scenario could be attractive to ENA.
5.  Calpine would likely accept a short term tolling arrangement.  On their 
eastern assets, Calpine is generally executing 1-2 year deals.
6.  Calpine particularly in the east has been aggressively purchasing 
projects.
7.  If feasible, Calpine would probably be willing to further increase the 
size of Gleason.  Calpine's current plants announcements are generally in the 
700-1,000 MW range.

I know that Dave Delainey has not previously supported selling Gleason 
individually.  However, you may want to investigate if anything has changed 
in this circumstance, particularly since we are not generally a strong bid 
for combined cycle projects.  Please let me know. 

FYI--Dave Duran and I are meeting with Bob Kelly of Calpine on next Tuesday 
to discuss the use of Enron NOLs in Calpine's PG&E contract buyouts.

Subject: Trading Tapes

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I 
propose the following:

1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 
months

2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only 
the deal terms at the end of a call

The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.

Subject: Re: Cogentrix Turbine Inquiry  

As a matter of fact, this is on my list to discuss with you. I think we 
should pick up the 7EA's and maybe the 501D's as well (doubt we could pick 
and choose). I met with Mark Frevert yesterday afternoon to discuss the East 
Generation Strategy (along with Ben Jacoby and Don Miller) and he wanted me 
to talk with Larry Izzo about us taking all 4 turbines. Should I go ahead and 
have that discussion or would you like to discuss this in more detail first? 
The LM6000 position looks like this:

24 turbines allocated:

4 City of Austin
4 Enron South America
4 Las Vegas Cogen
6 Public Service of Colorado
6 Florida Merchant plant


Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan are bringing their VEPCO/North Carolina deal to 
a point where we will probably need to make a decision in the next 2-3 weeks. 
It has a 4-year PPA and we are basically obligated to build a power plant to 
back-fill the position. The PPA will be able to be served from the market or 
plant, and we would need to use 4 of the 6 dual-fuel LM's currently allocated 
to Florida. There is a possibility we could go back to the 501D's but we'll 
have to see. The ecomomics of the deal leave Enron with about a 40-45% 
residual value on the plant at the end of 4 years, and Bruce Sukaly is in the 
process of showing this entire project to 4 counterparties in order to 
monetize the entire position.

We still have 2-3 other customers looking at the LM's although they are 
moving fairly slow.

I'd like to discuss our development strategy in a little more detail with you 
when you return but here are the highlights: Ben and his team will be looking 
to increase the sites we have under our control in several regions: PJM, 
ECAR, Georgia, and Florida to name a few. I think we may want to consider 
some configurations that include combined-cycle options that have a 5-year 
term (vs. our standard 2-year currently), primarily in Florida and maybe 
Georgia. Ben is putting this on paper along with the incremental resource 
needs and incremental developmental dollars needed. I think we should talk 
about increasing our site bank/development portfolio in Canada as well.  

Let me know your thoughts! Thanks.

"Re: Organizational Changes","Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board 
meetings and PRC's.

Lets set up this discussion with the following points:
 a) we are not exiting Argentina;
 b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business 
opportunity;
 c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate 
intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater 
productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision 
making and greater communication;
 d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer 
coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and
 e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao 
Paulo.

Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and 
origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources 
based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs 
wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong 
presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural 
issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that 
you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina 
- its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business 
model we are trying to move forward.

Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these 
ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and 
Orlando as part of this process.

FYI, 
On Tuesday, I pulled the trigger on the VPP for Crescendo.  The total was 
just in excess of $8,000,000.  I have executed ISDA for the financial swaps 
and am awaiting final doc's for the Enfolio Master Agreement for execution.  
I have passed this on to Lavorato.  The transaction proceeded fairly 
smoothly.  I have met with John Arnold on the best means of working with his 
group.  He suggested that we continue to work through Fred.  Fred, John 
Prevatt, and Arnold were very helpful in enabling me to pull the trigger at 
the peak of the curve on Tuesday.  I am no longer ""spec - ing"" gas.  It was

I will keep you posted.

Subject: Re: Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals  

Dave,

As of today, the Transaction Approval Process requires that any embedded 
financing over $500,000 needs to be DASHed.  RAC, however, is close to 
finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and 
tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval 
document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and 
maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.  For 
example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with 
standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated 
approval document.  This abbreviated approval document would only be 
available for transactions meeting these criteria if:  (i) structured 
financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is 
manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met 
a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate 
credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.

The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of 
relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is 
impractical or inefficient.  It is presently contemplated that the 
abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:  the 
Originator's and  a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with 
business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions 
approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.  In 
any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you 
for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the 
preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

Subject: Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals

Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.

Grant County    7/01 to 7/06   7/06   $4.7 million
Grant County    5/01 to 7/06   7/06   $5.7 million

Eugene Water and Electric  7/2001 to 12/2002 5/2002 to 12/2002  $7.3 million

We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is

direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a 
pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon 
starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The 
Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The 
meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities,

key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where 
necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the 
program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet 
commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.

The goals of any restructuring are:
 a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the 
business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the 
program;
 b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;
 c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling 
and interviewing;
 d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly 
grounds the associate in the ""Enron technology"" which include skills in 
market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;
 e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding 
talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them 
up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the 
program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;
 f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, 
retention and performance tool;
 g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, 
non-traditional sources of talent and
 h) increase cost effectiveness.

The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, 
people and teams, business tracks, etc.

I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the 
key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the 
least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.

I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with 
a strawman.

Let me know your thoughts.

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the ""yeses"", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the ""no's"", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Sorry that my arrangements with Jana G. in the Associates Program to change 
the date of the Associates PRC were over-ruled by Charlene.  I had agreed 
with Jana that swapping the dates of the Analysts and Associates PRC meetings 
was a great solution.  Despite the fact that the program had not checked with 
us as PRC reps to see if December 13 was a convenient date, Charlene 
developed an interesting concern over potentially inconveniencing the 
directors who are PRC reps for the Analyst PRC.  And I see that you were 
drafted into facilitating the whole meeting!  

I am scheduled on the 5:35 flight from IAH to Las Vegas on the afternoon of 
the 13th.  I would have to leave downtown by 4:15 to make that flight.  I 
have been asked to confirm those flight arrangements so that a ticket can be 
issued.  Since you will be in charge, will this flight time work?  --Sally

Dave,

I spoke with Frank Gardner, the acting President of the mine.  The mine has 
shut down due to high power prices and they are evaluating reopening it later 
this year.  John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very 
well (Frank acknowledged that).  EPMI has served this load in the past and 
made numerous proposals to them during the past year.  Montana rejected 
these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below 
the current forward market price.  John has also proposed various 
cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.  John will discuss 
their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.  I do not 
think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long 
and the industrials' credit is marginal.  We will keep you posted if anything 
materializes. 

Regards,

Chris

Subject: California bankruptcy expenses

I would like some guidance about  outside counsel fees related to the 
California situation.  We ( EES and ENA) retained joint counsel in early 
January. As you may recall, in January a substantial amount of work was done 
with the attempted rescue effort by the US Department of Treasury, and the  
managing down of the trading positions with PG&E's unregulated entity.  

I would say that  EES and ENA have used this counsel relatively equally, and 
it would not be inappropriate to split the bills on a  50/50 basis.  However, 
there are two other issues that we should consider: (a) on an overall basis, 
I would say that ENA will have more  issues  that will come out of the 
bankruptcy, and (b) certainly, they will be easier able to absorb as  a 
company  the increased legal expenses.  

Please let me know whether we should go forward with the 50/50 arrangement or 
whether we should adopt another approach.

One other fact:  We also have joint representation in the class action 
lawsuits filed against the power marketers.  To date, no sharing  has been 
agreed to, based on EES' position that in is improperly named in the lawsuit 
(i.e., it is not a participant in the wholesale markets and did not  benefit 
from the  volatility this summer).

Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Dave,

CSFB spoke with DPL today.  Pete Forster (chairman) said he wants to meet 
with you to discuss peakers and other opportunities on the trading and 
marketing side.  Besides 3200 MWs of Ohio regulated assets, DPL has a peaking 
strategy in ECAR and today has 400-500 MWs in development (interesting to 
have peaking strategy with no T&M).  They would like to look at our peakers 
to supplement strategy.  Forster didn't flinch when they said $400 kW is the 
ballpark number.  More interestingly, Forster went into his desire to talk 
with you about other ideas relating to T&M.  

Forster suggested 27th or 28th of July for the meeting.  You are more open on 
the 28th.  It appears Forster may be open to coming down here.  He wants CSFB 
and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule.  CSFB is DPL's main advisor, and the 
guys that negotiated the KKR deal a while back.

Apparently we are talking with these guys on the gas side.

Regards,

Don

"Various","Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Delainey

"Cogentrix Turbine Inquiry","Janet, we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very 
pleasant.  I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with 
an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.  I'm also starting to think 
as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris 
should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.  Something to think about, I 
am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without 
some resource availability.  I think you have to feel pretty good about the 
LM position first.  Something to think about?

Hey Dave, what's the real deal on the 7FA ""swap"" with Larry Izzo? Do they 
have the capability to give us another 7FA in 2001-2002? I listened to two 
voicemails from Cogentrix this am and they do seem to be serious about 
purchasing an incremental 1-2 7FA's if they can be delivered by winter 2002. 
I think their preference is to buy the turbine from us on the front end with 
no partnering in the project. There has been no serious negotiation on this 
to date and I don't want Scott to waste his time if we really don't have the 
turbine from EE&CC. Please advise. Thanks.

Subject: Cogentrix Turbine Inquiry

Per our telephone conversation today, I have been asked by two Cogentrix 
executives if we have any General Electric 7FA turbines (for delivery in 
2002) available for sale. I believe that Cogentrix needs the turbine for one 
of the combined cycle projects it has been permitting in Entergy or TVA. They 
seen somewhat anxious.

As we discussed, I will let Cogentrix know about the availability of the two 
General Electric 7EA's and the two Westinghouse 501-D's. What about the 7FA 
that Dave Delainey loaned to EE&CC, could this turbine be available for sale 
to Cogentrix?

Scott

"Mid-year 2000 Performance Review Process","As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention 
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a 
number of important tasks and projects in process.  While recognizing this, 
it remains extremely important to take time over the next few weeks to gather 
necessary information to provide quality and meaningful feedback for our 
employees, as well as utilize this information during the year end review 
process.

In the spirit of One Enron, the Performance Review Process (PRC) will be 
global for Mid-year 2000.  Vice Presidents and above across all operating 
companies will be reviewed and discussed in a consistent manner with 
identical criteria.   ENA will review all professional level and above 
employees.  The timeline and training for the midyear process are outlined at 
the end of this memo.  Your HR Business Consultant is also available to 
answer questions.

With regards to the Global Functions, review sessions will be led by the 
Global and/or Corporate Functional heads, and will be designed to calibrate 
personnel within these areas of expertise.  The Global Functional Review 
Areas include:

_ NetWorks/Technology
_ Accounting
_ RAC
_ Finance
_ Human Resources
_ Public Relations & Reg Affairs	G. Whalley
	R. Causey
	R.  Buy
	A. Fastow
	C. Olson
	S. Kean
       
ENA Mid-Year Process:

ENA has received favorable feedback on the review process used for Mid-year 
and Year-end 1999, and as such, will follow the same general guidelines and 
process for Mid-year 2000.  The following are key features of the Mid-year 
2000 process:

o The focus of the feedback will continue to be on the qualitative aspects, 
as opposed to quantitative.  Toward this end, communication of the employee,s 
explicit ranking will be left to the discretion of the business unit manager.
o Initial discussions with employees regarding their accomplishments, are 
highly encouraged, prior to the Business Review Meetings.
o Mid-year performance results will be used as baseline performance 
information for Year-end 2000.
o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups.  
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale.  
o All exempt employees will be discussed at Business Review Meetings and 
placed into one of six categories by peer group.  ENA VP's will be pre-ranked 
by the ENA Office of the Chairman and Managing Directors prior to the Enron 
PRC.  Non-exempt (overtime eligible) employees will be evaluated by their 
supervisors and placed into one of the 6 categories.  The results of the 
Business Review Meetings will be the final rankings for exempt employees 
below VP, subject to ENA Office of the Chairman.
o A minimum of two representatives from other functional areas will be 
required at the Business Review Meetings.  The meetings should otherwise be 
rescheduled to allow this very important representation to take place.  The 
nominated individuals are illustrated below.
o The top 5 HR priorities/challenges for 2000 should also be agreed to at the 
Business Review Meetings.
o Analysts and Associates will be pre-reviewed in a Business Review Meetings 
based on their current rotation, then cross-calibrated at the Enron Global 
Analyst and Associate Business Review Meeting.

Peer Groups:

 Commercial
 Commercial Support
 Technical
 Specialized Technical

Performance Criteria (for all peer groups):

Innovation/Entrepreneurship
Communication/Setting Direction
Teamwork/Interpersonal
Leadership/Vision/Values 
Business Instinct
Analytical/Technical

Guidelines:

o Use of multiple sources of input is encouraged (employee, peers, direct 
reports, internal customers, external customers), as is a self-evaluation
o Employees should recommend 5-10 reviewers to Supervisor and Supervisor 
should select at least three of the employee,s recommendations
o All feedback must be entered via the Performance Management System located 
on the intranet
o Supervisor should consolidate the feedback, prepare a draft of the 
Performance Review form and meet with the employee prior to the Business 
Review meeting
o Final feedback to exempt employee follows the July 28th meeting
o For VP's & MD's, final feedback follows the Enron Executive Committee 
Meeting

Business Review Meetings / VP Pre-Ranking Committee Meeting 
Responsibilities / Actions:

The following list represents suggested groups and the individuals 
responsible for each Business Review Meeting.  Attendees at the meetings are 
appropriate Supervisors within the Business Unit.  In addition, the Office of

Thanks Dave.   This 12 MW output increase is at 90 degrees and we could 
easily demonstrate this increased output with a capacity test for any 
potential buyer.  Therefore, the increased sales value is real.

Mitch, Mike and myself will sort this out to maximize value for Enron (and

Dave,

I am sorry to bother you with this, but I need the benefit of your global 
information base.  Please take a look at the attached email that I sent 
yesterday (the critical issue is in bold faced type).  It is really important 
that we provide a prompt response so that Cinergy can complete their FERC

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

I believe the correct answer is only New Albany since we do not control the 
MW's for Doyle.  New Albany is a nominal 380MW facility.

Sam Behrends of LLGM needs to have an answer to the following question no 
later than the end of business today.  Please provide any information that 
you might have.

""Following the sale of the 2000 peakers to Allegheny and the two 99 peakers 
to Cinergy, how much generation will Enron still own within two wheels of 
TVA?""

I think that the answer is New Albany and Doyle (except that we only own 50% 
of Doyle and Doyle does not have any merchant capacity to sell (i.e. the 
facility is fully dedicated to Oglethorpe)).  I am not certain, however, that 
I have thought of everything and don't know the capacities for these two 
facilities.

Thanks in advance for your help.

          12/07/2000 11:53 PM
	

Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON

Subject: Organizational Changes

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, 
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide 
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that 
are underway to restructure  Enron,s operations in South America.  The basic 
organizational framework has been set. 

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and 
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting 
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility; 
however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination, 
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe,s focus will 
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall 
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO 
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding 
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in 
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark 
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and 
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our 
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being 
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets 
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South 
America will be organized around the highly successful North American network 
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical 
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value 
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and 
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to 
Joe and Orlando:
 
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will  
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine 
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services 
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital 
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the 
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value 
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move 
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the 
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America 
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal 
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who 
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, 
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, 
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. 

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The 
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book 
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales 
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively 
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible 
for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct 
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas 
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American 
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we 
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.  

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization 
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support 
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team 
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in 
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business 
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as 
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston 
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements 
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will 
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as 
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, 
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a 
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will 
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this 
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory 
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick 
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the 
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his 
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will 
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be 
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the 
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and 
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal 
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron 
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information 
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will 
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial 
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting 
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron 
Wholesale Services ) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale 
Services ) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and 
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our 
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new 
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the 
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly 
affected will be notified shortly.
 
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its 
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are 
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create 
shareholder value.

Subject: Genco Services Agreement

Dave,

We had a good meeting with Presto today.  We came away with a broad T&M 
outline.  One concern that Kevin raised is our ability to actually do a 
""services agreement"" for the risk management and back offices aspect of 
NewCo.  Apparently, he said a number of issues have bubbled up recently with 
our systems in terms of manpower, age of system, and ability to take on 
additional load.  He said throwing on an incremental 4000-5000 MWs with NewCo 
may prove to be too much to handle.  He also raised the ""confidentiality 
issue"".  It is his view that NewCo should have this capability in-house 
anyway (obviously that was always the long term intent, with this services 
agreement more a bridge).

Several options exist.
1.  Force a 12-24 month services agreement through the system (solve our 
problems with more people, etc).

2.  Agree to set up NewCo's system using our unique expertise and experience. 
We would do this for a fee (say $15MM?).   One issue here is just NewCo's 
ability to get this done in conjunction with everything else in time to do 
IPO.

3. Investigate what type of system FPLe is using today.  Since we are not 
increasing net merchant MWs on day 1, FPLe's system could serve as the 
platform for future MW expansion.  Maybe Enron comes in and expands/redesigns 
system for a fee?  I believe that FPLe has just recently expanded/updated 
their system.  I would like to try to learn more about their system.

Let me know if you have a preference or any additional thoughts.  I think we 
can make money off of all three options.

Thanks,

Don

Jake is Orion, so Jake let Don Miller know this.  We will have a handle on 
preliminary feedback from these parties on Friday.  

Pastoria and LVCogen:  Deal books should have arrived.  Do you want to meet 
on these?  who would you like to meet with?  Parquet for Pastoria and 
Gilbert/Clark for LVCogen?  

Pastoria DASH is being finalized along with the Catalytica DASH.  Pastoria 
costs will be higher given the unwind of the Xonon swap and the fact that 
turbine costs were padded by $9MM for GE's catalytica development costs 
(argument for a value-grab!)

FYI I called Patrick Stevens of Triumph Energy three times...the number I 
called appeared to be an office shared with other companies.  The general 
number's voicemail was full so I have not reached him.

Scott Healy changed his decision and is going to work for Duran.  I dont 
understand his decision but Scott said that the ""organization"" thought it 
would be a better opportunity in Houston.

Could you shed some light on this for me?  What are you looking for?  I'm 
afraid I might lose something as it gets translated from you to Wes to Paula 
to me back to Paula to Wes to you.  Perhaps we can discuss while you are here.

Tim,

Dave Delainey is looking for a target customer list, coverage metrics and 
goal and objectives for each of your teams:

 West Power Trading
 West Power Mid-Market/Services
 West Power Fundamentals/Structuring

Obviously his proposed breakout of your teams (noted above) is different from 
the way we planned them.  For expense purposes, do you want me to add Volume 
Management, Real-Time, Pre-Scheduling and Admins to West Power Trading?  

Unfortunately, we have a tight deadline because Delainey is looking for this 
information by the end of the week.  Do you think you can provide this 
information to me by Thursday?  Also, if you could let me know today about 
the expense breakout, I can start working on that now.

Thanks, Paula.

Subject: Re: Are we finding value in outsourcing? - GE Plastics  

I believe you would be the grief master on this subject at least in terms of 
""you better start delivering on this stuff"".  By the way the pitch to 
Colonial pipeline went okay yesterday.  Good news - Bill Scott CEO said we 
were the only company that could deliver exactly what he asked for.  Bad news 
is that he thought it should be 25% lower.  I believe his reaction is simply 
a gut reaction from a former trader and we are following up with information 
to get him better educated as to why this is a good deal for him.  We have 
$20 - $30mm in the deal and this creates roughly $70mm of value or savings 
(depending on your assumptions) for Colonial.  I believe we can get to a 
trade with them.  I'll keep you updated.

Thanks,
Rodney

Subject: Are we finding value in outsourcing? - GE Plastics

This week we will begin discussions on structure and pricing with GE 
Plastics.  At the risk of getting committed to earnings delivery I thought it 
would be helpful to give a range of value to us & GE at least before the 
economics start to deteriorate in negotiations.  Currently the proposal would 
require GE to step up to ten year fixed price positions that would create the 
following split up of economics:

Savings to GE $33MM PV
Value to Enron $15MM with $10MM of this value in bookable mark to market
$40 MM in capital invested in the Demand Side Management Projects.

I think that this suggests there should be value in our outsourcing efforts.

Thanks,
Rodney

"Indian Mesa","Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Delainey

Subject: FPL Update

We spent three days meeting with the FPL guys last week.  The meetings were 
productive, and we are making progress.  Lew has instructed these guys to get 
down into a lot of detail on the business plan/core competencies, which we 
did!

They also floated the valuation of their existing assets - $3.1B for 3947 MWs 
or $789/kW.  We walked them through our peaker valuation as well.  We didn't 
debate the valuations, but rather we decided to go ahead and have Clement and 
Jinsung try to pull together a consolidated model for NewCo.  That is being 
done, and should be ready Monday/Tuesday. 

It is apparent from these meetings that they are looking for ENRON to provide 
several key pieces to NewCo (other than peakers and dev. projects):

1. Enron culture and emphasis on intellectual capital (including HR approach).
2. Trading and marketing expertise.
3. Enron style finance.
4. Select management spots.
5. Supplement development team.

The interesting debate is how we get compensated for the significant impact 
that the Enron ""halo"" is going to have on NewCo's IPO ( particularly if we 
deliver the items listed above).  I raised this incremental value issue with 
them.

FPL's key pieces include:

1. Core ""operating"" competencies and asset management techniques.
2. Construction management techniques.
3.  Select management spots.
4.  National development team.

The FPL risk in this whole exercise is if Lew is unsuccessful in convincing 
Broadhead that owning some % of NewCo is not a better value proposition that 
owning 100% on FPLE; and/or the decision to wait until Florida deregulates 
before spinning out FPLE.  Glenn Smith stopped by last week and he 
highlighted these issues as well.

We have a lot of work to do this week including a need to determine Trading & 
Marketing model; develop potential services agreements (QF, back office); 
refine our financial model and expand to include new projects, turbine capx, 
etc.; expand development framework;  pull pitch together to float NewCo by 
investment bank, etc.....

I am happy to expand on exactly where we stand with FPL.  I guess we also 
need to think about staffing if both Cinergy and FPL move forward (let's just 
sell the peakers to Cinergy for $1.25B and let them do their own IPO).

Regards,

Don

gas distribution members of the  AGA  at their monthly meeting on  September  
19th.    If you don't know her, Margaret works under me and provides research 
for Govt Affairs and business units throughout Enron.
 
The  topic of the presentation is --  
What  current  prices for natural gas mean for gas distributors and their 
strategies for asset management?  
Who, if anyone, would you like us to pass this along to?   Give me a call if

Subject: Land Purchase

Dave:

Some time ago, I had received approval to purchase the primary block of land 
for the Rio project site from Jim.  One year ago, we had acquired the rights 
to purchase the land under an option agreement.  This agreement is about to 
expire and we are currently closing the transaction to purchase the land.  
The total purchase price of the block is $1.7 million.  This closing is to 
take place tomorrow.  Given the changes, I thought I should run this by you 
to make sure you would be in agreement.  I had hoped that this would be a 
moot point with the Petrobras agreement closed.  However, I think we may be a 
couple more days on that.  I am very concerned with waiting on the landowner 
given that our option agreement will be expiring.  Please let me know if it 
is ok to move forward with the land purchase.

Thanks,
Brett

Congratulations ( I think?) on your new assignment.

If you get a chance in the next few days, drive by this building I have.  It 
is at 5205 Spruce (2 blocks north of Bellaire Blvd and 2 blocks west of Rice) 
in Bellaire.  It  is a great building for what you need for your cars.  It 
will lease for about $12-$15/sf annually (about 5000 sf including the garage 
space) and I have about $750,000 in the building.  If you have 1/3 of the 
building (+-$250,000) it will cost you about $1,600/mo in interest.  This is 
about what it would cost to put your 3 cars in a climate controlled storage 
space (probably less) at a USTOREIT.  Let me know if you're interested in 
looking at a deal structure.

Subject: ENA, EGM and EIM representation for this seasons Campus recuiting 
efforts

Attached is a spreadsheet summarising the current volunteers from our 
operating companies for this coming season of campus recruiting efforts for 
Analysts and Associates. This information comes from the program and I am 
told is accurate as of last week.



In speaking with many of you over the last few months, I believe it is fair 
to say we have agreed that it is critical for the senior management team to 
show their support for the program and be intimately involved in the 
recruiting process for new Analysts and Associates. In particular, many of 
you have remarked that we are generally short of these resources, as well as 
being short of specific skills which we need either in trading, finance, 
origination or assets to grow our businesses.

In this regard, having reviewed the attached I would suggest that those of 
you that have not currently volunteered to join one of the school recruiting 
teams as well as many of our VP's who have not done so, are encouraged to 
step up immediately. In the spirit of cutting to the chase, here is my 
suggested additional participation, which with your support I will forward to 
Charlene's team and ask them to contact and make themselves available for the 
scheduled school presentation:

Under Grad
 Florida  Colwell
Vanderbilt Ader, Beyer
Penn  Beirbach, Pagan 
Michigan Burnett, Bradley
Baylor  Cocavessis
Morehouse Gomez
Uof H  Detmering
MIT  Hermans
Berkeley McDonald
NYU  Kinneman
Minnesota Ducote
Carnegie Miller


Grad Schools
UCLA  Swerzbin
Rice  Muhl, Duran
Darden  Pruett 
Columbia Reck, Sharp
Georgetown Shedd
Harvard Luce, Josey
Michigan Frevert, Parquet
MIT  Tricoli, Milnthorp
Wharton Kitagawa, Malcolm 
Vanderbilt McClellan, Oxley


Let me know if you think any of these are inappropriate. I will update this 
based on any feedback and contact the individuals directly early next week to 
let them know we would appreciate their help in these efforts.

David

Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information 
supplied by Steve, it is doubtful that the assets and on-going organization 
would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing 
to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, 
although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay 
this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion 
among the Houston teams only, I am assuming the PDP reserves are solid, no 
major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are 
standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough 
time on this effort. 

On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My 
understanding is that Jedi I owns 100% of C-GAS and the Jedi I fund WILL be 
liquidated before the end of the year.  At what price will your unit pay to 
liquidate the fund?

Subject: 2001 Plan

Dave,

You asked about office costs, depreciation and headcount:

Office Costs are correct and include rent, supplies, backoffice expenses, 
general marketing and charitable contributions.

Depreciation includes leashold improvements (walls, carpet and paint) and 
certain computers/IT not covered in the IT allocation (Tim is checking on the 
$278K)

Headcount is close: my actual 2000 headcount is 38, not 36 and Tim's plan for 
2001 may be overstated by one or two; overall headcount increase is probably 
15, not 18.

Hope this clarifies the plan.

Regards,

Chris

Subject: PRC Rep and Pre-rating meeting

Dave,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director to represent Analysts at the final 
2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and additions to the Associate and Analyst 
Programs, we have an additional slot for the Analyst PRC that we would like 
to fill with an ENA participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout 
the business units equitable.  I understand from Charlene that you have asked 
Janet Dietrich to nominate the PRC Rep.

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for ENA representation to me by this date or contact me to discuss.

Also, I know that there have been discussions between Terry Bosien, David 
Oxley, Andrea Yowman and others to schedule ENA's pre-rating meeting prior to 
the final A/A PRC which has been scheduled for December 12th and 13th.  We 
must have the pre-ratings loaded into the PEP system prior to these dates and 
hope they can be final by November 30th.  These results are imperative to a 
successful cross-calibration in the final PRC meeting.  We already have dates 
set for the EES and ESA meetings.  I will be glad to attend the Associate and 
Analyst piece of ENA's PRC meetings to assist in facilitation.  Please advise 
when the ENA pre-rating meeting is scheduled.  Thank you for your cooperation.

The teams did an outstanding job getting the big issues wrapped up this 
weekend.  All units at all the 2000 peaker sites can now be dispatched 
commercially.  In Navy jargon, BZ!!

Though you and I will need to continue OEM discussions on commercial issues 
and punch list items, ENA now has 2920 Mw's of capacity available for 
dispatch.  This is a big milestone with significant value to Enron.

Please extend my appreciation to all concerned for the weekend wrap-up and 
the extended hours required to make it happen.

Dave, I am seeking your approval to take my group on an offsite to Las Vegas 
sometime in late 3rd/early 4th quarter. Cost is approx Cdn $1000/person for 
flight and accomodation (thursday - sunday). As you know, we have done this 
for a number of years but I'm not sure what approvals were obtained in the 
past as it was either your group or Lavorato's group at the time. This would 
involve Origination only as Trading is doing an offsite in conjunction with 
the rest of Shankman's group. It should be noted also that we decided not to 
attend the Masters this year as we didnt think it generated enough business 
following last years trip -  this cut our expenses substantially. Please let 
me know your thoughts on this.

The CA ISO Board met today and approved a plan to provide capacity subsidies

We offered 7 proposals.  Their decision criteria is ridiculous and subject to 
change, but it looks like we won the following:

1 LM6000 - 45MW - Pleasonton - $6.9MM per year for three years -  $153/kwyear

1 LM6000 - 45MW - LODI - $6.9MM per year for three years - $153/kwyear

4 FT4's - 96MW - Southern/Palo Alto - $13.2MM per year for three years - 
$137/kwyear

Las Vegas Cogen / EPMI 225MW Palo Verde Sale $10MM per year for three years - 
$44/kwyear

In the first three deals, we have the full rights to the energy; capacity 
payments are for availability.  These payments, combined with reasonable toll 
values, terminal value and EPC costs, make the projects economic (DASH 
forthcoming).

The last deal is a bit strange and non-conforming but the ISO likes it 
because it is priced very low.  Basically, we agree to deliver power to the 
ISO at the California border next summer priced at PX Index plus $20/MWh.  CA 
ISO takes power, sells into PX and receives Index.  This is cheaper than what 
they are paying for new capacity in state.  The $20 premium is simply the 
basis between Palo and SP15.  In 2002 and 2003, LVCogen commits to sell 500 
hours to CA ISO and receive PX for its energy.  In 02 and 03, the Palo/SP 
spread collapses so an asset buyer sees this $20MM as gravy.

Lot of moving parts - I will keep you posted.  Parquet, Mcdonald and Laird 
are doing a great job.

What do you think of a hostile bid for SOCO's transmission assets (Georgia 
Power, Gulf Power, Alabama Power, Savannah Electric, & Mississippi Power & 
Light), and a simultaneously create an ISO/RTO that is auctioned to the 
market.  This would clearly expedite the opening of markets in the SE 
significantly.

I think we could get an FPL, Duke, VEPCO, Entergy, Cinergy type company to 
provide a pre-negotiated purchase price for the transmission facilities so 
our capital at risk would be minimal.  Additionally, we would cut a deal with 
FERC on what the new market design would look like and the ultimate 
transmission owner would live with the market design.

What are your thoughts.

Subject: ENA Associate Candidate Question

Rich Cassano, an ENA Associate candidate with an outstanding offer, has asked 
if Enron would pay for he and his wife to visit Houston for prior to his 
making a decision to joining Enron. This candidate is from New York and has 
only been to Houston for the Super Saturday weekend. He feels that he can't 
make an informed decision on relocating without spending additional time in 
Houston.

The Associate Program does not cover this expense. Please let me know if you 
are willing to cover travel expenses for this candidate and for other 
candidates with a similar requests.

Dave, yes, I have upside on this week's East Midstream earnings.  Here's how 
it looks right now:

Great River Energy  $  875,000
Keyspan split              $4,000,000
Chicago Hub               $3,000,000

Total              $7,875,000


Yes, these earnings are real. GRE will be booked tomorrow (Ozzie is signing 
the contracts tonight), and Keyspan dollars will be finalized on Thursday. 
Chicago is really moving now. The Trunkline capacity is being executed today 
and tomorrow and will be booked tomorrow (@ $1,500,000 net to ENA), we traded 
out of 15 BCF of a storage hedge with the Utility and will recognize about 
$1,000,000 net to ENA tomorrow, and will take @ $500,000 to earnings from 
numerous other deals later this week. Let me know if you wish to discuss!!

Subject: Keyspan 


Quick update on Keyspan:  Gil Muhl flew to New York yesterday to spend the 
afternoon with Chuck Devario. It sounds like their meeting went very well as 
they spent a few hours discussing Keyspan's situation in the Northeast market 
and how an Enron/Keyspan ""JV"" would work. They actually outlined a lot of 
ideas on the white board and it basically sounds like Chuck is very 
interested in pursuing this JV that would focus on optimizing Keyspan's gas, 
power, and fuel oil portfolios. Chuck is now planning to come to Houston in 
mid-January to sit down with us and further these discussions. If the Houston 
visit goes well we will then plan to take him to Chicago to show him 
first-hand the Enron/People's JV (trading floor, office set-up, discussion of 
general contractual arrangements between the reg. utility and unreg. 
affiliate, etc.). Chuck knows Tom Patrick and it would be a great way to show 
him how well our Chicago JV has worked for both People's and Enron. Obviously 
this visit and meeting will need to be tightly finessed but I'm confident 
that with Laura Luce/Bill Morrow and Gil, Chuck, and myself, it will work.

We may want to consider getting out with Keyspan and People's together in a 
more social setting sometime in March (maybe the Master's would work). I 
think Keyspan has the ability to get out of the Coral relationship early if 
they really wanted to (it currently goes through April, 2002) although I 
think it will probably take the better part of next year to formulate the 
entire structure around this JV. I think the potential is to have a 
commercial structure in place and effective going into next winter or 
coinciding with the termination of the Keyspan/Coral relationship in April 
2002.

Okay, now the players needed to make this happen....Gil needs to be 
intimately involved. His knowledge of that market and company and his 
relationship with Devario, Anderson, Fazio, the operational folks, etc. is 
extremely good. If you decide that you do not want to have Gil involved in 
this (not a good decision) you need to move him out of his current role. 
Given the fact that we are using the People's JV as a showcase, Laura Luce 
can be very closely connected to Gil and Keyspan in a very natural and 
genuine way. Gil will need to lean on Laura's expertise in how she set up the 
Chicago JV throughout the process. I plan to insert Michael Brown into the 
deal team to focus on the power and fuel oil components. Michael has 
excellent relationships with all the folks at Keyspan and his knowledge of 
Keyspan's power portfolio and that power market will be critical. Ed 
McMichael will lead all the structuring effort (gas and maybe power too), and 
we'll need Bob Superty from the  operational side. 


Although it is still unclear as to whether Keyspan will decide to request 
proposals from several players, it is clear that with our overall 
capabilities and genuine desire to be flexible on the commercial structure in 
what we put together with them, Chuck Devario is very interested in pursuing 
more detailed discussions in the very near future.
 
I'd like you to be available to spend some time with Chuck and I when he 
comes to Houston in January ( maybe  a late morning meeting and lunch) and 
I'll coordinate with Kay on that.

Let me know if you want to talk about this ahead of time. I'll be here all 
next week.

Scott,

I would like to re-emphasize our commitment to you and your team in ensuring 
this project is successful.  As we had discussed we are very eager to provide 
Project Management services for the Millenia project.  In fact Audrey and I 
am visiting BCCK this Friday to be sure we are not leaving anything else on 
the table which Enron could capture.  We in fact have identified one of our 
PMs, who has over 20 years experience in the industry, to lead the project.  
He will be augmented by Audrey who is not only a terrific process engineer 
but is managing the Lost Creek process plant/compressor station intallation 
in Wyoming.

My team is also managing the implementation of the Fort Union Gas Gathering 
project in Wyoming.

I understand things are heating up and all of us are looking forward to you 
kicking off the project.  Please feel free to call me at x58273.

Nick-

Per our conversation, Ward Polzin from the Producer Finance Group mentioned 
that during their presentation to Dave Delaney with Ray Bowen-VP Commercial 
and Scott Josey, the subject of who would do the project management for Enron 
came up.  Ward said my name was mentioned and that Ray Bowen said that if I 
couldn't he knew of a group from Power that did Project Management.

I would highly recommend you step in quickly offering our services before the 
decision is made to use someone else.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Subject: Las Vegas CoGen

Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position 
in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA 
could create significant value from a project that we have very little 
invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone 
and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, 
as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will 
argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to 
maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant 
dollars or taking significant risks.

Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.

Subject: Toronto Opportunity

Dave:

Just prior to the Holidays, I wrote an e-mail to Paul Devries (I copied you) 
that outlined how my experience could help the Toronto office expand 
business. As I indicated in my e-mail, my career interest, and my view of the 
needs of the Toronto office, is for a role that would look more like cash 
trading/services transaction management rather than pure coverage.  Paul and 
I agree that there is not enough happening in the cash trading/services area 
right now to warrant my move to Toronto.  We are hopeful that at some point 
within the next year, this will not be the case and Garrett Tripp will find 
himself too busy to effectively manage what needs to be done.  This probably 
will occur soon after market opening, rather than before.  At that time, I 
could be ready to go quickly.  If market conditions change so that my skills 
are not a real good fit, than we would not make the move.  I am confident I 
can stay abreast of Ontario market issues from Portland to limit any learning 
curve once a move happens.

I think Paul is comfortable with this plan.  He was going to run it by Rob.   
Please let me know if you are OK with this plan as well.

Thanks again for the consideration.

Chris

Subject: Change to the Inga DASH

The Approval Amount for the Inga DASH has been revised from $98 million to 
$105.25 million to accomodate the potential requirement of having to replace 
existing credit support facilities provided by the seller, A. Ahlstrom, or 
the target, Ahlstrom Development Corporation (""ADC"").  Although not explicit, 
this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain 
""change-in-ownership"" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete 
Enron's acquisition of ADC.  As we believe that the liklihood of this 
requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH 
reflects the aggregate of these amounts.  The requirement with regard to 3) 
below lies with an ADC subsidiary and should not ""reasonably"" merit 
replacement by Enron.

This change was reflected in the DASH mailed to the Finance Committee of the 
BoD on 12/05/00.

The potential credit support facilities are detailed as follows:

1)  Panther Creek -- A. Ahlstrom Comfort Letter:  A. Ahlstrom provided a  
""comfort letter"" for the benefit of the lenders at the Panther Creek 
project.  Upon acquisition by Enron, the beneficiaries of this comfort letter 
may require that it be replaced by an ENE guaranty.  The comfort letter 
requires A. Ahlstrom to provide up to $1.5 MM in additional equity to the 
project in the event that the project cannot meet its debt service.

Based on the origination team's analysis, the likelihood of an equity call 
related to the comfort letter appears to be minimal given:  
the project  is projected to achieve an average 1.92x debt service coverage 
ratio in the pro forma model
the partnership maintains business interruption insurance
the project can subordinate $2MM in O&M incentive payments annually to meet 
its debt service targets

2)  Panther Creek -- Equity Support Agreements:  ADC, as well the other major 
partner, Constellation, have provided guarantees in favor of the Panther 
Creek project lenders, each with a maximum exposure of $5.75 MM  Equity 
support under this agreement may be called on if the Panther Creek project 
does not meet its debt service requirements.  We believe that these 
obligations should be maintained by ADC and not up-streamed to Enron as Enron 
obligations, however, the consenting parties may disagree.

In the event that Enron is required to provide this support in exchange for 
consent, the origination team believes it is unlikely that the project 
lenders will call on the equity support agreements due to the coverage ratio, 
insurance and payment subordination items discussed above under item 1) above.

3)  Gilberton -- Capital Support Agreement:  Orion Power Company (a 
subsidiary of ADC) has committed to providing a maximum of $1.25 MM in equity 
support to the Gilberton Power Project, in the event that debt service cannot 
be met.  We have not provided for this in the DASH as we believe that these 
obligation should be maintained by Orion and not upstreamed to either ADC or 
Enron as either an ADC or Enron obligation.

The origination team believes that if Enron is called upon to provide this 
credit support, the impact of such would be minimal because:
the agreement expires once project debt is repaid in Dec 2002
the project maintains a cash debt service reserve of $16 MM (and only $32 MM 
of debt reamains outstanding)
pro forma debt service coverage ratios average 1.53x against a target of 1.15x

Given there is minimal expectation the facilities will be drawn upon, RAC 
does not foresee a material impact on the overall project economics.  To the 
extent guarantees or letters of credit are issued, an appropriate cost for 
these guarantees should be deducted from the value of the transaction.

Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to this change.

Subject: Re: Idea  

Put a bid into SOCO's shareholders for the transmission assets only.  Since 
the market is valuing Genco assets at a much higher multiple, a bid at book 
value for the transco would be very intriguing to the existing shareholder 
base.

Given a high probability of supply shortage in Florida over the next 2-4 
years, the transmission gateway to Florida is extremely valuable, 
particularly if expansions are done off the existing system.

In addition, it would give Enron tremendous regulatory leverage with the 
pending Entergy/FPL (SOCO connects systems), and the entire SE market, 
including TVA.

I know it's a longshot, but we will have to do something radical to bust open 
the SE market into a free functioning commodity market.  The SE is 
essentially untapped from a power trading standpoint right now, and the 
market is nearly 200,000 MW if you include Florida.

I'm having Mitch scrub the economics one more time.   In general, however, 
the capital expense is very hard to justify given the fact we ran only 200 
hours last year (1000 hour total permit) and the forward curve suggests we 
will run 300-400 hours per year.

Spending capital $'s for lower CO and NOx is hard to justify when the 
additional run hours are not valued from a trading perspective.

  I need more information on the project and who exactly the individuals are 
who you feel should participate in this program.  Generally, developers and

since this type of work is part of their job.  However, this project may be

Subject: ENA Comp suggestions for Project Raptor

I have been discussing with Dave Delainey how we might align the 
compensation/rewards for the group of 4 or 5 VP's and Directors we have 
assigned to disposing of our large portfolio ($650mm). The project is due to 
complete in June 01 and Dave and my concern is whether we can make sure they 
are motivated to close on time and get the best possible price for us. Dave 
believe the up side could be as much as $150mm and the downside as much as 
$300mm (the difference between best and worst prices/sales).

My suggestion is that we do the following and I would like your comments or 
concerns if any:

Enter into contracts or an agreement (the later would be one way - us to them 
and obviously easier) with each of them outlining the following:

Bonus targets based on financial targets and PRC performance for calendar 01 
(ie if you rank in top 3 categories and you realise over $650 from this 
project we will pay you not less than $300k)

Equity award on closing, on the basis of successful closure and above line 
value (ie only in the event that this closes in June 01 and realises more 
than $650mm we will grant you $200k in options, if above $800m then $350k in 
options.)

Dave would like for me to get back to him on this asap.

David

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and 
agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal 
we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way 
forward.  Adam

Subject: Indian Mesa

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Delainey

party in Kevin Hannon's house for summer associates last year, the 
conversation was quite enjoyable and I was greatly impressed by your 
experience with Enron.  

Just want to say hello and please accept my best wishes in this holiday 
season! And I wonder whether you would be kind enough to have time for lunch 
or coffee sometime.

All the best!

Li

ENA Mid-Year 2000 Senior Management and High Value Contributors Equity Awards

Mary,

As discussed yesterday, I have had further discussions with Dave and John on 
this subject and we would like to proceed as follows;

- Wait for mid-year PRC discussions to conclude July 7
- Make recommendations for option grants to key first 6 month contributors 
and new management players following week
- Strike equity and communicate to recipients Aug 1

The rationale for this would be as follows:

- ENA has had a stellar first 6 months and will probably over exceed plan by 
$150mm
- 5 or 6 individuals have been instrumental in creating exceptional value and 
we would like to recognise their performance now.
- A number of people have over the last 6 months been asked to step up and 
take more senior roles following the moves to EBS and ENW. We would like to 
recognise these people now (subject to top 2 PRC performance) by granting 
them some options.
- As a consequence of some people's increased responsibilities and in looking 
at their unvested equity value, a number of people appear low in relation to 
the market.

I would anticipate that the individual awards would be of 7 year options with 
standard vesting and would mainly be of individual 5-10,000 options awards 
(or $145-$290k). These might total in the region of 150-250,000 options.

While most of the probable recipients will be commercial officers, I would 
expect a number of senior support and some Commercial Directors also to be 
recommended.

Obviously I understand that we will need to put individual cases together for 
each recipient for board submission but I would appreciate your help and 
guidance as we proceed. In particular please alert me asap if you think this 
will be a problem.

Thanks

David

Subject: Transportation Status

Scott Neal told me that you asked recently where we stood on development of a 
transportation market in light of 637.  I would be happy to meet with you and 
let you know in more detail what I have been working on, but here is a quick 
synopsis.

We are putting new transportation products out on EOL--this should be ready 
for December business (assuming Lavo has no objections--I just sent him the 
information on the product).  They are simple products with no computerized 
interaction between EOL and Sitara or EOL and the pipeline bulletin boards 
(which we are still required to post through per the pipeline tariffs).  
Quite honestly, I have no idea how much activity these will generate since 
each product still has the potential for being ""biddable"" on the pipeline 
EBBs and there is not an easy solution around that.  Also, all completed 
transactions still must be posted on the EBBs and confirmed by the pipelines 
before the deal is actually completed.  This product does not make the 
release process any simpler; however, it does make it more visible by having 
bids and offers out on EOL, where people are more likely to be looking than 
the pipeline EBB.

The vision is to have the entire bidding and confirmation process through the 
EBBs automated, which would encourage a significant increase in trading 
activity for transportation, but there are several important infrastructure 
steps we must take first--you know, minor things like creating a 
transportation position screen in Sitara and getting the pipelines' EDI 
(Electronic Data Interchange) mechanisms in working form.  We are in testing 
with 9 pipelines as of today.

Also, as I'm sure you are aware, Julie Gomez is working with several 
pipelines to put their available IT (interruptible) space out on EOL (the 
last I heard this should happen for January business), and then I understand 
that she plans to work with EOL to allow third parties to put transportation 
bids and/or offers out on EOL in an ""Altra-like"" system--meaning ENA will not 
always be a party to those transactions.  

There are many changes occurring because of Order 637, but the pipelines are 
still going through their compliance filings and there are alot of complaints 
about those filings--which just means more time for implementation.

If you have any questions, please call me at x35514.

Subject: Moore Power Plant

Dave,
Re schedule:
1.  We are proceeding with the kick-off of the permit amendment, and will be 
using a combination of both the MCN and Calumet N2 unit data.  Per my phone 
message, it will take about a week or two to prepare the amendment at a cost 
up to $10,000 US, and then eight weeks to get the amendment.  We should be 
able to commence site work without the amendment, to the point of completing 
foundations, based on previous discussions with the Municipality, County and 
Ontario Ministry of Envir..
Even though this work is not in our $35 MM US original DASH budget, we are 
planning to proceed with this unless you've got a problem with it.
2.  NEPCO have preliminarily re-worked the schedule now on the N1 
disassembly, move and install, and the N2 installation.  They believe they 
need to get on site by the third week in June to begin site clearing in order 
to initiate foundation work by mid July.  Between June 15 and July 15 they 
would do the foundation design - this should be on the generous side given 
that we had done some foundation design last fall, and with MCN at least have 
some of the N2 foundation work already done by ABB.
Whether it's June 21 or 30 to start the site clearing, the schedule is 
getting tight.

Re capital cost estimate:
3.  NEPCO is able to complete the revised capital cost estimate on the N1/N2 
case by June 9th at the latest (they're looking at moving it up to the 5th or 
6th if they work the weekend).  They have a problem at the moment as they are 
moving offices over this weekend and will lose about 4 days.  They will have 
a revised estimate on the N1 case by the end of next week - it looks today 
like the cost savings for no acceleration and winter work and being able to 
barge the units versus railing them, will all be worth at least $2 MM US. 
I'm assuming we would take the capital costs estimate into our DASH as soon 
as the estimate is ready and go for approval, so that we can meet schedule - 
I'm not sure where you stand on the ""roll-up"" approval on Moore, Pastoria and 
Las Vegas if the latter two don't go into Genco.
Meanwhile, progress through RAC on the DASH continues.

Re N2 units:
4.  We continue to sort out whether the Calumet units might work from a noise 
and water perspective.  We still haven't seen the MCN/Columbus counter on the 
other units but they claim it's coming.

Subject: SADAF

You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how 
the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us.

Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF.  
We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within 
two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be 
forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA 
negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is 
signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.

We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, 
and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed 
with or without this specific turbine.  

Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.  
However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a 
bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.

If Delaney has a firm ""bird in the hand"" he should take the turbine.  
Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want 
to take the turbine.

My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.

Rick

I need ASAP-- South America is going home & they are off tomorrow ----Thanks, 
kay


On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, 
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide 
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that 
are underway to restructure  Enron,s operations in South America.  The basic 
organizational framework has been set. 

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and 
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting 
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility; 
however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination, 
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe,s focus will 
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall 
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO 
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding 
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in 
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark 
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and 
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our 
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being 
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets 
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South 
America will be organized around the highly successful North American network 
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical 
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value 
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and 
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to 
Joe and Orlando:
 
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will  
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine 
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services 
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital 
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the 
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value 
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move 
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the 
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America 
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal 
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who 
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, 
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, 
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. 

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The 
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book 
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales 
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively 
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible 
for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct 
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas 
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American 
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we 
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.  

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization 
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support 
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team 
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in 
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business 
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as 
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston 
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements 
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will 
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as 
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, 
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a 
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will 
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this 
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory 
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick 
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the 
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his 
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will 
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be 
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the 
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and 
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal 
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron 
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information 
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will 
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial 
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting 
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron 
Wholesale Services ) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale 
Services ) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and 
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our 
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new 
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the 
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly 
affected will be notified shortly.
 
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its 
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are 
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create 
shareholder value.

Hi Dave,
I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you regarding the roles 
that certain individuals played in closing the Project 20/20 transaction and 
provide you with input on how to rationalize bonus amounts relative to 
everyone's performance rankings and contributions to 20/20.  I am open to 
your suggestion as to when and how best to convey my thoughts on this issue.

Hope you had a good holiday and look forward to talking with you soon.

Brian

"Re: Bridgeline","Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved.  
It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.

The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include:
 a) improving the financial performance of the entity;
 b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure 
matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in 
every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only 
benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis;
 c) continue to move from the ""heavy lifting"" approach to becoming the 
""smartest pipe"" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your 
people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover 
advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors 
(ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and 
aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and
 d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.

My time and resources are at your disposal.

"Reporting Structure","Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

Delainey

Subject: Reporting Structure

Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to ""stay 
in the loop"" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards
Milnthorp

"ENA Offsite 2000","Guys, in coordination with your trading partners, can you start putting 
together your offsite presentations.  Each group will have approximately one 
hour to one hour and half.  A suggested format would include (for East Power, 
East Gas, West Power, Canada (power and gas), Central Gas and West Gas):
  a) market overview - including supply/demand, structural changes, etc;
  b) strategy and opportunities in 2001(include five new trading/origination 
opportunities for 2001);
  c) expected 2001 new products/structures, coverage and deal flow;
  d) what worked in 2000 what didn't;
  and e) organization and resources - people, assets, constraints, etc.

In a nutshell, we want you to share with the group how your market works, 
where the opportunties lie and how are you positioning yourself to take 
advantage of those opportunties in order to reach your financial and other 
goals in 2001.  

Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy 
lifting; however, they need your first cut by December 8th.

Subject: meeting w/Enron Wind

I am contacting you to confirm our meeting with you and some of your 
colleagues next Wed. June 14th, 3-4PM.  Attending on Enron Wind's behalf will 
be Kurt Huneke and Adam Umanoff (MD, Commercial Americas)

In the last two months Enron completed the acquisition of the minority shares 
(~20%) in Enron Wind Corp.   As a result of this decision, Enron has also 
made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our 
return in this industry.

One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the 
various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.  As the regulatory 
environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are 
evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position.

We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin 
Presto were available to join us as well.  Please feel free to invite anyone 
else you feel would be appropriate.  As you may know, we have begun to 
discuss some of these opportunities with EPMI and we are encouraged by the 
way we see the market developing.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this meeting.

Thank you,
Michael Payne

Thanks for the quick response, Joe.  Peter did call me earlier this 
afternoon, and I transferred him to Dave Delainey.  Unfortunately, I failed 
to get his phone number before transferring him, but I understand from Dave's 
assistant that he left Dave a voicemail.  I'm sure he left his number there.  
I did, however, gleen from him that he and his investors already own the 50 
buildings (not in the process of buying them as I originally thought) and 
have +/- 100 additional properties they manage.

I'm stepping out of the middle of this one now unless there is anything 
further you need me to do.  Good luck - I hope it's a real deal - I've never 
had origination next to my name before!  SRS

Sherri,

We would be quite interested in looking into this further.  We are currently 
working with quite a few companies to sell power under 3-5 year contract 
terms.  The customers range from large office bldgs (>2Mw and connected to 
EHV grid) to large industrials (several hundred Mw).  We are also making some 
real progress with the real estate companies and department stores to provide 
power to a number of their facilities across Japan.  There are a number of 
other initiatives where we would take an industrials self generation off 
balance sheet, upgrade facility, etc to give us access to power.  In one case 
we are progressing with a company that has 600 Mw inside the fence.

Let me know how you would like to progress.  As a point of interest, a 
particular discount product that we are offering is fully described on our 
biligual website (www.enron.co.jp).  This has been very successful for us.

Gentlemen,

You will receive a phone call from Peter Wachtell sometime over the next 
week.  I spoke to his father last night at a dinner party; Peter is putting 
together a deal in Tokyo right now to purchase 50 office buildings and manage 
another 100.  He is interested in talking to Enron about energy outsourcing.

I'm assured that this a legitimate deal, but that will be for you to decide!  
Just wanted to give you a heads up in the hopes you will take a few minutes 
to talk to him.

Subject: 4Q Earnings from ENA Principal Investments

We have now refined our initial estimates for potential 4Q fair value 
earnings on each of our portfolio investments:

Dais-Analytic ($8.27 MM) - DAC has signed an agreement with Lucky Goldstar of 
Korea which includes a $5 MM minority equity investment at a pre-money 
valuation equal to $147.9 MM.  The agreement has been signed, is legally 
binding, can not be unilaterally terminated by LG and transfer of money will 
happen as soon as LG receives Korean central bank approval.  (Note:  We could 
take an additional $3.55 MM gain, or $11.8 MM aggregate, if we chose to 
exercise our option to invest $4.5 MM in DAC prior to year end)

Encorp ($14.1 MM) - Encorp has received a term sheet from Ballentine Capital 
which values the company at $100 MM pre-money.  Beacon Capital and Goldman 
Sachs have both passed on making an investment at $100 MM.  Given current 
market conditions, we believe a pre-money valuation of $90 MM is more 
realistic and closer to what Ballentine will ultimately do the deal at.  The 
$14.1 MM figure corresponds to a valuation of $90 MM.   

Solo Energy ($1.5 MM) - the downturn in the equity markets has had its effect 
on Solo's fund raising.  Chase H&Q has solicited a number of investors in the 
market, including Beacon, Perseus, Stephens (Little Rock) and Ballentine and 
all are interested and reviewing.  Charlie's sense is that the term sheets 
that we should receive by year end will be at a valuation lower than the $80 
MM that H&Q has been advertising to the company (and us).  The $1.5 MM figure 
corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $60 MM, which we view as more 
realistic.

Metering Technology Corp. ($1.0 MM) - Aqua International Partners has agreed 
to invest $15 MM at a pre-money valuation of $45 MM.  

Power Systems Mfg LLC ($0.72 MM) - the principals of PSM have agreed to sell 
the company to Calpine for $43 MM, making our warrant worth $1.72 MM.  Enron 
will receive cash for the warrant upon closing of the deal.  PSM's proceeds 
will be paid out over a 2-3 year period.

Utiliquest - we learned in November that Utiliquest had lost its bid to 
retain the Atlanta area locating business of BellSouth, Atlanta Gas & Light, 
Metromedia (Cable TV) and Georgia Power.  This was obviously disappointing to 
us - and symptomatic of the performance which led me to replace Utiliquest's 
CEO just prior to the award of Atlanta bid (which went to STS, a subsidiary 
of Dycom).  The initial indication from the company was that - while Atlanta 
represented $20 MM in revenues (roughly 20% of total revenues) - there would 
be a proportionately smaller change in EBITDA and the bottom line.  After 
further analysis - conducted in connection with our planned divestiture - we 
have determined that there will likely be a $2-3 MM reduction in EBITDA for 
2000.  Our anticipated EBITDA exit multiple is 6-7x 2000 figures.  I need to 
discuss a revaluation of Utiliquest in more detail with Kevin, Wes Colwell 
and Andrea Reed.

Total comes to $25.6 MM plus whatever we determine is achievable on 
Utiliquest. 

Please call if you have any questions.

I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.  I 
strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team 
on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and 
financial aspects of this project.  This is the only way to be effective. 
Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent

I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are 
not buried in this project given other goals and objectives.

Dave,

I am sorry that I was unable to meet with you yesterday on Cuiba.  Jim has 
told me what the two of you decided and it is fine with me.  Below is a note 
that I received this morning from Pete.  The meeting he is referencing is an 
indepth update on the project that I requested a week ago.  You are more than 
welcome to attend if you would like to - just let me know.

I am not sure that Pete is the right guy to work this or not, but I do agree 
that we need to introduce someone else into the process - I am thinking 
either Chris Hunt or Mariella Mahan.  I would be happy to discuss with you 
why I recommend one of those two individuals.

Subject: Cuiaba I Team

the list below is going to Delainey - it is accurate from my perspective - if 
the project ends up in your shop for completion and fixing up - and if it 
ends up under me - some of these part time guys should become full time and 
some of the full time guys should take a back seat.

I would have the full time dedicated team be - 

Jose Bestard (he currently is chief of regulatory for South America) - he 
negotiated the original PPA and has indepth knowledge of how the regulatory 
system does and does not work.

Joao Carlos Alberquerque - top notch Brazilian power expert - has the right 
contacts and relationships and can get us through the maze of Brazilian 
resistance.  Currently he is headed for wholesale merchant.

John Novak - best legal mind - needs to curb the use of outside lawyers a bit 
- has been on the project continuous from day one - and needs to be 
rejuvenated a bit - but has thourough understanding of how bthe entire 
project is wired together.

Rob Gay - Finance 

Laine Powell - is currently President of the oeprating companies - Cuiaba is 
producing 300 mw of power which is being sold and paid for.

Felipe Ospina - modeler - I don't know this guy -  he is relatively new to 
the project and seems satisfactory

Would recommend also a fresh set of eyes on the project - not front line 
negotiator - but someone good at structuring - or work outs - to review 
overall project structure objectively and challange conventional wisdom. 

Other folks on the list below can support the dedicated team - part time.

Would tell these guys - this is your only job - and here is your starting 
point - new deal.  Your job is not just to close financing - it is to get 
Enron's money out or otherwise improve the returns of the project.    You 
will get paid based on this point forward.   It will take at least 9 months 
to implement a solution that improves our returns or gest more than just 
financial close achieved.

This leaves some sticky situations - Rick Lammers has absolutely busted his 
ass getting things done and moving the project forward - he has been lead 
developer - but has had lots of ""help"" from Bannantine and the entire team.   
Help tended to obscure responsibility and accountability.  I am not sure 
anyone could have gotten this thing done by now - but certainly there were 
some things that could have been done better - in 20/20 hindsight  - and some 
things that can be done better now.  The things that come be done better now 
- I am pushing into Laines's area of responsibility this week.  People need 
to get rededicated and fired back up - I also think it is kind of difficult 
to ""take over"" the project without making some changes in the way it is being 
run.   

For the review on Monday - I have asked the following people to present -

Rick Lammers
Laine Powell
Jose Bestard

Also in attendance will be John Novak, Joe Kishkill, Brett Wiggs, Rob Gay and 
myself.

The guys asked if Jim Bannantine should be present - I said no - let me know 
if you would like him there.

You should see - a brief description of the overall project (not the strategy 
- just how it is wired together- where the money is intended to be be) and 
then straight to a listing of all things that need to get done to ""finish"" 
the project to the point where we have financial close and a functioning 
supply and PPA.

Joe and I and Rob will be in Houston and the rest of the team will dial in a 
conference call. 

Let me know if the above format is ok.

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Subject: Ada pump and QF concerns in general

I wasn't sure whether you were messing with me or serious during the QBR 
about the Ada boiler pump.  It was a $10k issue which was fixed in the normal 
course of operations and NBD in the scope of things.  The QF was never at 
risk as the pump is a standard part which is commonly available.

The QF loss issue I typically worry about usually derive from an outage 
sourced at the counterparty level (cashflow problems, operational 
difficulties, etc.)  I've seen this cause a few projects tense moments, 
although FERC has always allowed the projects to recover.  Typically the 
utility will protest the loss of QF but since the QF's are self-certifying 
with FERC right to protest, the utility can typically only make noise and or 
cease paying.  

Recently, FPL attempted to not let the Indiantown QF IPP back on-line after a 
technical shutdown (and thereby bust their QF), but FPL lost their case in 
court (wrongful act) and has had to let the project return to on-line status 
(financing and QF remained intact over the +6 month ordeal).

To me the general theme is that an executed and performing (energy is being 
delivered) PPA will survive incredible QF stress.  The plant managers 
typically have the highest level of understanding of the intricacies of the 
PPA's vis-a-vis the relationship between plant, utility and QF host.  
Historically, FERC is not looking to kick out a project's contract based upon 
a QF technicality, although charged with enforcement of QF.  If FERC was a 
tough enforcer, Cleburne and a few other similar QF projects would rate high 
on their hit list and the past speaks well to the future in this case.

"C-Gas","Jeff, I don't believe the offer I showed you of $39 M is unreasonable. In 
fact the team had recommended $42 M based on a number of measures.  I see the 
6X multiple of annualized Q2 earnings as one of the best measures of the 
potential value of this company.

I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below 
a reasonable market value between business units.  You can trust that I will 
be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the 
realization of this value if you do not purchase the company.

If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value, I will 
support that transaction.

Subject: C-Gas

Dave,  I have ask Steve Harper, Jack Harmuth, Howard Selzer,and  Glenn Fox to 
work with Steve Pruitt and see if the number you offered can be supported.  
The value for proved developed reserves and the financial/legal issues can be 
reviewed rather painlessly here in Houston.  The value for the  proved 
undeveloped reserves will most likely require a visit to the working team to 
see the program particulars, verify the acreage and , concluded the validity 
of this estimate of PUD value.  The idea of paying before tax NPV10% for an 
assumed 3.5 year program on top of the PD &PUD reserves will require a more 
indepth review.  

Obviously, we want to do this as simply as possible and I was prepared to 
take the package ""as is, where is"" at book value which I understood to be in 
the 30-32MM$ range including debt.  Dave I understand what you are doing and 
I would support this effort if we were selling the asset outside of the 
company.   I want to do what is best for Enron at this time which I believe 
is to transfer this asset to EGEP for the reasons i outlined in my prior 
memo.  It will benefit C-gas via direct access to technology and specialists, 
it will benefit EGEP for marketing and a US presence and it will benefit ENA 
by moving the asset from your books without a loss and releasing the valuable 
intellectual capital ENA could employ elsewhere in a higher yielding business 
venture.  However, with the premiums you have placed on the properties it is 
going to be very difficult to make this transaction happen.  (However, we are 
willing to try)  ENA has had this on the market for over a year with the 
intent to sell it at book if possible.  Prices have improved, but I believe 
even your team would admit this is still a project to get book in the market 
today.  Your estimated value at the current strip at a Before Tax 10% 
discount for Appalachian reserves seems a little aggressive for the market 
let alone an inter-company transfer.  

When we talked about this a couple of weeks ago we said it would be a fair 
transaction and at the time you were hedging that it would be around book.  I 
understood your logic for needing to talk with your team but I was relying on 
a fair deal to result.  Dave, I'm only sending this memo to you because I 
feel this is being pushed way past fair by your team with the intent that if 
we pay this it is a home run for your new team and since we are in a bind, 
let's see what happens.  I know this is a very small piece of business for 
you and the time it takes to read this is more than you can afford to this 
asset or transaction.  If fact,  the easy thing for you to do is get mad and 
say you don't have the time and stop the transaction.  On the other hand, if 
you believe the right thing for all parties is to do this at book, say so and 
you'll never deal with this piece of business again.  I hope in this case you 
will put the greater good of Enron in front of ENA's desire to hit a home run 
at EGEP's expense and in the spirit of ONE-ENRON move these assets to EGEP at 
book value.  
As I said in the beginning we will try to get to your number, but I am 
concerned that we will spend a lot of time and require effort from all of the 
teams that could be eliminated if you and I decided to make this transaction 
at book.  In fact, it would be the easiest transition for the C-Gas team 
which you've indicated to be a concern for your team.  I am available through 
voice mail and I can get my lotus notes most days.  Best thing is to leave a 
voice mail and a good time for me to call you back.

Thanks Dave for your time,
Jeff

Enron has contracted with Cognitive Arts to develop a web-based training 
system to be available for use by all of Enron,s management.

The goals of this project are to:

Enhance communication in the five key areas identified from the recent ETC 
survey (the percentages indicate the number of employees agreeing with the 
following statements):
59%: Decisions are not communicated well
54%: Employees do not feel free to voice their opinions openly
55%: The company doesn,t act effectively on employee suggestions
70%: Communication is not good across departmental lines
61%: Employees are not encouraged to challenge established procedures and 
policies

You have been identified as someone who?gives?valuable feedback.  I am asking 
for approximately one and a half hours of your time to have an informal, 
on-camera conversation with  Cognitive Arts so that we can capture your 
stories and insights for inclusion into the system.  CogArts will be in 
Houston conducting these interviews during the week of October 23rd.  If you 
are available to  take part in these interviews, CogArts and myself  will 
contact you the week of October 16th to brief you on  the specific topics 
that will be covered and to answer any questions you may have.  Please let 
Stacey Dempsey, ext. 30945,  know if you would be available for an interview 
and when would be a good time for me to answer your questions.  Thank you for 
your support.

Also, I am attaching a document that briefly desribes the interview process- 
what to expect, how to prepare and it gives some suggestions on how you can 
shape your responses to make them as effective as possible.

Subject: Houston Meeting


Dave,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the issues and opportunities facing
our companies. I did not expect to have such an audience. I came seeking
business advice on the litigation and feel I accomplished a lot more. I
apologize for not contacting you directly, but I was unaware that you were
now responsible for all of the groups within ENA.   Congratulations !!!!!

Here is what I came away with:

Litigation
GE has proposed a settlement that includes a proposed press release
unacceptable to PSM. I have our attorneys working on drafting a response to
GE and pursing the possibility of eliminating the joint press release
altogether. If common ground cannot be reached we will pursue other legal
options.

Private Placement
The book has been released to Enron & Calpine. I understand your position
concerning participation and the question of the ongoing litigation. I am
very open to the additional warrant option. Mike Miller talked to me about
it after the meeting and we will discuss it next week.

New Albany Retrofit
I have asked my engineers to formulate a plan to upgrade the units at New
Albany with our latest 6 ppm liners and fuel nozzles. We are currently
manufacturing a full set for a 7EA machine. We haven't firmed up the test
dates but we need to seek approval by ENA & OEC to use one of the Doyle
machines. This is a significant leap in technology that many of our clients
are extremely interested in. We now have the only single digit dry low Nox
system that can be used on multiple machine types to include Westinghouse
501D5A, ABB 11 N1/N2, GE F6 / F7.

FT4 Mobile Unit
I understand from Mike Miller you want to slow the pace down on the first
ten units to ""Learn out"" the manufacturing and business process. This will
ease our pain level on schedule. My engineering staff is very excited with
this program because it involves aircraft engines and they can apply their
true skills. We just hired the program manager named George Kirsby. He is
currently in charge of the $4 billion Joint Strike Fighter engine design
program for Pratt Whitney / Boeing. I figure he should be able to manage the
mobile unit project. At some time in the near future I would like to arrange
a program presentation for you in Houston. I need to give Kirsby a few weeks
to get his arms around the project and will propose dates for you in the
future. We need to expedite the formation of the Joint Venture company as we
are already being approached with deals to place these units.

I really value your support and you can always count on our loyalty to
Enron.

Please note:
The numbers for the PX Credit have increased based on a more complete 
valuation.  
The P/X Credit MTM exposures are not netted against EES payables of T&D (with 
netting there would be an estimated $200mm reduction in PX Credit exposure)
All MTM numbers are valued at the Mid Curves.
Enron Wind numbers are being reviewed.
Portland General, ISO and PX exposures are estimates from last week and need 
to be updated.

Dave,

I know you want to have a meeting about the east desk as a follow up to last 
weeks meeting.  Do you think it would be helpful for me to have this 
replicated for all desks for one meeting?  Or do you want just 1 
presentation, and I will manage the rest of the rollout to the other desks? 

Thanks.  Jeff

Dave and John --

In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt 
in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get 
started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the 
arrangements.  Please advise.

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for 
traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.

"Power Systems","Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

from HR to offer these individuals a spot in the program and possibly a

How do you want the Technical Analysis group handled for yearend PRC?  It is 
my understanding that they report directly to the OOC and as such, will not 
be included in any of the other business unit PRC's (i.e. EIM, East Orig, 
etc.).  Options are:

1. Have a tech analysis prc for the approx. 24 employees (portland and 
houston based) and the ratings are final  (however, who will give ratings for 
Mays and Virgo)
2. We ask one of the commercial teams to allow them to be discussed in their 
meeting (which will give cross  calibration and consensus).
3. Explore the possiblity of including them in a ""functional"" meeting with 
OEC or EECC?

Please give me your thoughts!

Subject: Ronnie Lee-Walton


I called Ronnie Lee to invite him to the New York Christmas party (he'll 
probably come) and we had a lengthy conversation about what they're doing 
right now.
It sounds like they are down to 4 counterparties on their previous ""asset 
management"" solicitation:  Enron, Southern, Duke and Williams.  Williams is 
their first choice at the moment purely driven on price. It sounds like 
Williams is willing to effectively provide natural gas at a  below-market 
fixed price. Both Williams and Duke were comparable on price. Enron and 
Southern are close on price and just behind the Duke/Williams pricing. 
Although Ronnie claims everyone is ""right there together"", the small pricing 
difference is significant when looked at over 15 years. Williams will be with 
Ronnie soon (next couple weeks) to begin discussing contract language. He 
says documents aren't signed and I can tell he really wanted us to be at the 
table. We priced our last deal to him about 4 weeks ago and I believe the gas 
curve was higher than it is currently. Ronnie agrees that it would be 
worthwhile to reprice our deal since the prices were so close before. He said 
Jackson has  now joined Walton, Colquitt, and Satilla and they would like to 
come to terms on a definitive document in the December/January timeframe.  

I talked with him about Oglethorpe and Tom Smith, and he was very interested 
to find out we'd been meeting with them. He thinks Oglethorpe will only keep 
about 40% of the existing Oglethorpe load. He'd like to sit down and talk 
thru all this after we re-price our deal and I told him that Ozzie would be 
in touch to try and set up a time. 

Although I hadn't really planned to call Ronnie on this, I thought it 
probably wouldn't be bad to stir things up a bit!

for me to have dinner - get Beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and

story.  All these guys acknowledge that without our Trading stamp on NewCo, 
NewCo will not be a world class Genco.  With that said, it is apparent that 
Lew is telling these guys to go back and get more EXACT detail on what 
exactly Enron is willing to do in terms of people (both Trading and Risk 
Management). I would have to believe that a conversation between you and Lew 
would go a long way in making him comfortable that we are truly committed to 
NewCo, particularly with $400-$500 million of equity tied up in this entity.  
Apparently we have to arm Lew with everything that he needs to go to 
Broadhead to argue why NewCo makes sense and why they need Enron in this 
entity.  I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people, it 
is also philosophy, style and approach.  Given that we have said that we 
would nominate the Head Trader, I have tried to convey that we might be 
looking to utilize a lot of FPLE T&M people, but immerse them in our 
philosophy.  They are not comfortable with this, and have informed me that 
coming back with the answer that we will only put one Enron person in Trading 
is probably not the right answer.  Given the dynamic nature of Enron and 
Trading in general,  making a huge commitment of people I would imagine will 
be tough.

We talked through many other aspects including whether they think that they 
can do an IPO without us; the fact that having our involvement clearly 
increases the value of NewCo (raises an interesting question about how we get 
adequately compensated for this);  tight labor market in general and the fact 
that we don't have unlimited human resources here at Enron; and that in the 
early years, NewCo has very little merchant generation, and that all of it is 
FPLE 's (implies fewer people needed, and that we should be able to utilize 
FPLE Traders).  We also discussed the rumor about FPL's interest in Aquilla.

Sorry to bog down your vacation with this.  If you want to talk today, I will 
be around.

Thanks,

have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan 
(ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe 
your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for

The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good

Subject: MEH Quarter Success

Hat's off to the group for a very successful quarter for MEH.  I graciously 
commend everyone for the teamwork and perseverance displayed in tackling the 
array of transactions and tasks to ensure the successful start of our new 
joint business.  We continue to have many challenges ahead, but I wanted to 
take pause and in particular commend the following:

Trunkline Transaction Team - Roy Rodriguez, Russell Murrell, and Steve Curlee 
brought to closure a significant transaction with leveraged off many groups 
in the PEC and Enron organizations.  Net transaction mark to market on behalf 
of MEH was $2,286,634  with accrual and option values to be realized over the 
3 year term of the arrangement.  Team work permeated this transaction and 
thanks are due to 1) legal teams for PEC led by Mary Klyasheff and for ENA 
led by Sheila Tweed and Jeff Hodge 2) structuring group support from Steve 
Curlee,  Deirdre McCaffrey and Ed McMichael 3) Tony Compton for the 
successful closure of gas supply transactions with third parties 4) to all 
else who covered the many transaction closing issues and bookings. 
NSS and NGPL Capacity Transaction Team - Steve Richman, Roy Rodriguez, 
Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard and Lee Fascetti successfully proposed, 
negotiated and are now managing a 3 year storage and capacity management of 
approximately 18 BCF/year of NGPL no-notice storage and accompanying 
transportation with realized value year to date for MEH of $1,510,459  with 
an additional $1,541,835  of value to PGL ratepayers.  This transaction will 
continue to be a significant asset to leverage into the intra-day market  and 
our initial platform for on-line business (EOL).
Daily Optimization - Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard, Steve Richman, Tim 
Hermann, Cary Carrabine and Lee Fascetti , diligently pursued and completed 
other significant transactions for MEH totalling $1,252,584 for this 
quarter.  Richard Tomaski and Kevin Radous have spent endless amounts of time 
(and evenings/weekends) to ensure that MEH had a P&L to represent for the 
groups hard work and my many thanks extend to both.
Business Set-up - Tim Hermann, Roy Rodriguez, Paul Burgener, Gregg Penman, 
Kevin Radous, Richard Tomaksi, and Barbara Dillard have toiled diligently and 
continue to proceed in contracts/policy and procedures between PEC/ENA/PGL 
and third parties. Additional thanks are due to all groups within accounting, 
economics, and trading within PEC and ENA in support of this new business and 
we ask for your continued engagement.

Over the next month, we must get closure on the remaining requirements of 
running a tightly managed and successful business venture.  We must continue 
to take our ideas and strategies to financially successful commercial 
operation .  Momentum is now on our side...

Thanx,

Laura

As we continue to define goals/objectives and coverage staffing in alignment 
with the corresponding trading group, I assumed that Eastern Canada 
origination would fall within the central region.  Specifically opportunities 
with Enbridge, Consumers and Union due to mid-market/trading coverage 
previously being at the central desk.  I understand there is history to this 
division and I have no desire to start any new issues or create larger 
organizational issues.   In the gas re-organization, how did you 
strategically divide Eastern Canada?

I would appreciate your direction or decision.

Subject: On-sight Power Generation Reclamation Business Plan





I recently read articles about Enron Corporation in Fortune magazine  and 
Business Week, and was encouraged by your success in building a  flexible and 
innovative workforce. I admire this type of approach from a leader  of a 
large, multi-national company. 

Based on Enron,s initiatives to market and sell wholesale electricity, and  
the recent power shortages across various regions of the country, I was  
motivated to develop a business opportunity utilizing my experience and  
knowledge of the on-site power generation market. I realized that an 
unregulated  utility company could take advantage of existing, unused 
stand-by generator  capacity.

My plan sells the excess capacity of these generators in the spot energy  
market, when the on-site generators are commanded to power customer base 
loads,  thereby freeing up an equivalent amount of energy. My plan requires 
minimal  capital investment, produces a sales volume of $2.0M, and a net 
profit of  $400,000.00 in year one. The attached business plan and three-year 
pro forma P  & L statement provide further details.

I strongly believe this idea can and will provide a solid return on  
investment. My goal is to heighten your interest enough to warrant further  
discussion on the possibility of Enron integrating this business plan into 
its  existing network of marketing, trading and selling electricity.

I chose to market this plan to Enron due to its leadership in the 
deregulated  electricity market, and its corporate culture of innovation and 
swift action.  Enron also has the name recognition, resources and national 
presence required to  make this plan successful.

I look forward to hearing from you on the merit of my business plan, and the  
feasibility of integrating it into your company.

Thank you for your time.

I really hate to bother you with this, but anything you can do to get these 
guys off the dime and moving (rather than complaining) would be appreciated. 
I called Westfahl as you suggested, but he never responded. At the end of the 
day, I think maybe the board approval we were talking about (Moore, Florida 
and Louisiana) is the only way to send the message. 

One highlight of interest in Coleman's e-mail is that it takes longer than 7 
months to construct a 6 - LM6000 plant. That's pretty amazing given that 
NEPCO just finished constructing four ENA plants (Gleason, Wheatland, Wilton 
and Doyle) in less than 6 months.

Anything you can do (or any advice) would be appreciated. Right now I'm 
simply ignoring the negativism and proceeding as quickly as possible.

cc: Bruce Golden/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 
Subject: Construction Duration, Florida Peaker Project

Ben,

Reflecting on our conversation at lunch the other day, I want to re-emphasize 
my concerns about the schedule issues.  You indicated that you had an idea 
that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 
months.  This is not at all realistic.  I would expect that the most 
aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired 
LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two 
weeks for each additional unit.  This would result in an installation 
duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.  In front 
of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work 
done.

The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling 
requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of 
this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental 
installation time per unit somewhat.  Considering these factors, it would not 
be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer.  

I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.  But I think 
that this is real world.  For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean 
getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. 

You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for 
Florida.  If this is correct then there is a serious disconnect for your 
schedule.  We need to make all efforts to expedite the on site date if June 
01 commercial operations is to be achieved.

Let's talk.

Mike

have Tom Briggs in the Enron Washington, DC office push?

B'fast Friday looks fine, it's on the calendar!  

Re: the coal strategy, you're exactly right.  There is however one major 
impediment.  While locating the plant near/at the source (i.e., mine-mouth) 
will ease transport costs for coal, there aren't many major coal mines 
located in the prime market zones for power.  The transmission (wires) grid 
was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk trading/transport the way gas does 
and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous (infinitely more so 
than building new plants).  For example, the average lead time to permit (not 
built, just permit) a high-voltage power line is 5-7 years!  As a result, a 
medium sized line (345kv, 200 miles) can cost upwards of $1-2 billion!  That 
was the most frustrating part of the 18 months I chased this stuff.  While 
the basic solutions appear to be so logical, the business (the utilities), 
regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking 
that breaking in was basically impossible.  Unless we're willing to put a 
billion $ at risk for 5-7 years on a merchant basis!  (NOT!)  Hell, you can't 
even get $100 million for your refinery deal!  Solving the power supply 
shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new 
technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas.  But until the FERC and 
state PUCs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more ""fungible"" 
and integrated transmission system, the utilities will continue to operate in 
their vacuum as these transmission barriers are the only things protecting 
their turfs.  Even though some have given the appearance of forming 
RTO's/ISO's (regional transmission organizations or independent system 
operators) this is simply a facade of utilities banding together to cover 
each other's asses.  The assets are still owned by the utilities themselves 
and the RTO/ISO has no authority to mandate expansion or anything requiring 
capital investment, other than routine maintenance, etc...  That's the whole 
genesis of what I was trying to preach to FERC, various utilities who 
""appeared"" to be more forward thinking about dereg, etc...  Basically, you'd 
be trading one evil (transport for fuel) for another (transport for 
electrons) and I'm afraid the latter is infinitely more complex (engineering 
wise) and costly.

See ya' Friday!

Doug -Mike Beyer worked on this idea last summer.  The problem we had was our 
need to focus on shorter term opportunities - and the bodies that would be 
required to do a good job.  I know that ENA is / was looking at some 
brownfield opportunities - but I haven't heard of any developments.

Subject: coal plants

George,

I'm sure I am way over simplifying this, but in light of current natural gas 
prices and the past success ENA had building six natural gas power plants 
wouldn't the same template work for building coal fired power plants in the 
US? I'm sure the choosing of potential sites and the overall permitting 
process is far more severe than the natural gas process, but it would seem 
Enron could and should be a leader in proposing new coal plants. Wouldn't it 
make sense to build a state of the art coal power plant closer to the actual 
coal supply, whereby we avoid the ever increasing transportation costs and 
then supply power by wire to surrounding states. States rich in coal reserves 
are always looking for more jobs which a new power plant would create and 
therefore may speed the permitting process along. Building the power 
transmission infrastructure across state lines may be cost prohibitive, but 
has this approach been analyzed by the coal group? 

Regards,
Doug

Dave,

Here is the list of folks involved in Cuiaba.

Laine Powell and his team - Project execution team for Cuiaba, located in 
Cuiaba
Jose Anson - Develpment -  Engineering/Permitting
Joan Carlos Albuquerque - FURNAS/Eletrobra relationship
Valeria Lima - ANP relationship
Daine Duarte - Local in Cuiaba.  Sounds like formally part of Lammers' team, 
but practically part of Laine's team
Jose Lucio dos Reis Neto - Agencies involved in electric system operation.  
Recovery oil fuel oil costs (complicated story/very important task)
Jose Bestard - Project continuity.  Original PPA negotiations
John Novak - Lawyer...key to financing
Rob Gay - Financing lead...key to financing
Rick Lammers - Commercial project lead

I sent this on top of Pete Weidler's e-mail and summarized a good part of it 
above.  Only Lammers and Gay were not mentioned in Pete's e-mail.

Another thought...pull people in from EE&CC as part of the ""new team"".  No 
basis in fact here, but I suspect there are too many contractor/owner games 
going on.  Probably need the EE&CC key people list as well.  Do you want me 
to shake it loose, do you want to work it with Leff, or bad idea?

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,

KIsh

Joe - this is the list I asked Laine to put together. - I asked him not to 
list all the folks under Laine - as I assume they stay with the project no 
matter where it goes.


Jose Anson - he is the coordinator of permitting at IBAMA and ANP for the 
pipeline.  He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of 
his efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person.

Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he 
is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know 
folks but he also gets things done within the system.

Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.

Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the 
year after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times 
about her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to 
relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that 
are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.

Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He 
has been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the 
project successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project 
from the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view.

Two other people that are not involved in ""our side"" of fence on a daily 
basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.  Jose knows the 
history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.

But you (or does anyone) have a definitive team list for Cuiaba?  Need this 
for transition planning purposes.  I agree with your sentiment that some 
folks may be pulling double duty while we button up Cuiaba.   Just need to 
know ""how many"" and ""who"".

Subject: Cuiaba Review

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Pete

Karen - let me know if it would be beneficial to brief Rick or Jeff.  I'll 
stop whatever I'm doing if necessary.  I think on this particular turbine 
purchase...... there is great interest from ENA, Calme, and EECC third pty.  
I agree that in general - we can't take our eye off the ball with respect to 
the long turbines.  F.Kelly

Subject: Monthly Mid Market Coverage Report

Dave:

I want to be sure I am on the right track for providing you ,John and Kevin 
with meaningful account coverage data. I envision a one page 
summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage 
ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set 
at 100%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards 
would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially 
active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at 
least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose 
product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each 
commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.  I will 
derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates 
and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master 
list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list 
quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed 
coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?

In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business 
plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will be
identification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy 
Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I 
don't want to provide you with something ""half-baked"".  Is it acceptable to 
allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provide
you with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ? 

Finally, I have provided Tammy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed 
transactions plus a deal flow ""hot list"" .

Sorry for being verbose. Please advise. 

Thanks,     Ed

memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.


As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

I do think DealBench was extremely valuable - and I'll say we - ENA - but 
what I really mean is you could not have gotten there nearly as quickly 
without it.  I think you agree.  By the same token, if they said 'free' up 
front, we don't have to pay.  I think this is really a negotiation between 
Dave and Greg if we want to move income to DealBench.

Don

Congrats on your deals. JinSung had apprised me that things went well and in 
San Antonio I ran into Dave Delainey and he was very happy with the whole 
thing.

With the current NetWorks structure, and considering the benefits you have 
derived, we want to charge you a nominal amount for each of these data 
rooms.  We want to bill you 25k for each data room for a total of 175k.

I know that at the beginning of the deal you had asked me this question and 
my answer was 'we aint charging you' but the business model for us has 
changed and we need to show revenues and income to external customers and 
external partners we are trying to get to.  Hence we want to bill internal 
customers whatever is the reasonable price of the service offered.

I will call you later to discuss ( I did mention to Dave in San Antonio I was 
going to have to do this, considering my business situation)



Harry

Dear David,

My name is David Ronkainen and I have been an Enron employee for about one 
year.  I joined 
Enron as a result of my interest in fuel cells as a business opportunity for 
me.  I met with Dave Ramm 
to discuss that opportunity and he asked me if I would be interested in 
working for Enron.  
I recently read a press release that ENA had entered into an alliance with 
Fuel Cell Energy, Inc.  I still 
have a strong interest in fuel cells and the belief that they will be the 
most commonly used power 
supply of the not so distant future.  I went to a seminar on distributed 
power in Washington D.C. last 
week to talk with the technologists and hear what the investment community  
thought about fuel cells 
and microturbines.  I learned a lot.

Right now I am working for Enron Corp. Environmental, Health and Safety.  My 
job is interesting, but I have 
a stronger interest in fuel cells and the power technology that will serve 
DP.  Do you have a job opportunity
for a technologist in your business that is involved with fuel cells and 
microturbines?  If there is an opportunity
I would like to talk with you about it.

I graduated from Michigan Technological University with a B.S. in Mechanical 
Engineering.  I have worked 
in manufacturing and the oil field service business.  I have worked at the 
corporate level in both businesses.
I know what it takes to efficiently manufacture a product and how a business 
should be run.  I also understand the 
opportunities and liabilities that environmental protection poses to new 
industries and technologies.  I  know
that I can help Enron in this area.

If you would like my resume please let me know.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

David Ronkainen

Dave --

Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I 
wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed 
via a few initiatives, including:

1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the 
direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year)
2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up
3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend
4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have 
been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting)

There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but 
this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy 
to sit down and discuss this with you.

Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a 
meeting, we need to pick a date and get on the Hyatt calendar soon.  Their 
calendar is filling up quickly.  Thanks.

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    ""Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder"" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. ""This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice."" Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    ""We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,""
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. ""We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance.""
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.

"Memo on Vitro Project","Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I 
expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday 
is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of 
service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost 
and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other 
business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy. 

I make money you make money.

Thanks for your cooperation.

"Retention and motivation initiatives for top ENA A&A's","David, I wouldn't do the Brown Bag (too often- too hard to keep doing); I 
wouldn't do the Social Gathering (too country clubish); I like the Monthly 
Dinner/Cocktail Hour/Ballgame, etc with the OTC and parts of the management  
team as a forum to identify talent, give A&A's exposure to the management 
team and to ""sell"" ENA. I would suggest that we make it every two months 
rather than monthly. However, I would have the first one very quickly for the 
top rated A&A in ENA that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch 
them on staying in ENA - maybe dinner and ballgame. 

For the resource management and coaching part of the program, lets wait until 
we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first.  I 
assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives. 
Once we have a few ideas, I would like to pitch Whalley, Sherriff and Mark 
when I get back.

Lets go ahead and implement above ASAP.

this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Guys, please mark your calendars for the 2000 ENA Management Offsite 
scheduled for December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  We 
envision people flying in the afternoon/evening of December 13th with the 
offsite being held on December 14th and 15th.  Departure would occur the 
morning of December 16th.  It is important that everyone stays for the entire 
period including Friday night.  Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley have taken 
time out their schedule to speak to us on Thursday and Friday night about 
Enron Corps strategy and our eCommerce/Networks strategy respectively.

A complete agenda will follow shortly.

Dorie Hitchcock will manage all the logistics.

"Flight to Vegas","Dave has reserved a Plane to take all of you to Las Vegas for the Offsite, 
December 13th.  We have no idea  what time the PRC will be over; however, at 
the conclusion of the PRC everyone should plan to go straight to the Hanger 
to board the aircraft.  

I just got confirmation last night that I have the plane, so I really don't 
have any details at this point.  As soon as I get the information, I will 
make packets for each of you with directions to the hanger.

We are asking that you make your own reservations for the return since 
everyone will be leaving at different times.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Thanks,

"2001 Allocations","Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, 
assuming a fixed amount of the ""internal"" legal costs are fairly represented 
by this allocation as ENA's ""capacity"" charge, you are correct.  This number 
will be in the P/L under your name.  The ""outside"" legal costs should be 
tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I 
need an estimate of the quarterly ""capacity charge"" for ENA and an estimate 
of outside legal costs by business unit.

Dave:

I have attached the ""time allocations"" (which are used for inside costs only) 
by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of 
total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate 
the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had 
used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we 
will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement?

Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 
2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our 
approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the 
nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and 
the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will 
be managed.

Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.

Subject: Ontario NUG Contract Management

Dave/John, we have been awarded the RFP to assume the role of contract 
manager for the Ontario NUG's (some 1700 MW's) for a 3 year term. A 
definitive agmt will  be executed by the end of November. This was a 
high-profile RFP and I think that it confirms our investment in positioning 
ourselves in Ontario.

This was truly a team effort (east/west orig, east trading, legal, 
regulatory) in responding to the RFP with a ton of long days needed in a 
short time-frame. The response to RFP was structured to manage all risks and 
well thought out which ultimately led to our successful bid.

I attach an executive summary that gives further details. If you have any 
questions, please call myself, Paul or Eric.

"Freeman and CDWR","Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day 
deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John 
about this?  I am supportive of this proposal and approach.  Like our 
discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of 
this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.  We also 
have to support Lay's efforts in California.

Subject: Freeman and CDWR

Dave,

I just spoke with Freeman to let him know that we can provide him a letter 
proposal which I can send out Monday.  In general, we will offer 50MW NP-15 
Peak from February 22 - March 31 at a fixed price (currently $265) with 
payment due every 7 days.  This would be documented under the form of EEI 
that they have agreed to and is subject to (i) payment of outstanding amounts 
due Enron; (ii) execution of EEI and confirm; (iii) confirmation that they 
will pay the amounts due; (iv) good faith obligation to put together 
creidtworthy structure; (v) good faith look at term deal which can be 
back-dated to blend with this current deal, Pastoria and Demand Management.  

It took some time to nail down the settlement numbers on our side.  Legal 
spent some time with Freeman's attorney but got agreement on the EEI Form.  
Credit likes this a lot.    Tim will have Lavo wear the market exposure - 
$2MM if the market falls $100.  David Freeman said he would look at it Monday 
but it sounded good.  

I will pull it together and copy you over the weekend.

Chris

Subject: Calme EE Transition List

David:

As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme 
employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel.

We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people.

Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list.

The enclosed list indicates the current proposed ""New Roles"" for each of the 
Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees 
among:  

Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to 
complete)
Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals
LNG/Middle East to go to EGM
Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses)
EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain 
technical/operations people)

The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to 
ensure that no individual falls through the cracks.

The column ""Calme"" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and 
you may wish to ignore it.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Shawn

"2001 Group Expenses","Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.

"Bammel Storage Cushion Gas Issue.","Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame 
or ""cover our backsides"";  however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine 
breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the 
desk.  As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white 
issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executives 
of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to 
ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.  
Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this 
divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into 
the overall framework of ENA.

I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading 
floor.

I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas 
business.

Subject: Bammel Storage Cushion Gas Issue.

I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the 
HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated 
to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas 
that would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to set 
the record straight in the spirit of ""Facts Are Friendly"".  

First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six - 
eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of 
Wes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year 
end to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not a 
problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just 
the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:  
1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.  
2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31, 
2000. 
 1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF 
was made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based on
         the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several 
years proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice, 
the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period the 
Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the 
physical           capabilities of the facility.  
 2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with 
anything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included 
the         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.  
This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.  
In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left 
in the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it 
could be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.
It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up 
irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I was 
dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level 
involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.  

From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if 
I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the 
cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated 
to and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with other 
issues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring 
around to cover their backside.

Subject: DQE -- Impact of Operating at Reduced Capacity: PRIVILEGED AND 
CONFIDENTIAL

Our memorandum of today's date on the DQE facilities estimates a 65% to 70% 
likelihood of the facilities qualifying for section 29 tax credits, based on 
projected volumes of 225 tons per hour.

As we discussed a week ago, if we operate the facilities at a volume of 118 
per hour, (i.e., half-capacity), we believe we would alleviate the tax risk 
associated with the increase in capacity.  The question is, does that 
improvement in the odds with respect to that one issue improve the 
bottom-line odds on qualification at least with respect to the base volume of 
118 per hour from the 65% to 70% estimate that we specified in our memorandum?

We think it does, but we are not sure that there will be a material 
improvement.  We have passed that question on to our outside tax counsel, and 
will let you know his view.  

As we noted last week, there are several legal issues for which, while we 
think we have the better argument, there is no definitive legal precedent.  
Even pulling the capacity issue out of the equation --which is what we would 
be doing if we are only considering the 118 tons -- there are still several 
other balls in the air, and we would have to catch each and every one in 
order to have a tax-creditworthy facility.  When you look at each issue, 
separately, it seems possible to get comfortable as to each one, but when you 
consider that there are several such issues, and that we have to be ""right"" 
each and every time, you have to lower your overall odds.  Statistically 
speaking, if you are 80% comfortable as to each of 5 separate issues, then 
you would expect to hit on 4 out of 5, not on 5 out of 5, but we can't lose 
on any one issue and still qualify for credits. 

Obtaining a private letter ruling from the IRS as to these issues, which is 
our ultimate goal, would take these issues out of the air, so to speak, but 
that's not going to happen pre-close, and no matter what assurances we might 
get at a pre-ruling conference with the IRS, unless and until you actually 
get the ruling, there is an element of risk that you have to assume.  For 
that reason, the 90% probability number that I threw out at last week's 
meeting in response to a question about what our comfort level would be if we 
had a private letter ruling is really a red herring, because at decision 
time, there's not going to be a ruling in hand.  

As noted above, I will let you know what Bruce Lemons' view is, since he is 
the one who will be called upon to give an opinion. Hopefully, that will be 
later today.

Dave,

To the extent you feel it is truly in ENA's best interest, Ed and I are 
prepared to honor your wishes with respect to Tom Swank joining the 
mid-market group.   However, it should be noted that we (as a group) have 
significant reservations about Tom disrupting the chemistry in our group.  
The input from all of my my key guys (including Rogers who worked with Swank 
at Dynegy for a number of years) was negative regarding Tom as a member of 
our team.

We are concerned about his longevity in the group and his work ethic in 
general.  Again, I am prepared to respect your decision (particularly since 
you control my paycheck) and give Tom the benefit of the doubt, but I wanted 
to express my reservations.

Please let me know your thoughts

Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON
To: ENA and EGM Employees, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Europe
cc: Executive Committee and Assistants 
Subject: Organization Announcement


We are pleased to announce the following organization changes within Enron 
Global Markets (EGM).

Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to lead our new 
finance activities.  In this role, he will work with all commodity products, 
assets, and teams worldwide to lever our existing businesses with this new 
focus.  Larry has worked as treasurer and was responsible for 3rd party 
financing for EBS for the last year.  He has worked for Enron for 4 1/2 years 
in various positions in the finance area.  He will be reporting to the Office 
of the Chairman.

Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and will co-head this effort with 
Rick Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the 
worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity and focus 
on the Atlantic regions of the world.  He will also manage the LNG shipping 
book.  Eric is located in the London office and also has responsibility for 
leading the newly formed Pool Markets origination group reporting to Joe 
Gold.    

Rick Bergsieker has relocated to Dubai, in the UAE.  He is responsible for 
all Middle East activities and projects, managing the Puerto Rico assets and 
will co-head the worldwide LNG efforts.  Rick has over 20 years of LNG 
experience and together, he and Eric will form an outstanding leadership team 
as we expand Enron,s LNG activities around the world.  They both will report 
to the Office of the Chairman.  

Jennifer Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for 
all products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fundamentals and 
Intranet pages existing today.  Previously, Jennifer was working in the Mid 
Market origination group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group 
developing the commercial interface for our Intranet page.  Heather was with 
Azurix, where she worked on the platform interface for their eBusiness 
initiatives. 

Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Traders, Roundtable.  This new group will 
be comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management 
businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics 
important to their individual markets, and to learn and explore other markets 
in a macro sense.  Also, we will be forming a cross-commodity trading group.  
Traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will 
have the opportunity to join this group and to exploit cross-commodity 
opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group 
will not be involved in customer activity and will execute through our 
principal desks.   Gary will manage this new group, as well as continuing 
with his current F/X, Rates, Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. 

Please join us in congratulating everyone on their new positions.  
Organization charts outlining the entire EGM organization are available upon 
request from Cathy Phillips.

To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT
cc:  
Subject: Re:  

Dave,

Short answer is ""no"".

Long answer:

Has had bad chemistry with some of the folks down there.  Maybe not all his 
fault...I do not have enough data.

He wants to push Brazil as important Wholesale market (ie pulp & paper, ags, 
metals).  I think this is sound and worth looking at.  But I think this 
should be looked at by those groups.  They set their priorities.  If they 
want to pay for him being down there, we can house him and coordinate etc.  
But I am going back to basics with energy and can not afford someone pushing 
something for the good of Enron on my P/L.  Probably narrow minded, but 
hopefully pragmatic on my part.

I used him last to interface with Networks.  He is pretty fast out of the 
chute (market analysis, who's who in country etc.), but then levels off 
before tangible bottom line contribution (during my observation period 
anyway.)

Probably more of a ""think tank"" guy and the ""think tank"" ain't in Brazil. 
(especially post reorg)

So is he worth keeping for Enron?  I say yes, in the right role.  (worked for 
Cargill previously with Risk Management experience)  Does he fit with Enron 
Americas in South America?  I say no and have told him as much.

Call if you need more.

Thanks,

Kish

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a ""Bundle Products"" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

Joe - this is the list I asked Laine to put together. - I asked him not to 
list all the folks under Laine - as I assume they stay with the project no 
matter where it goes.


Jose Anson - he is the coordinator of permitting at IBAMA and ANP for the 
pipeline.  He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of 
his efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person.

Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he 
is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know 
folks but he also gets things done within the system.

Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.

Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the 
year after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times 
about her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to 
relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that 
are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.

Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He 
has been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the 
project successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project 
from the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view.

Two other people that are not involved in ""our side"" of fence on a daily 
basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.  Jose knows the 
history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Pete

Subject: Enron Europe Support

We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
appropriate for our activities.

The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
states of development and application of business strategies.

The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
experience and corresponding strategy.

I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
business.

"Basic","David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH.  
Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the 
reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant 
recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and 
infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?  

The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy 
prices.

Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?

Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want 
to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring.

Subject: SDG&E Complaint vs. Sellers into Calif ISO / Calif PX

SDG&E filed a Complaint with the FERC that requests an ""emergency order 
capping at $250 per MWh the prices"" for all parties selling into the Calif 
ISO and the Calif PX.   SDG&E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are 
""fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable 
competition"".

EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved 
EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market 
power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh 
into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.

Government Affairs is responding in two ways --

1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
market-based rate authority.

2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.

The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
August.

This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
discuss this with you.

Call with questions.  

Thanks,

Jim

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

Folks, you are the remaining officers of ENA that have not yet enrolled in 
this mandated training program.  It is ENA's goal to have all its officers 
through the program before the end of calendar year 2000.  The course has 
received very high marks for effectiveness.  Please take time now to enroll 
in the program. Speak to your HR representative if you need help getting 
signed up.

"Mariner","Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with 
Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the 
aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months 
ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are 
expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention 
significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the 
$600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve 
growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to 
demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and 
reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a 
significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The 
concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a 
very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable 
strategy to maximize the exit value).

I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points:
 a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and
 b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.

Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to 
sell tha asset.

I hope this meets with your approval.

Delainey

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks

Subject: PRC

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

Subject: Re: Indian Mesa  

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and 
agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal 
we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way 
forward.  Adam

Subject: Indian Mesa

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Regards

Dave,

It would be really great for you to do that.  Unfortunately we start at 
10.30am UK / 4.30am US time (the only slot we could get for the Auditorium).  
It won't be as cool as a video link up, but if you give me a text message 
addressed to all European staff, I'll read it out.

I'll get the senior guys together on Monday for the weekly EES 2.30pm UK / 
8.30am US video conference call so you and Janet can at least speak to them.

Let's get you and Janet over to Europe to meet and greet the troops in person 
later in the year when you guys realise what you have taken on!

Matthew

Matthew, would your Monday meeting be a good time (if the time change works) 
for me to introduce myself and say a few words via video conference or the

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Matthew

Soaring natgas prices revive interest in coal
December 07, 2000 3:31:00 PM ET
By Andrew Kelly 

HOUSTON, Dec 07 (Reuters) - Soaring prices for natural gas and concerns about 
future supplies are prompting U.S. electricity generators to take another 
look at coal which had fallen out of favor as gas dominated the nation's 
plans for new power plants. 

Wisconsin Electric started the ball rolling in September with plans to build 
two new 600 megawatt coal-fired power plants, the first to be announced in 
the United States in several years. 

Richard Grigg, president of the Wisconsin Energy Corp.(WEC) unit, said the 
decision was a simple matter of prudence and a way to avoid putting all of 
your eggs in one basket. 

""We believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part 
of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply,"" Grigg told Reuters in 
an interview. 

Although coal accounts for just over half of U.S. electricity production, the 
economic and environmental advantages of modern gas turbines had made the 
decision about how to fuel new power plants something of a no-brainer in 
recent years. 

Consequently, over 90 percent of new plants currently planned in the United 
States are slated to burn natural gas. 

But as natural gas prices soar, hitting all-time highs of over $9 per million 
British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, Grigg 
suspects that other power producers will also take another look at coal. 

""Given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability, I think 
you're going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal,"" Grigg said. 

BACK IN THE PICTURE 

Griff Jones, vice-president of power trading at Dynegy Inc. (DYN), said high 
natural gas prices and recent advances in clean combustion technology had put 
coal back in the picture. 

""A year or two ago people wouldn't bring up the subject of developing a coal 
plant. Today there's talk about it,"" he said. 

For Dynegy, which began as a natural gas marketer and has made the 
convergence of the natural gas and electric power businesses an article of 
faith, that is quite an admission. 

Since the oil price explosions of the 1970s, the share of oil used in U.S. 
power generation has dwindled to around 3 percent. 

Nuclear plants deliver about 20 percent of the nation's electricity but 
construction of new nuclear plants is widely viewed as politically impossible 
following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 
1986. 

Natural gas currently supplies about 15 percent of U.S. electricity but is 
projected to gain market share steadily due to power generators' enthusiasm 
for the high efficiency and low emissions of the latest ""combined-cycle"" gas 
turbines. 

Oil and gas industry executives often cite projected growth in U.S. demand 
for natural gas of 30 trillion cubic feet by 2010, much of it fueled by 
increased use of gas for power generation. 

Plans for new gas-fired power plants are based on the assumption that the 
industry will be able to step up to the plate and deliver ever-increasing 
amounts of gas. 

FLAT GAS PRODUCTION 

In recent years, however, U.S. natural gas production has remained stubbornly 
steady around 19 billion cubic feet, augmented by Canadian imports of around 
3 billion cubic feet. 

The recent surge in gas prices has pushed the number of drilling rigs 
currently searching for gas in the United States to unprecedented levels of 
over 800 from just over 600 a year ago. 

But so far, at least, production remains more or less flat as gas producers 
fight the accelerating depletion of mature fields. 

Plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in Alaska 
will alleviate the supply situation, but the gas would only start flowing in 
the second half of this decade. 

Coal, on the other hand, is abundant and readily available: the United States 
has reserves equivalent to well over 200 years of domestic consumption. 

Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, estimated in a recent report 
that the United States will need 300,000-400,000 megawatts of new electricity 
generating capacity over the next decade, or somewhere between 800 and 1,000 
new plants. 

Natural gas producers would be hard pressed to supply enough fuel for even 
half of that new capacity, he calculated. 

""Therefore, we think it likely that new coal-fired generating capacity will 
also be necessary to meet demand growth,"" Niles wrote. ""We see no alternative 
fuel capable of producing the necessary power, due to political and time 
constraints."" 

Wisconsin Electric's Grigg said it might not be long before other power 
generators followed his own company's lead and drew up plans for new 
coal-fired plants. 

""I have heard some rumblings from others that are also recognizing that 
economics as well as supply issues are starting to look more favorable for 
coal,"" he said.

Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the 
insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern 
(especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally 
and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market 
perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding 
multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys 
could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a 
well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John 
at the offsite):
 a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer 
list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination 
if this is a commercially viable product;
 b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure 
a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and 
come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had 
promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote 
this capability to these customers ASAP;
 c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP;
 d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need 
to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.

This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.

We are heading down the road of a gate keeper approach which has proven very 
inefficient at Enron in the past.    Our group has already canceled a meeting 
with the CFO of Vintage because of this approach.  Rerarding  industry 
relationships, George Carrick, Mark Tawney and I have extensive relationships 
throughout the upstream sector, know the decision makers and can set up our 
own meetings, all in coordination with the upstream group.  At this time I am 
waiting on John's group to set up our meetings.  Seems very inefficient.

The main objective is to determine if there is demand for the product.  I 
will continue to coordinate through John but we need to meet to clarify roles 
and responsibilities of all parties - how will deals be structured, who will 
price, who will negotiate transaction, etc.

Dave,

a)  I do not believe Skilling is aware of the latest updates on our efforts 
to syndicate some of the Canadian exposures.  To my knowledge, the last time 
it was brought to his attention was March 1999 (Blue Range default).  We do 
report our top exposures to him and the Board which includes CNR, 
Petro-Canada, and Talisman on a quarterly basis.  Rob and team are actively 
working with my team to mitigate exposures through other measures.
b) I will be happy to provide insight as needed.  The riskiest commercial 
objections are from Lagrasta's group.
c) We have received margin from Sempra and Duke.  We have a valuation dispute 
with Statoil and are actively working through the details.

Let me know if you need further information.
Bill

Subject: Excess Credit Exposure

Guys, I went throught the Credit Margin Exception Report for 4/24/00.  This 
shows our excess credit exposure at approximately $ 391M (after guarantees).  
I have a couple of questions:

 a) Canada (>$200M) - Rick/Bill/Rob - Is the board and Skilling aware of the 
credit positions and OK?   I know Rob has been working on    mitigation plans;
 b) Commercial Objections: (>$67M)
  - Paper - Edward ($27M) - The report shows a number of commerical 
objections to calling for collateral ie) Repap,  Times Mirror and Waste   
Mgt. Can you give me a call to discuss - we may need documentation to support;
  - Gas/Mid-Mkt - Jeff ($29M)- Do you own Cross Timbers Oil Co, Torch Energy, 
Aurora Natural Gas, Seneca Resource Corp and Cody Energy?   We have in these 
cases additional commercial objections to calling for collateral - lets 
discuss;
  - Mariner  ($9M)- Ray we are showing a collateral need of approx. $9.0M - 
given our equity position this may be moot;however, lets discuss.
 c) Margin Call (>$51M) - Rick/Bill - have we been successful in getting the 
margin posted by Sempra, Statoil and Duke?

Canada is a tricky issue; however, we should be able to work down the 
commercial objections and collect on the margin calls to get the number down.

Delainey

Subject: Planning for Technical Support Requirements

Dave and Dave,

Wayne Mays and I are trying to assess technical support requirements for the 
next 12-24 months.  We would like to talk with each of you to get you input 
on the direction the company is going, and what type and level of support is 
likely to be required as we go forward.

If possible, we'd like to schedule a brief (30 minute) conference call, 
preferably within the next week, with each of you to discuss these issues.  
If you have a time that would be convenient, please let me and/or Wayne know 
so that we can get it scheduled.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman

"East Power Mid-Market Org. Chart","Ed, this looks great!!!! 

 Please ensure that the focus is on coverage, deal flow and building markets. 
 I want to avoid two groups hunting strategic elephants (ie) east origination 
and development so ensure the scope is consistent with mid-market coverage 
and feeding the desk deals and info.   In the case of building or purchasing 
assets please let Jacoby's group handle.  Any deal or lead that significantly 
disrupts coverage or takes you or your people out of the market please pass 
or coordinate with origination or development

There is bound to be some conflict between the strategic origination groups 
and you - please keep to a minimum and resolve in a manner consistent with 
one team and doing the right thing.

Please provide John and I a monthly report of customer transactions 
completed, coverage plans and ""market building iniatives"".  

Let me know how I can assist in any way in recruiting or transactions.

Dave,

I wanted to let you know that I really appreciate you taking the time out of 
your very busy shedule to meet with me.  It means a lot to me that you showed 
the level of interest that you did.  I went over the attached documents with 
Jeff and Fred last Wednesday and thought that I should send you a copy to 
update you on where the industrial middle marketing group stands at mid-year. 
I am wrapping up the business plan and strategy that you asked me to 
prepare.  I would still like to meet with you (as well as whomever else you 
decide) at your convenience to review.  I will check with Kay on your 
availability.

including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican 
business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development 
risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.

Subject: Super Saturday, June 3, 2000

During our off-site at Columbia Lakes recently,  we identified areas in ENA 
where significant gaps exist that need filling at the Analyst and Associate 
level.  We have scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday on June 3, 2000 and I 
would like your participation as an interviewer.  We will need approximately  
25-30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 Associate & Analyst positions.  I 
am counting on everyone making themselves available on the third to 
facilitate this priority action item.

Ted Bland will be forwarding information concerning the event to each of you 
early next week.  

Thank you for your participation.  

Dave

"Cangen","Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which 
does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this 
is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in 
seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation 
company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 
2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via 
the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current 
SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency 
power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.  
The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets 
that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and 
constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  

The benefits include:
 a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the 
opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the 
possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, 
Capstone and Elektryon;
 b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe 
that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize 
this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer 
applications;
 c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of 
critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this 
venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in 
our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;
 d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital 
would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology 
did not work or the market did not materialize;
 e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;
 and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.

However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other 
Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company 
and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the 
technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful 
application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.

Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a 
very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of 
the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently 
operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering 
expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause 
at a fixed number for their 50% .

If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I 
will set up a meeting.

Delainey

George,

Thanks for the note and the message. I will try to call you later today, but
will send this note just in case I miss you.

While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW,
there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys at
Enron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 1600 MW plant in Texas -
permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close to
securing the rights to a 800 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like to
talk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.

Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existing
generating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I saw
a report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in the
statement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the development
sites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tie
back to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.

Hope you are enjoying London,

Cheers,

Chuck

"Re: Itinerary","Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just 
play it by ear.

At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following 
discussions/agenda:
 a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, 
participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and 
political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & 
historical prices and volumes;
 b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation 
strategy;
 c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product 
development;
 and d) brief review of other S. American markets.

I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and 
any one else you think appropriate.

Let me know what I need to do otherwise.

Subject: Goldendale


Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate 
out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood 
from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't 
yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We 
are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition 
to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. 
Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to 
execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the 
que position) by then. 

I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with 
earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you 
app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC 
contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has 
significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and 
anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.

Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two 
projects. Thanks Dick.

Subject: Organizational Changes

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication, 
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide 
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that 
are underway to restructure  Enron,s operations in South America.  The basic 
organizational framework has been set. 

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and 
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting 
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility; 
however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination, 
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe,s focus will 
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall 
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO 
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding 
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in 
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark 
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and 
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our 
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being 
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets 
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South 
America will be organized around the highly successful North American network 
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical 
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value 
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and 
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to 
Joe and Orlando:
 
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will  
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine 
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services 
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital 
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the 
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value 
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move 
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the 
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America 
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal 
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who 
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity, 
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution, 
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals. 

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The 
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book 
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales 
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively 
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible 
for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct 
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas 
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American 
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we 
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.  

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization 
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support 
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team 
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in 
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business 
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as 
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston 
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements 
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will 
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as 
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate, 
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a 
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will 
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this 
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory 
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick 
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the 
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his 
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will 
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be 
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the 
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and 
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal 
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron 
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information 
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will 
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial 
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting 
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron 
Wholesale Services ) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale 
Services ) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and 
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our 
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new 
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the 
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly 
affected will be notified shortly.
 
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its 
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are 
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create 
shareholder value.

"Re: EPMI WEST - Recent Trades with Long term Duration","Chris, this sounds good.  It would be helpful for us (the overall power 
business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the 
effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all 
believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and 
rewarded.

Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) 
customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions

I spoke with Ed Baughman about the reports he is generating to measure Middle 
Market Group ""coverage"" in the East.  I also met with Greg Wolfe. and Tim B. 
to get their feedback as to how the East Desk Middle Market Reports reports 
should be used/modified for the West.  As a result of these discussions, 
along with discussions with others in the Middle Market Group, effective 
October 1, we will begin to more systematically measure certain behaviors, 
such as customer telephone calls, in addition to origination.  By focusing on 
behaviors, and not simply results, our hope is to expand the pool of 
customers and information and improve our marketing effort.  I will be 
working with Ed to try to standarize the approach within EPMI.

It is my understanding that you will be in Portland for a QBR toward the end 
of October.  I look forward to reviewing our plans for coverage metrics and 
our first results with you then.  

Let me know if you want to discuss this approach prior to your visit.

Subject: EPMI WEST - Recent Trades with Long term Duration

Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Subject: EPMI WEST - Recent Trades with Long term Duration

Dave/John:

As you know, EPMI West recently has closed numerous longer-dated transactions 
(through 2002 and beyond) with munis and other direct counterparties (not 
marketers).  Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the 
Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, 
each with a different role, working out the split of origination to 
everyone's satisfaction. Tim Belden (see below) thought you might be 
interested in the attached spreadsheet listing some of these key deals done 
this year.  

Please let me know if you want further details on the transactions 
(503/464-3822).

Thanks!

Chris

Subject: Long Term Deals

Could you please send an e-mail to Delainey, Lavorato, and Calger summarizing 
our long term deals done this year.  It should be pretty short with just the 
facts.  The deals I can think of are Kaiser, Roseville, Santa Clara, Redding, 
and Merced.  They didn't ask for it, but I think it would be nice to do a 
quick, short, sweet piece of Portland Orig/Middle Market PR.  Let me know 
your thoughts.

Thanks.  Tracey

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in 
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of the 
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power 
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 due 
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth 
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that 
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a 
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The 
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employee 
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation 
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal 
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to 
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate 
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase 
our &mid-market8 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading and 
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better 
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent 
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that are 
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business models 
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are 
being implemented:
a) East Power ) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-market 
and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and 
Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairman 
(EA OOC).  This team will have one income statement, one book and a joint 
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside these 
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage 
the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the 
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to generate 
origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation, 
provide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team will 
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting 
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the 
Eastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU,s, 
muni,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP,s and will utilize all ENA,s product 
capabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital. The team will 
further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business units 
including: 
  (i) ERCOT ) managed by Doug Gilbert Smith and Bruce Sukaly;
  (ii) NE ) managed by Dana Davis and Jeff Ader;
  (iii) Midwest ) managed by Fletch Sturm and Ed Baughman;
  (iv) SE ) managed by Rogers Herndon and Ozzie Pagan;
  (v) East Power Development ) managed by Ben Jacoby;
  (vi) East Power Structuring  - managed by Bernie Aucoin; and
  (vii) East Power Fundamentals and the &Genco8 ) managed by Lloyd Will
   
b) West Power ) there will be no changes to the Portland office which is 
managed by Tim Belden and Chris Calger .  Both Tim and Chris will continue to 
report to the EA OOC.
c) Canada and Mexico ) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexican 
offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively.  
Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.
d) U.S. Natural Gas ) there are several changes anticipated in this business 
consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes 
primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region 
will consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and 
origination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint 
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside these 
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage 
the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the 
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to generate 
origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation, 
provide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team will 
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting 
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the 
Eastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be 
responsible for covering the LDC,s, muni,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU,s, IPP,s 
and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side of 
the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in 
addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA,s 
product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each of 
these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas ) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and 
origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank 
Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team.  
West Gas  ) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-managed by 
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from the 
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under 
this team.
Central Gas )  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed 
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be 
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas ) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team will 
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sale 
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Texas 
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets.  
Financial ) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with no 
significant changes.
Derivatives ) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative and 
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market 
specifically targeting CFO,s and treasury departments.  Fred will continue to 
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and 
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise, 
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas 
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products ) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several 
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  This 
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions. 
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and 
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include 
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor 
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor 
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital 
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with 
Texaco.  
Gas Structuring ) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to Frank 
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals ) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting to 
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.    

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identified 
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas 
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
 
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power 
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP,s.  The teams will 
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or 
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP,s, to the extent that the product offering 
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have 
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two 
organizations in Houston. 

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize our 
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to 
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized 
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage the 
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA,s technical risks and 
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA 
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In 
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will 
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portion 
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This 
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and 
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage risk 
and monetize. 

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale and 
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and 
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian will 
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  )  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new 
opportunities in EBS, ENA,s venture capital function will be managed by 
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed 
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from 
Enron,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the EA 
OOC.

g) Corporate Development ) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate 
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role and 
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments ) there will be no changes to this group managed by 
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources ) there will be no changes to this group 
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will 
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas will 
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America.  
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating 
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al.  
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue to 
conduct business in that company. 

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy 
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the 
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and 
your family a very happy and safe holiday season.

Subject: EPMI protests AEP's continuation of MBRs

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request 
to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes 
examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that 
potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. 

EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier 
this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR 
filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.

"CDWR Response","FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.  I believe that 
discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his 
staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.  In 
the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in 
their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for 
the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their 
advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a 
transaction.

 The proposal includes:
  a) traded power products of various sizes and terms;
  b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) 
for term;
  c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide 
gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts;
  and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.

I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.

"Re: Itinerary","David, thanks for the people listing.

Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each 
market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads 
and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 
budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES 
business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current 
balance sheet would be helpful as well.

I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.

You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help.

Subject: Re: Itinerary

Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just 
play it by ear.

At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following 
discussions/agenda:
 a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, 
participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and 
political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & 
historical prices and volumes;
 b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation 
strategy;
 c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product 
development;
 and d) brief review of other S. American markets.

I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and 
any one else you think appropriate.

Let me know what I need to do otherwise.

Thanks

I would suggest day one in Sao Paulo and day two and three in Rio.  I would 
also suggest the Cesar Park in Rio, better location, although Copacabana 
Palace is more famous and classy hotel.  Trip from Rio to Sao Paulo is like 
from Houston to Dallas, inconsequential, spend the first night in Sao Paulo, 
hotel next to the office, and second night in Rio, travel to Rio on Friday 
morning.  Dave, call to discuss or I'll call you, including what would you 
like to do on Saturday, sightseeing, golf, surfing, work?

Subject: Itinerary

I thought this Itinerary might be easier to read.  If you could send me the 
phone number to the Rio de Janeiro office, I would greatly appreciate it.

Also, Dave wanted to know if you could arrange transportation for them.  He 
wants to be sure that we arrange transportation with someone you know.

Thanks very much for your help and please feel free to call me with any 
questions (Kay 713-853-0643).

I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with 
Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and 
very early in discussions that a ""CA"" at this time was not needed.  There 
were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no ""CA"".  Let me 
know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks!

Thanks for your time and patience today.

For now, I'll park the theoretical and focus on the practical.  (we can pick 
up the other topics later over beers sometime)

I completely agree that the US coal-genco business can offer a huge near-term 
win for those that move swiftly.

Thanks for offering me the shot to capitalize on it.

Dave,

Some time back you should have received a voicemail from Paula Rieker 
regarding my seeking a meeting with you.  I was located in India at the time, 
and project Summer was on at the time.  Hence, after a couple of initial 
attempts, I decided to wait a while before I sought a meeting with you.

However, now with Project Summer behind us, I would like to meet with you to 
discuss potential opportunities in the North America Region.  I was part of 
the Associate pool at ECT, and have worked with Jim Fallon and Paula Rieker, 
among others.  I had then taken an assignment to work in India, and have been 
there for some years now.

I am in Houston for the rest of the week and will be seeking to get on your 
calender for a brief chat on opportunities in your group.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Subject: Re: Master Turbine Listing  

Thanks for the note Mat.  Look fwd to supporting your effort as needed!   

Just to insure that ENA and RAC aren't duplicating efforts...., we have been 
told by Rick Buy that he wanted RAC to keep the Enron Turbine ""book"" (with 
input from other business units), and have just concluded multiple sessions 
w/ RAC to xfer that function to them (I think we invited your team to those 
sessions).  Rick Carson/RAC is working on a format that can be used by 
multiple parties, including board presentations.  The idea was that different 
business units (ENA,, EECC, etc) could provide input, and....., RAC's 
involvement would enhance the list.   

If ENA is going to keep ""the turbine book"" - maybe RAC doesn't need to (none 
of our business, but...., doesn't seem like RAC needs to be doing the same 
thing you are doing).    

Who from ENA could discuss this w/ Dave Gorte (Rick's on vacation)?  

Also - do you have a rep that can attend the bi-weekly turbine lunches where 
we go through the list - coordinating turbine efforts across all business 
units?  

Thanks - F.Kelly

Subject: Master Turbine Listing

Tammy Shepperd and myself have been asked to maintain the status of Enron's 
turbine position.  This list includes the 24 LM6000s, all other ENA turbines 
and all Enron turbines to the extent information is available.  The file 
includes 3 worksheets:

Turbine Inventory:  lists the turbine, delivery, ownership, project 
commitment and other related items.
LM6000 Status:  includes delivery, configuration, project commitment and 
other related items.
LM6000 Assign:  less detailed schedule with the delivery, project commitment 
and current availability.

In the future, to maintain the integrity of this information, the file will 
NOT be emailed, but will accessible from the following location in a Read 
Only format:

O:\NAES\Master Turbine Listing.xls

It is our view that requiring users to access the actual directory will be 
the most efficient method of assuring the user is receiving up-to-date 
information.  As project needs arise or change, please email or contact Tammy 
Shepperd at (713) 853-6589 or myself at (713) 853-3526.  In addition, if 
there is other information that would be useful, let us know.

Thanks,
Mathew Gimble
