In today's edition of the Daily Update, Multex Investor director of
investment research Marc Gerstein encourages members to block out the
noise of earnings consensus and focus instead on the big picture.

But while corporate management usually tries to beat or meet consensus

manufacturers may be purposely dampening expectations.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Dampening the mood
Why Nortel (NT) and Lucent (LU) may be playing the reverse-
psychology game

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Lucent Technologies (LU) and Nortel Networks (NT) delivered their
twisted versions of holiday cheer in recent weeks, telling analysts that
sales are slowing yet further, and admitting that forward-looking
estimates will have to come down--yet again.

But with their shares languishing in single-digits despite a broad year-
end Nasdaq rally, analysts have been softening their positions, even to
the point of seeing silver linings in these recent whipping-boy stocks.

Indeed, some analysts believe that the beleaguered telecom equipment
vendors may be deliberately dampening investor enthusiasm and even
underreporting or delaying booking some revenues in order to boost
March 2002-quarter results (and make for easier December 2002
comparisons to boot).

2. INVESTING STRATEGIES
No noise
Silence is golden, both for meditation and investing

By Marc Gerstein

This word, stream, is crucial. Remember it. Write it down on a little slip
of paper and paste it on your computer monitor so you can see it any
time you read an article or research report dealing with company
earnings (or EPS). Any time you hear or read the word ""earnings,"" edit it
in your own mind so that it changes to ""earnings stream."" This is
essential for you to make truly rational earnings-based investment
decisions.

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
American Eagle Outfitters (AEOS)
Weak sales reports present great buying opportunities for American
Eagle Outfitters

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research, Multex Investor

I've been hearing how rotten retail is for years now. There are too many
malls. There are too many stores. Consumers are bored with shop-till-
you-drop. Consumers don't have enough money. You name it, I heard it.

For your sake though, I hope that if I featured it, you bought it. Thus far,
I've profiled retailers 21 times (including two follow-ups for previously
featured stocks). As of the 1/11/02 market close, the average percent
change of the retail stocks we featured was +35.9 percent (including one
dot-com dud that lost 80.8 percent). The equivalent average percent
change was a 16.0 percent loss for the S&P 500 and -35.3 percent for
the Nasdaq 100.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
B is for ""bubble""
Supply chain software stocks surge--but why?

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

It's dj vu all over again, as stocks of supply chain software vendors i2
Technologies (ITWO), Manugistics (MANU), and SAP (SAP), among
others, have climbed sharply in recent months. These stocks were
among the highest flyers at the height of the Internet bubble, and it's fair
to wonder if investors are slipping back into that old bugaboo, irrational
exuberance.

The surge in prices is based on a fairly dubious investment thesis: sales
are no longer falling and the worst may be over. But sales are not yet
rising either. And analysts are compelled to look several years out to
justify current stock prices.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Dorland, Dan  
Sent:	Wednesday, January 16, 2002 4:27 PM
To:	Milnthorp, Rob
Subject:	Follow up on our conversation

Rob,

I would just like to follow up on our conversation and clarify any confusion you may have about where I stand. I have loved working for Enron over the past two years and have gained invaluable experience. I look forward to harnessing the opportunities in Ontario under the UBS banner and working with the former Enron team. Recently there have been a considerable number of companies soliciting Enron people familiar with the electricity market in Ontario. I evaluated the opportunities on the table and had come to a decision about my future, I want to stay with the team at Netco.

I communicated to Paul that I did not feel that the retail opportunity was rewarding enough to leave. He said that he would follow up with you to get back to me with more specifics on my role within Netco and to see if I have the opportunity to get into trading. It came as quite a shock to me when you mentioned my place within Netco had been compromised. I never gave Paul any commitment to join him on a retail venture or empowered him to speak on my behalf!

Rob, I apologize for this confusion and truly appreciate your understanding. I realize that the experience I stand to gain, the caliber of people I will work with, the credibility or the organization I will work for and my future earning potential will be significantly higher if I stay with the team and join UBS. I am confident that I know this market as well as anyone in this office, and I will continue to work hard to add value to the new organization.

Again, thanks for your support and please accept my apologies for the any miscommunication.

Sincerely,

Dan Dorland

Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Strategic sourcing
Streamlined processes and lower costs create new investment
opportunities

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

B2B e-commerce stocks suffered from highly publicized plummets
during the last two years, placing weaker players in jeopardy, but
since September this group has seen an impressive run-up in the
shares of some stocks. Far from being on the verge of extinction,
it's a sector with multi-trillion-dollar potential, a piece of which
many vendors are trying to grab.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Surprise party invitation
Investors are in the dark, so why not be in on the surprise?

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Many investors are holding off buying stocks until they've had a chance
to check out earnings releases that will pour in over the next month. But
this is a good time to check out stocks that have a strong chance of
exceeding expectations. Buy them now, and an upside surprise could
lend a boost to your portfolio.

exciting offer from Phillips Publishing Inc.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Investor,

I know you're frustrated by the lousy market over the past 18 months.
But I warn you...

...now is not the time to start taking big risks in hope of making up
for lost time.  You'll just end up in a bigger hole. And frankly, it
just isn't necessary to take chances to achieve great profits.  There is
a much better, time-tested way.

YOU CAN become an ""Armadillo Investor.""

The armadillo is nature's perfect survivor.  A thick plate of armor.
Sharp claws.  And a clear focus on the hunt.  Armadillo Investors build
profits aggressively -- but we also use proven techniques to protect
against the losses most investors inevitably suffer.  Our mantra: ""Win
at investing by never losing.""

I don't take big risks when hunting for oversized profits.  I simply
follow the armadillo strategy that has made me wealthy -- and made
thousands of investors who've followed my advice quite wealthy, as well.
 Here's just one example of an Armadillo stock we're recommending today
-- I think you'll see why it's the kind of investment EVERY investor
should own.

This company has achieved 31 consecutive years of revenue growth!  It's
gained 72% for us so far this year.  That sounds like heaven, compared
to the hell most investors have been sliding through.

I came upon this story in an afternoon of serendipity.  Debbie and I
were out riding our Harleys on a beautiful fall day when we passed an
impressive-sized store in South Deerfield, Massachusetts.  While that's
not exactly the middle-of-nowhere, it's close.  And the huge parking lot
was JAMMED with hundreds of cars.

At first, I thought it must be a mall.  Curiosity got the best of us, so
we stopped for a peek.  No mall.  Just a single store, selling just one
product line, with folks lined up at the registers ten-deep!  Okay, this
was something worth checking out, so I put my research team on it.

It turns out that this store is the second most-visited tourist
destination in Massachusetts.  And it's the front for one of the
most-amazing little companies I've ever run across -- devoted followers,
fat profit margins and some heavy hitters behind the scenes.  Directors
include Hollywood deal man Michael Ovitz, the president of Staples and
the chairman of J. Crew.  This is just a neat story that can make you a
lot of money.

I outline the best ways to profit from this Armadillo and 4 more in my
new FREE report: ARMADILLO STOCKS: 5 INVESTMENTS THAT WIN BY NEVER
LOSING. This new report is yours absolutely FREE for the asking.
Nothing to buy.  Nothing to try.  No cost.  No commitment.  No kidding.

Just read it and profit.

Why am I giving this report away FREE?  Because it's the best way I know
to introduce you to my advisory service.

Each month in INTELLIGENCE REPORT we outline the profit champions of
tomorrow.  We call them ""armadillo stocks"" because they have sharp claws
to rake in fat profits and a hard shell for protection from competitors
and recession.

Simply read this new free special report to learn all about 5 Armadillo
Stocks that will weather any storm.

INVESTools Advisory
Compiled by John Brobst, INVESTools.com


1. Hot Market, Consistent Earnings for Microcap (NEOG)

Jonathan Steinberg says Wall Street's spotlight may soon
shine on Neogen (NEOG). Earnings consistency (21 consecutive
profitable quarters) and heightened interest in protecting
the nation's food supply pushed shares of Neogen (NEOG) to
all-time highs in November 2001. Steinberg notes that this
move boosted the firm's market cap to over $100 million.
""Now that it crossed that threshold, it is likely to appear
on the radar screens of small-cap managers,"" he says.

Neogen develops and markets products and services for food
and animal safety; the recent shift in public attention to
the safety of basic infrastructure, such as food supply,
seems a readymade opportunity for Neogen, Steinberg says. In
fiscal 2001, sales boomed 44% for its diagnostic test kits
that detect foodborne bacteria and other toxins. The firm
grew its operating income by $1.9 million without incurring
comparable hikes in expenses, and margins rose 12.2% as a
result.

Steinberg sees annual sales growing from today's $35 million
to over $600 million in short order, and he predicts EPS
will rise 26% to $0.68 in 2002. A growing number of health-
conscious consumers and a more security-conscious government
will lead to even greater demand for Neogen's products, he
says. Steinberg advises buying today and anticipates a share
price of $36 by early 2003.

For more on Jonathan Steinberg's advice see ""This Month's
Recommendation,"" January 2002, Individual Investor's Special
Situations Report. Jonathan Steinberg provides one
undervalued stock per month poised for substantial growth
and profit.

----------------------------------------------------------
2. Government Small Pox Deal a Boon for Biotech Firm (BREL)

A huge contract to help supply the US government with 200
million doses of small pox vaccine caused a surge in shares
of Bioreliance (BREL). Buy signs soon came from growth stock
guru Jim Collins (OTC Insight) and his former pupil Louis
Navellier (MPT Review). That in turn prompted newsletter
watcher Gregory Spear to add shares to his Security
Portfolio of stocks expected to benefit from higher spending
on security and safety.

Bioreliance provides contract manufacturing and testing
services to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The firm
is a major subcontractor to Acambis and Baxter, who test and
develop the vaccine for the government. Shares of
Bioreliance more than doubled since September 11 and are now
consolidating near their all-time highs.

Spear is excited at how Q3 net income grew 500% on a 29%
increase in revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. ""Look
for a dip and then stash some shares away. It's a great buy-
and-hold candidate,"" he says.

Letters,"" December 24, 2001, The Spear Report. Consensus
stock picks from the best performing advisory services in

3. Zacks: Time to Buy Equities (AZO)

Ben Zacks is bullish for the first time in over 2-1/2 years.
""We are decidedly more bullish about the market than we were
just two weeks ago. It is time to start aggressively putting
money to work,"" he says. He predicts a surge in corporate
profits during H1 2002 as today's recession forced companies
to cut costs and layoff staff. Stock prices are rallying
despite poor earnings reports, and that tells Zacks that
earnings should grow substantially next year.

One stock Zacks recommends buying is Autozone (AZO). The
nation's #1 auto parts chain sells parts, maintenance items
and accessories through over 3,000 stores in 42 states. The
firm's board of directors just approved a $250 million stock
repurchase bringing its recent total to $1.45 billion.

Autozone's sales and earnings momentum are compelling, and
Wall Street analysts see this growth accelerating. Same-
store sales grew an impressive 9% in Q1, and EPS of $0.76
zoomed past the consensus analyst estimates of $0.60. Shares
now trade at 23x the current year's estimate of $3.13 and
20x next year's estimate of $3.75. ""A good entry point for
new investors is $70,"" Zacks says.

For more on Ben Zacks' advice see ""Timely Buys of the
Month,"" Mid-December 2001, Zacks Advisor. Ben Zacks uses
earnings estimate revisions from analysts at brokerages to
select stocks likely to outperform the market over the next
12 months.

4. Seven Supersafe Stocks for Capital Gains in 2002 (MYL)

The major market averages have rallied on expectations of a
rebound in the economy and earnings. But Rich Moroney is not
convinced. He says the time-tested Dow Theory has not yet
confirmed that the current upturn is anything but a bear
market rally. ""Our bottom-line advice: maintain 33% of
equity portfolios in short-term reserves. Avoid richly
valued tech stocks, and consider small and mid-sized
companies in your search for reasonably valued growth
stocks."" he says.

Moroney offers seven stocks he calls ""2002 capital gains
favorites,"" and one of these is Mylan Laboratories (MYL).
The firm sells 140 generic and branded drugs. Wall Street
sees revenues growing from $846 million this year to $931
million next year and then to $1 billion the following year.
A long slate of patent expirations at big drug companies
should drive Mylan's revenues for years to come, Moroney
says.

Meanwhile, Mylan is growing its own product pipeline of new
drugs, and those should bolster profit margins
significantly. In fact, management sees 50% of all revenues
coming from branded drugs soon. Mylan handily beat estimates
for the last three quarters, and Moroney sees new drugs
leading to positive earnings surprises. ""The stock is being
upgraded to 'buy,'"" he says.

For more on Rich Moroney's advice see ""Featured Report,""
December 24, 2001, Dow Theory Forecasts. Rich Moroney uses
the time-tested Dow Theory to provide stock picks and
portfolios and to keep investors on the right side of major
market trends.

CHRIS'S VERSION 2

I would just like to follow up on our conversation and clarify any confusion you may have about where I stand. I have loved working for Enron over the past two years and have gained invaluable experience. I look forward to harnessing the opportunities in Ontario under the UBS banner and working with the former Enron team. Recently there have been a considerable number of companies soliciting Enron people familiar with the electricity market in Ontario. I evaluated the opportunities on the table and had come to a decision about my future, I want to stay with the team at Netco.

I communicated to Paul that I did not feel that the retail opportunity was rewarding enough to leave. He said that he would follow up with you to get back to me with more specifics on my role within Netco. It came as quite a shock to me when you mentioned my place within Netco had been compromised. I never gave Paul any commitment to join him on XYZ retail venture or empowered him to speak on my behalf! (or something to that effect)

Rob, I apologize for this confusion and truly appreciate your understanding. I realize that the experience I stand to gain, the caliber of people I will work with, the credibility or the organization I will work for and my future earning potential will be significantly higher if I stay with the team and join UBS. I am confident that I know this market as well as anyone in this office, and I will continue to work hard to add value to the new organization.
 
Again, thanks for your support and please accept my apologies for the any miscommunication.

Sincerely,

Dan Dorland

Rob,

I would just like to follow up on our conversation and perhaps clarify any confusion you may have about what I am thinking. First, I should say that I have loved working for Enron over the past almost two years, gained invaluable experience and sincerely looked forward to harnessing the opportunities in Ontario under that banner and team. However, as a result of the events from the past few months, there was a considerable number of companies soliciting Enron people for the opening of the electricity market in Ontario. Of course, to be prudent, I evaluated the opportunities on the table.

At the same time, I was told that I had been slotted for retention by Netco and looked forward to the opportunity to grow with that business. In retrospect, I guess I was naive to think that I could seriously evaluate retail opportunities with, on the surface, very tantalizing potential compensation and assume that my role in Netco Ontario still resides. So today, I communicated to Paul that I did not feel that the retail opportunity was rewarding enough to leave and he told me that he would follow up with you to get more specifics on what my role within Netco would look like.  So, I was somewhat shocked when you mentioned my place within Netco had been compromised.

In any event, I appologize for this confusion Rob and truly appreciate your understanding. Currently, I do have an offer from a retailer that could significantly increase my current compensation, but I came to the conclusion that the level of experience, people, network, credibility and future earning potential at Netco is at too high of an opportunity cost to leave. I am confident that I know this marketplace as well as anybody in this office, and can add substantial value to the new entity with respect to future earnings and previous activities of the Toronto office. I am also very interested in the opportunity to work in trading.

Thanks again for your support Rob and please accept my appologies for the miscommunications.

Sincerely,

Dan

"January 9, 2002 - Screening for value","
In today's edition of the Daily Update, Multex Investor's director of
investment research, Marc Gerstein, explains why he values Varian
Medical Systems (VAR) so highly.

Also, equity research columnist Dave Sterman has no tax advice to offer,

along the tax advice road.

Morgan Stanley believes that the future of online banking is sure, and

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Varian Medical Systems (VAR)
Varian stock could flourish if investors focus on the company as
effectively as its x-rays focus on cancer.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

Don't feel let down by the fact that VAR today isn't really a heavyweight
airport security play. The company's core business activities are really
quite attractive. The mere fact that VAR is in the healthcare sector starts
it off with a favorable presumption. You know the drill: aging
population, long-term secular growth in demand for all sorts of health-
related products and services. Obviously, not every healthcare stock will
be a winner. But as we'll see below, VAR has solid financial
fundamentals, thereby causing it to easily pass the tests that cause many
firms in this area to falter.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Taxes-dot-com
Two widely different strategies for navigating the tax Web

By Dave Sterman

For the last four years, the number of people filing their taxes online has
risen by at least 20 percent annually. And the folks at Intuit (INTU)
deserve a bunch of credit for the trend. Intuit's TurboTax software has
made it increasingly easy to complete and files taxes electronically,
eliminating the mistake-filled pen and paper process.

Curiously, H&R Block (HRB) has gone a different route. The tax prep
giant has stuck by its bricks and mortar model of handling taxes in
person. Block's TaxCut software also enables people to do their taxes on
a PC, but the company has done little to create a commanding Web
presence.

This $4.50 stock does more sales per year than Amgen, Yahoo and
eBay combined. This stock's net profit last year was almost as much
as eBay's entire gross sales in 2000. No wonder this stock is a
prime takeover target! It was trading around $60 last July and is
now a steal. Buy low!

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The spillover from Enron
New issues to watch for this earnings season

By Rick Wayman, CFA

This earnings season should prove to be especially interesting not only
because of what the bottom lines may indicate, but also because of the
""spin"" that companies will be using. There are several key factors that
will impact earnings in 4Q01 and fiscal year 2001 and seeing how
management will spin these factors should be a learning experience.

To cut through the spin, investors will need to be especially focused on
margins, both gross and operating, and footnotes. The impact will vary
among companies (even in the same sector) depending on their
accounting policies.

Europe: E-business leader?
How do results from SAP (SAP) reflect world markets for e-business

many technology industry observers last week with its preliminary
announcement of strong fourth quarter software license sales. Revenues

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Dumbing down
Being smart is not necessarily the best way to protect yourself from
troublesome accounting.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

Believe it or not, financial engineering may be a worse problem.
Because it's legal, and praised in some circles, more companies are
willing to do it. As noted, financial engineers do not lie. Instead,
they tell you the truth about questions you really ought not be asking,
and distracting you from issues that may be more important.

2. INVESTMENTOR
Hard and soft recessions
Is the market's recent rally the start of a bull run? To answer that
question, look at the economy.

by William Valentine, CFA

Recessions, like boiled eggs, run hard or soft (...he says, scraping the
bottom of the simile barrel).

Hard and soft recessions differ by the damage they inflict and the
amount of time they cover. Not surprisingly, the severity of the recession
dictates the pain the stock market goes through. But since the market
dips and recovers before the economy, it's important to speculate on the
economy when considering whether the most recent stock rally is the
start of a bull run, or a bear market correction.

"Re: Stickley Furniture","Hey Chris,


     How are you doing? Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner regarding
Stickley, but I was doing research to see if I could find any information
about the company.  Unfortunately, I had no success.  I have contacted Mega
group, (our buying group) to see if perhaps they had any information, but...
again another brick wall.  I cannot find a web site, or any listing in
""Furniture Today"" (a listing of all manufacturers in the U.S.)  If I come
across anything I will let you know.  Do you know what pieces in particular
this fellow is looking for?  Perhaps we could source another vendor.??
     If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to call, email,
fax, or send message via messenger pigeon; whichever method you perfer.

Looking forward to your next contact.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Bubble-free bullishness
Has the NASDAQ come too far too fast? Who cares! There are lots of other
great ideas available.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research, Multex Investor
Not everybody agrees with my generally bullish views of the stock
market. That, in itself, is not a big deal. Every day there are both buyers
and sellers, so you can never expect to see unanimity of opinion. What is
interesting is the sort of reasoning I often hear from bears. ""Look how far
Juniper (or any one of countless other circa 1999 market superstars) has
come. It's way ahead of itself."" ""There's been so much overbuilding in
telecom, it will take years before supply and demand come back into
balance."" Etc.
Such sentiments are fine, and for the most part, I agree with them. The
problem I have is that so many bears seem to confine their discussion to
the same group of stocks that mesmerized so many investors during the
bubble days. That's unfortunate. The same mistake that causes so much
financial pain on the way down seems likely to strike again. The source
of the pain: an inappropriately narrow view of the market that focuses
too much attention on too few stocks that often have too little investment
merit.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Amid industry funk, satellite radio makes dazzling debut
Analysts expect near-term pullback, but like the segment's
potential

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Perhaps you missed it. Amid the turmoil and growing economic uncertainty
of late 2001, XM Satellite Radio (XMSR) completed one of the most
successful consumer electronic product launches in years.

The company completed the national rollout of its digital audio radio
service, which delivers digital quality radio to cars via satellite. XMSR now
offers 100 channels coast to coast for a fee of $9.99 per month.

The company launched regionally in September and nationally in
November. By year-end, it had more than 30,000 subscribers. Analysts
agree that this level of success for a discretionary subscription-based
service during a severe economic downturn is exceptional.

Revived Enron Trading Unit Unlikely To Regain Top Spot
By Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and Jason Leopold

01/11/2002 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It's too soon to tell how successful a revived Enron Corp. (ENE) trading operation might be, but it's almost certain never to regain its once-dominant market position, energy experts and executives said. 
UBS AG (UBS), which Enron chose Friday as the winning bidder for its North American natural gas and electricity trading business, may bring the credit quality needed to get Enron's traders back in the market. But energy companies that picked up market share as Enron collapsed won't let it go easily, and Enron's once vaunted name is now seen by most as a liability. 
""The question is whether it will be a market leader and as profitable as it once was. I'm doubtful it will be,"" said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank in New York. ""I think UBS could restart the business, but they will have an ongoing problem of keeping Enron's traders in-house. It will also be hard for UBS to convince Enron's former counterparties to start trading with a reconstituted Enron. The brand has been enormously damaged."" 
Enron, once the country's largest trader of power and gas, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and has been scrambling since to find financially sound partners to help revive its wholesale power trading unit, which was responsible for 90% of the company's $101 billion revenue last year.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power

1. Strong buy: License to ring
Licensing DSL technology could help position Aware (AWRE) for the future.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

An uncertain economic environment and a semiconductor market at
trough revenue levels means that this may be a good time for
investors to look into the semiconductor intellectual property
(SIP) sector.

In the broadband communications field, Aware (AWRE) develops and
licenses DSL technology to semiconductor and equipment companies
for use in conjunction with existing copper telephone networks.
The company also makes software for IP products for voice- and
video-enabled applications and video games.

Aware mainly competes with other companies' in-house development
and design teams, and with many corporations looking for cost-
cutting options, Aware is in a strong position to cash in.

2. Independent exchanges: How the survivors have evolved
From passive transaction-based units to active technology providers and, ultimately, proselytizers

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

At the beginning of 2001, eMarketer selected five so-called
""independent exchanges"" that we believed were worth watching
during the course of the year. Chosen for the diversity of their
vertical industry operations, these benchmark exchanges were
noted as useful indicators of the success or failure of online
exchange-based trade within various industries.
Known as a pioneer within the energy industry and among business-
to-business (B2B) exchanges in general, Altra Market Place was
placed on the list because of its background as a facilitator of
commodity-based trade. Citadon has long emphasized its Web-based,
collaborative software for the engineering and building industry,
while eMerge Interactive (EMRG) was initially known as a cattle
broker with extensive online and offline trading operations.
MetalSite was selected because of its presence within the highly-
competitive online steel-trading industry, and SciQuest (SQST)
was noted for its leadership as a provider of Internet-based
catalog and trading technology for the life sciences industry.

3. The real deal: Five fateful days
Five January days that could determine the course of the year, and four picks from the guru

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

After a two-year route that saw the market experience it's worse
performance since 1973-74, investors are going to begin the year
hoping for the best but not forcing the issue. Reluctance to buy
this market could result in a lackluster first week.

The old saying is that as January goes, so goes the rest of the
year (in fact traditionalists say the first five days of the year
will determine the outcome for the rest of the year). I'm not so
sure that will be applicable to the market this year.

Instead, it could be the last 5 days of the month that sets the
tone for the rest of the year. On the 29th, the Fed gathers for
the first FOMC meeting of the year. After 11 rate cuts last year,
it will be interesting to see whether Greenspan and company
decide to take the scalpel to rates again. We think the market
has a better chance of making a serious rally if the Fed chooses
to stand pat.

4. Click and file: Taxes-dot-com
Two widely different strategies for navigating the tax Web

By Dave Sterman

For the last four years, the number of people filing their taxes
online has risen by at least 20 percent annually. And the folks
at Intuit (INTU) deserve a bunch of credit for the trend.
Intuit's TurboTax software has made it increasingly easy to
complete and files taxes electronically, eliminating the mistake-
filled pen and paper process.

Curiously, H&R Block (HRB) has gone a different route. The tax
prep giant has stuck by its bricks and mortar model of handling
taxes in person. Block's TaxCut software also enables people to
do their taxes on a PC, but the company has done little to create
a commanding Web presence.

1. B2B E-Commerce Leader Turns Profitable (FMKT)

Despite recent gains, Internet stocks excite few investors
these days. That's why Carlton Lutts is buying. His newest
pick is FreeMarkets (FMKT), a maker of B2B marketplaces for
a number of major sectors. For instance, aerospace giant
United Technologies saved 17% by using FreeMarkets to hold
over 2,000 auctions representing $1.5 billion of purchasing
contracts. Automotive parts and accessories supplier Visteon
is another major customer.

Instead of trying to supplant a company's purchasing
department, FreeMarkets aims to provide a valuable tool for
buyers to do their work. The company's 1,000+ employees put
in a lot of effort to learn a client's business and ensure
that the auction site is tailor made and user friendly.
FreeMarkets also adds value by actively seeking out
qualified suppliers and creating detailed requests for
quotes.

Lutts says financial results show that FreeMarkets' model
is working. The firm projects an operating profit of $0.05
to $0.09 per share for Q4 and $0.22 for 2002. Investors
jumped on the news and quickly bid up shares from $15 to
$25 in December 2001. ""It has held those gains well, and
thus we rate it buy,"" he says. ""Investors have a hunger
for real earnings, and FreeMarkets is turning the corner
on profitability.""

Inspector,"" January 4, 2002. Momentum advisor Carlton Lutts

each week.

2. Insider Buys Indicate ""Grossly Oversold Prices"" (VTA)

Substantial insider buying at Vesta Insurance Group (VTA)

bargain. Last November, the firm reported a decline in net
operating earnings for the quarter. Shares quickly dropped
50%, and insiders just as quickly grabbed the stock. Cuneo
says this indicates management sees ""grossly oversold
prices"" and ""the first indication of insider enthusiasm year
to date.""

Vesta would have reported a profit from continuing
operations for the quarter. But a pre-tax charge of $30
million to settle securities litigation pushed a $1.3
million gain to an $18.2 million loss. Management sees final
court approval for the settlement by the year's end. In the
mean time, the firm is in good financial shape and plans to
repurchase over six million shares.

Cuneo says the buyback plan combined with the aggressive
moves of insiders make Vesta ""a solid candidate for
inclusion in our Risk Portfolio."" He recently added shares
and maintains a buy recommendation.

Insider Index Rankings,"" January 16, 2002, Vickers Weekly
Insider. Richard Cuneo provides the most up-to-date

3. Mutual Fund Trading Strategy Shines Amid Turmoil (CSVFX)

Investors spent the past two years unlearning the lessons of
the booming late 1990s. For instance, one lesson was to buy
on dips as those who did this lost mightily since early
2000. Janet Brown's strategy continued to outperform even
when the market turned south. She invests in top mutual
funds while they are performing well and nimbly moves to
others when the original choices no longer perform the best.
By doing this, she profits regardless of what kind of fund
is currently in favor.

One of the funds Brown advises buying now is Columbia
Strategic Value (CSVFX). ""While many growth funds found the
transition to value difficult, CSVFX delivered spectacular
performance since its fortuitous inception in November
2000,"" she says. That could be because of what Brown calls
""a growthy complexion"" to a fund whose main objective is
value.

One third of the fund's portfolio is short-term growth and
special situation opportunities while the rest is
traditional value. By value, fund managers mean P/E and
price-to-sales ratios less than those of the S&P 500 index.
Current holdings include infrastructure industries like
transportation, cement, natural gas and others likely to
benefit if government decides to refurbish after neglect in
the late 1990s.

For more on Janet Brown's advice see ""The Complete NoLoad
Fund*X,"" January 2002, No-Load Fund*X. Janet Brown offers
leading insight on no-load and low-load mutual funds,
including advice on when to upgrade to the winners.

4. The Latest Addition to a String of Tech Stock Hits (MTON)

The portfolios of investors who bought Geoff Eiten's top
monthly tech stock picks have performed admirably over the
last year. Sample gains include +22% since July 2001 on
Extreme Networks, +144% since May 2001 on OmniVision
Technologies, +37% on ADC Telecommunications since April
2001, and +39% since March 2001 on Portal Software.

Eiten's latest tech stock pick is Metro One
Telecommunications (MTON). The firm provides directory
assistance and information services to telecom providers
like Sprint PCS, AT&T Wireless, Nextel, Verizon Wireless and
Cingular Wireless. Metro One charges its clients $0.75 to
$1.40 per call plus airtime for each use of its services.
The firm handled roughly 218 million calls during the first
six months of 2001.

Eiten is bullish about Metro One as competitive pressures
force carriers to bundle more and more services into one
package, and the firm's directory assistance service is the
best of the breed. Last quarter saw revenues grow 42% to $60
million while net income ballooned 174% to $7.6 million.
Eiten just issued a buy recommendation.

For more on Geoff Eiten's advice see ""Technology Stock
Watch,"" January 2002, OTC Growth Stock Watch. Geoff Eiten
advises on high-growth, low long-term debt, niche-oriented
firms with sales of $5-100 million.

5. Harmon's Top Stocks and Sectors for 2002 (MSFT)

Before discussing his best bets for year 2002, Steve Harmon
lists what he believes the year will not be about. ""Not
Internet. Not wireless. Not e-commerce. Not infrastructure.
Not fiber optics,"" he says. Instead, he predicts 2002 will
be about practical solutions. ""Technologies that make
businesses run better, cut costs and improve earnings.
Everything else is hype.""

Harmon predicts manufacturing-intensive firms like Ford will
continue to lay off tens of thousands as technology takes
over many aspects of the supply chain and labor. That means
growth in fields like automation, robotics and procurement
systems. ""This is all heavy lifting and the companies most
likely to benefit are gorilla technology solution
providers,"" Harmon says, including Microsoft (MSFT), Intel
(INTC), IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), Cisco (CSCO) and Texas
Instruments (TXN).

Harmon also reiterates his buy sign on the Nasdaq QQQ series
trust shares (QQQ) designed to mirror the performance of the
Nasdaq 100 index. QQQ gives substantial exposure to
technology and healthcare, sectors that Harmon calls
""engines of the recovering economy."" He advises maintaining
stop loss limits of 10% on QQQ, 15% on large cap techs and
20% on everything else.

For more on Steve Harmon's advice see ""Harmon New Technology
Stocks,"" January 2002, Broadband Investor. Steve Harmon puts
investors at the forefront of the convergence of technology,
entertainment, communication, commerce and fiber-optics.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Matt,

That is cool. I can't really change the trip but I am sure I will be back in
Vancouver soon. Send me your vitals and I'll let you know the next time I am
in town. Or give me shout if you are ever out in Calgary. Do you have
Atkinson's office phone number? I seem to have misplaced it.

"UBS to cut 300 jobs at Enron trading unit - paper","Monday January 28, 6:05 am Eastern Time 
UBS to cut 300 jobs at Enron trading unit - paper
FRANKFURT, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS will cut about 300 of 800 jobs at the energy trading unit purchased from Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) but plans no additional cuts in the rest of the group, UBS chief Peter Wuffli said in a newspaper interview on Monday. 
Wuffli said absorbing the energy trading unit into the financial group would not mean additional risks for the bank, as the new unit would be absorbed completely into UBS's risk-management system, he told German daily Handelsblatt. 
Wuffli, President of the banking group's executive board since December, said he expected the energy trading unit to return to its old business volumes in six to twelve months. 
He repeated earlier statements that the UBS group, which includes Switzerland's biggest bank and London-based investment bank UBS Warburg, planned no additional layoffs to counter the effects of an economic downturn.

09:15 EST Tuesday, January 29, 2002
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy trader Enron Corp. on Tuesday named restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper as interim chief executive to lead it out of its record Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Enron also said Lawrence Whalley resigned as president and chief operating officer and will be replaced by Jeff McMahon, currently chief financial officer.
Cooper, managing principal of New York- and Los Angeles-based restructuring firm Zolfo Cooper, was picked to replace embattled former Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, who resigned on Wednesday. The bankruptcy creditors' committee had pressured Lay to step down.
Cooper has helped restructure several troubled companies, including appliance maker Sunbeam Corp. , retailer Federated Department Stores Inc. and construction conglomerate Morrison Knudsen.

Rob,

I would just like to follow up on our conversation and clarify any confusion you may have about where I stand. I have loved working for Enron over the past two years and have gained invaluable experience. I look forward to harnessing the opportunities in Ontario under the UBS banner and working with the former Enron team. Recently there have been a considerable number of companies soliciting Enron people familiar with the electricity market in Ontario. I evaluated the opportunities on the table and had come to a decision about my future, I want to stay with the team at Netco.

I communicated to Paul that I did not feel that the retail opportunity was rewarding enough to leave. He said that he would follow up with you to get back to me with more specifics on my role within Netco and to see if I have the opportunity to get into trading. It came as quite a shock to me when you mentioned my place within Netco had been compromised. I never gave Paul any commitment to join him on a retail venture or empowered him to speak on my behalf!

Rob, I apologize for this confusion and truly appreciate your understanding. I realize that the experience I stand to gain, the caliber of people I will work with, the credibility or the organization I will work for and my future earning potential will be significantly higher if I stay with the team and join UBS. I am confident that I know this market as well as anyone in this office, and I will continue to work hard to add value to the new organization.

Again, thanks for your support and please accept my apologies for the any miscommunication.

Sincerely,

Dan Dorland

"30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION -- $227 Value!","As a valued member of the INVESTools community, you've
asked to be notified about new investment tools, features,
and money-saving opportunities from INVESTools and our
strategic partners.  We think you'll be interested in this
exciting offer from Erlanger Squeeze Play.

**** A FREE 30-DAY TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION to Erlanger Squeeze Play, PLUS
bonuses, altogether worth $227! Learn why the biggest names on Wall
Street follow Phil Erlanger's buy and sell recommendations ****


Dear INVESTools Subscriber,

Have you ever wondered whom the ""experts"" on Wall Street or even
investment newsletter editors listen to when they're investing for
themselves?

The truth is that most ""investment gurus"" would rather walk on a bed of
red-hot coals than admit that any of their competitors or even friends
are good at what they do, much less be big enough to admit that they're
taking advice from them.

You know the game. They want you believe they're the only ""guru"" on the
face of the earth that you can trust for solid investing advice.

Meanwhile, many of Wall Street's most powerful and mega-rich insiders
including:

*	Peter Lynch of Fidelity Investments
*	Jeff Vinik, former manager of Fidelity Magellan
*	More than 100 top fund companies, collectively managing
	over 1 trillion dollars...

...have been glued to the buy/sell recommendations of one amazing man
-- Phil Erlanger. They follow his advice because he has a reputation of
being a genius.

Phil Erlanger is a mathematical computer whiz who has developed a
scientific method of pinpointing investor sentiment that allows him to
tell whether a stock is going to go up or down with an incredible
degree of mathematical certainty -- many say it's almost
""supernatural."" This is the reason Phil Erlanger has been highly
regarded as the top-secret weapon for the biggest insiders on Wall
Street.

Because Phil's newsletter wasn't available to investors like you (until
now), many of those big shots on Wall Street been able to side-step the
""from whom do you take investment advice"" question. Even more relevant,
Phil's newsletter and the price tag of his service -- $30,000 -- made
subscribing impossible for most of our subscribers. Wall Street can't
keep their ""secret weapon"" secret any longer.

Phil Erlanger is making his groundbreaking, scientifically-precise
method of investing available to investors for the first time for just
$295 a year, or $29.95 per month. As one investment newsletter familiar
with Phil Erlanger and his newsletter recently said:

""I hate to admit it, but Phil's newsletter is AMAZING, and any investor
who doesn't subscribe to Erlanger Squeeze Play is missing out. Anyone
with a brain should subscribe immediately.""

Now you can through this limited offer. Try Erlanger Squeeze Play FREE
for 30 days. But that's not all! Counting the 30-DAY FREE TRIAL
SUBSCRIPTION and the bonuses we'll send you, this offer is worth over
$227!

It's an amazing opportunity that we think few other financial
publications would have the guts to offer. Phil's so convinced that
once you've enjoyed a trial subscription and have read Phil Erlanger's
special reports, you'll do back flips and love his newsletter -- you'll
want to be a subscriber for life.

How can you argue with a FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION plus bonuses
altogether worth $227?

We're thrilled to introduce you to Phil Erlanger, and happy to offer
you this trial subscription and bonuses -- worth $227!

   Erlanger Squeeze Play tells you when to buy and when to sell.

Every month, by e-mail or fax, you'll receive a monthly issue, then
throughout the month you'll also receive special Squeeze Alerts. These
are urgent buy and sell recommendations as well as updates and comments
from Phil Erlanger himself -- from his mind to yours in a matter of
minutes.

You'll get the kind of edge that Wall Street's most successful and
powerful insiders plop down $30,000 a year to receive. They're happy to
pay, because his recommendations virtually guarantee success.

      Phil goes through a time-consuming, mathematical ordeal
                     every day to make you rich

Every day, Phil Erlanger uses his revolutionary computer programs to
sift through 6,000 stocks and dozens of stock indexes, searching for
the opportunities that will make you wealthy. It's an enormous task:
the variables are staggering, and the numbers are constantly moving.
It's like trying to hit a moving target traveling at 500 miles per
hour.

Make no mistake about it; his computers go through a time-consuming,
computational ordeal every day. For even the most advanced investor or
sophisticated technical analyst, recreating this data would be
impossible. But incredibly, Phil has done it. We've seen his
recommendations deliver a string of profits including 75%, 89%, 101%,
even 431% in just the past several months. But these profits are just a
tiny glimpse of the profits he's been generating over the last 10
years.

Erlanger Squeeze Play is a serious, no-nonsense trading newsletter --
it's not about glossy bonus reports on the top 3 stocks you should buy
and hold for 12, 24, or 36 months. Phil Erlanger doesn't work that way.
Phil's revolutionary scientific method of trading requires fast, fresh
data and speed of light communications.

Sign up for a 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION TODAY, and you'll receive:

*	Erlanger Squeeze Play sent by e-mail or fax. Clear, concise, and
incredibly powerful, each issue is packed with the kind of money making
advice that can make you incredibly wealthy.

*	Phil Erlanger's Squeeze Alerts, also sent by e-mail or fax. Each
Squeeze Alert will contain exciting trade recommendations, market
analysis, and follow-ups on open positions. You'll think you've found
the Holy Grail. Over the course of this trial subscription alone,
you'll receive 2-4 Squeeze Alerts. Over the course of a one-year
subscription, you'll receive at least 35 of these special alerts.

*	A FREE Voice Alert service to ensure that you never miss one of
Phil's trade recommendations.  We've made arrangements with a cutting
edge messaging provider to give you the ability - at your option - to
be notified by phone every time Phil sends out an alert.  So, if you're
on the road or busy at the office and you're not sitting by your
computer or fax machine, the automatic messaging system will call you
and tell you there's been a new issue or alert sent.

*	Your own private username and password for Phil Erlanger's
Website at http://bonnie.investools.com/T/A21.49.1003.1.306258, which
will give you around-the-clock access anywhere in the world to his
latest analyses and recommendations.

*	Phil's new special report: ""How to Read the Crowd and Squeeze a
Fortune Out of Wall Street,"" worth $99. This exciting special report
shatters the popular myths of investing and explains in detail why
Phil's revolutionary approach to trading stocks and indexes works so
well, time and time again.

*	Phil's second bonus report, ""How I Avoided the Big Tech Crash,""
worth $99. In this report, Phil lays out in detail the methodology that
allowed his clients to completely escape the disastrous Nasdaq crash
from 5,000.

  There are just two perfectly reasonable catches to this special
                 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION!

This 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION is worth $227, but is yours free --
ZERO COST! No smoke, no mirrors -- just TWO very reasonable catches:

First, this is a very limited offer. One 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION
per person, family, or address, etc. Trust me -- you'll only need 30
days to enjoy Erlanger Squeeze Play and see for yourself why so many of
Wall Street's ""experts"" follow Phil Erlanger to generate huge profits.

Second, you must call Cecilia at 1-888-570-2090 or 1-561-750-7719 to
sign up for this free offer, and you must provide us with a valid
credit card and expiration date. After 30 days Erlanger's staff will
automatically start billing your credit card $29.95 a month for your
subscription to Erlanger Squeeze Play until you tell them to stop.

The first 30 days are a gift to you -- a 30-DAY FREE TRIAL
SUBSCRIPTION. Thereafter, you pay the normal monthly price. This
monthly billing agreement guarantees that Phil Erlanger will show you
healthy profits each month, or you can pull the plug on him at any
time. If he doesn't do the job, he gets dumped. On the other hand, if
he shows you the kinds of profits he's been delivering for Wall
Street's insiders, you'll stay aboard.

That's what they call ""singing for your supper""!

This offer is only valid for the next 72 hours. We begged Phil to
extend this offer for a longer period, but he is just starting to make
his publication available to private investors, and he wants to start
off slowly. Up until now, his subscribers have been a small number of
Wall Street's insiders. You're going to be among a precious, small
group of private investors to receive his newsletter and his buy/sell
recommendations.

Understand that during the next 30 days you will receive Erlanger
Squeeze Play absolutely FREE. No smoke, no mirrors. You will also
receive two bonuses: Phil's special report, ""How to Read the Crowd and
Squeeze a Fortune Out of Wall Street,"" worth $99, and Phil's second
bonus report, ""How I Avoided the Big Tech Crash,"" worth $99, in which
Phil lays out in detail the methodology that allowed his clients to
completely escape the disastrous Nasdaq crash from 5,000.

Only after your 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION is completed, your
credit card will be charged $29.95 a month for your subscription to
Erlanger Squeeze Play. Your subscription may be cancelled at any time,
at which time this billing will be stopped.

Call Cecilia at 1-888-570-2090 or 1-561-750-7719 to accept this 30-DAY
FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION -- the gift of Erlanger Squeeze Play. You get
his recommendations FREE for 30 days, and he gets a chance to show you
how incredibly profitable Erlanger Squeeze Play is. What could be
fairer?

"UBS to Pay Enron 33 Pct of Unit Profits","Tuesday January 15 8:33 AM ET 
UBS to Pay Enron 33 Pct of Unit Profits
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enron Corp (NYSE:ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) and Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSZn.VX <http://UBSZn.VX>) on Tuesday detailed their agreement to split profits from Enron's trading business, the one-time crown jewel of the collapsed company. 
Under the terms of a deal worked out over the weekend, UBS Warburg, a unit of Switzerland's largest bank, UBS A.G., would take over the unit and pay Enron 33 percent of profits over a period of up to 10 years, according to a bankruptcy court filing. UBS will assume no liabilities from the trading business. 
Enron announced late last week that UBS Warburg won a bidding contest over Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=c&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/c.html>) for an energy trading business that accounted for most of Enron's revenue last year. The company did not disclose the details of the sale at the time, however, and delayed the highly anticipated release on Tuesday. 
The 10-year deal gives UBS Warburg the right to buy one-third of Enron's royalty interest in the third year of the deal for an amount based on the previous year's profit. UBS could buy another one-third in year four of the contract and the final one-third in year five, the company said. 
The deal still requires approval of Judge Arthur Gonzales of federal bankruptcy court, where Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection in the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. A hearing is scheduled for Friday.

"Status of Offers","Hi everyone,
This is a case of ""no news is actually bad news"".  I've spoken with Kelly several times today and each time we thought we were getting close but we've still got one wrinkle left to iron out.  It is unlikely that it will happen today but we will do everything we can to see if we can make it happen tomorrow.  

On the plus side, the closing date of the offers will be 3 days after we receive them so we shouldn't have to make any rash decisions. 

Sorry guys - let's keep our fingers crossed for tomorrow....

Boulanger and a bunch of my buddies will be doing this for the Super Bowl
(see below).  You should check it out.

Craig



 Gents,


With the void created by Pearson's absence I think I have found a Super Bowl
party worthy of our attendance.

The Deal:

Cowboy's - Sunday February 3rd.

Topless Waitresses, and a half time lesbian show, I assure I am not making
this up!

Tickets are $30.00

Seeing as this invite came to me by way of a friend of friend, I would
appreciate if it was all kept on the hush hush and please don't pass this
along to anyone else.  You were all chosen for a reason.

As you can imagine tickets are selling fast so let me know tomorrow at the
latest and I will arrange to get you a ticket.

Kindest Regards,

Warren Moon

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Why $30 and not $130?
Buying stocks without knowing why prices are what they are is
dangerous to your financial health.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

Here's the moral of the story. You should always, always, always, always
be able, in your mind, to construct some sort of logical connection
between today's stock price and a stream of future dividends. The logical
chain might be long: you might assume years of startup losses will be
followed by more years of all profits being reinvested. But you should be
able to envision some connection between today's stock prices and a
stream of dividends that will commence someday in the future. You don't
actually have to do the math. But you should feel comfortable that the
numbers are such that if you wanted to take the time to do it as an
interesting exercise, you could come up with some plausible set of
assumptions that make the present-day price seem somewhere in the
ballpark.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
A tale of two values
This pair of wireless infrastructure stocks offers long-
term growth--don't let the prices fool you

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

Over the past two years, as the market's become more
challenging, investors are learning to be more selective than they
used to be. Rather than seizing momentum and growth, which
worked well in the '90s, successful investors are adopting a value
orientation.

But which discounted stocks represent true value and which are
inexpensive simply because the company they symbolize is no
good? In telecom, where most stocks have gotten hammered, it
can be especially difficult to distinguish between duds bargains.

"Re: Dan's coming to town...","Hi Chris, yeah I'll be around this weekend and likely up for a drink or two. As long as you don't keep spreading my weekend parties around my office! Just kidding. I actually got an email from Steph at the same time as you telling me about Dan so I don't know who else I would talk to that would care, but I can give it a shot.
Oh yeah...as for the girl I was thinking I should set you up with, she was away last week when you came in but if you're ever wandering around, she sits in the second office in that's behind you when you are standing at the reception desk, her name is Tina and she's one of our financial advisors, really cute & really nice. So you can come check her out and of course stop by and say hi to me.
I'll see you Saturday, if not sooner.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
What is the market's safety net?
Reading the tea leaves of political posturing and Fed pronouncements
for hopes of a recovery

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

Last year, almost every week seemed to be some type of test, or
moment of truth, for the market. Here we are, only two weeks into 2002
and the market is approaching yet another moment of truth. In this case,
the market is walking a very high wire and there doesn't seem to be a net
in sight. After ascending to heights with a mix of bravado and nerve, the
market has paused long enough to look down. All the fun and excitement
that went into the effort to get the markets at their current levels is now
replaced by trepidation and concern. The market would like to find a way
to retrace the climb without tripping up completely. Beginning this week,
and going until the conclusion of the FOMC gathering, the market will
face daily tests and mini-battles that will act as individual moments of
truth. These are the times when sayings like ""don't blink"" or ""don't fall
asleep at the wheel"" come into play. This is an extremely vulnerable
market; everyone knows it, and that universally accepted truth means a
lot of folks are looking for the exits.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Screening for the oversold
The market's guilt-by-association methods create buying opportunities in
telecom

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Sell first, ask questions later. That's the typical investor reaction when
companies warn of a weak quarter. But in their zeal to dump weak
performers, investors often collectively conspire to send share prices
down too far. So we went looking in the telecom universe for stocks that
have taken a sharp hit because of downward guidance. Our logic: these
stocks may actually now be bargains if they've been oversold.

TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE NETCO    
       
Twas the night before NETCO and the pop fridge was bare
and it was not expected that Saint Nick would soon be there.   
No coke, no milk, nor Cplus could the employees find.  
So one by one they would trek down to the lobby and pay a dollar' o five.      
       
On the trading floor of Enron Canada the phones were all quiet 
But the nerf football game in progress was an absolute riot.   
The accountants were busy trying to find us some cash  
But if you talk to ATB they would swear it was hash.   
       
For our leather clad VP's had once ventured forth      
with visions of banking up here in the north.  
Our junior clerk was forced to take back our money.    
A bank not wanting our money, now isn't that funny.    
       
In spite of our troubles, oh the parties we've had!    
Because a good wine or rye makes us feel not so sad.   
The Christmas party was a spectacular gong show
as we showed the country club just how low we could go!
       
The employees' livers have never looked sadder 
Because we need to discuss what exactly is the matter. 
and from a bar stool in the best place to watch
The freefall of Enron to a 26 cent penny stock.
       
But from these ashes the employees will rise   
Despite Lay's, Fastow's and Skillings lies     
Our plan is to emerge as a single A rated NETCO
and then we see who will dominate this trading show!!

1. B2B insights: Internet-based trading networks chip at EDI base
EDI networks stand to lose a lot of business as companies move their purchasing to the Internet.

By Steve Butler

Electronic data interchange (EDI) networks operated by companies such as
General Electric's (GE) Global eXchange Services division are vastly
larger than those operated any Internet-based trading exchange. But time
may be running out faster than a pharmaceutical patent, as cheaper,
potentially more ubiquitous Internet-based exchanges gear up and add
clients both big and small.

For the time being, however, the private EDI operators are in the
driver's seat. As the biggest EDI network operator, GE GXS estimates
that there are more than 100,000 trading partners connected through its
systems, trading more than $1 trillion in transactions annually. The
Giga Information Group estimates that approximately 50,000 trading
partners connect to each other using IBM's (IBM) value-added networks.

2. B2B TV: Interactive software dawns
Cable's upgrade to a digital platform is driving iTV.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

""500 channels and still there's nothing to watch"" may have been what
viewers used to say in the early days of cable and satellite. But this
is the beginning of a new era in television. Not only are channels
getting better and more interesting, but viewers are now being invited
to interact with this medium. And it's interactivity that may make all
the difference.

3. B2B insights: The EnronOnline diaspora
Online energy trading has been orphaned, not aborted

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Although the company is now defunct, and while its behavior has taken a
serious financial toll on many individuals and companies, Enron's legacy
also includes its role as an Internet trailblazer. Indeed, by its sheer
size and ambition, the company was able to change the way that its
competitors traded, permanently and significantly altering both the
energy sector and the Internet.

To get an idea of the magnitude of what we're dealing with, according to
company data, Enron's (ENE) Internet-based trading exchange,
EnronOnline, was processing about 4,000 transactions per day worldwide,
with an average deal size of about $500,000, by September of 2001. At an
annualized rate, the notional value of online transaction activity
conducted through EnronOnline was approximately $510 billion--a healthy
increase from the $101 billion in transactions during 2000.

4. Pent-up aggression: Can EMC (EMC) stay atop the data storage mountain?
Still the market share king, margins and analyst confidence are waning for this former stalwart

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The boom in data storage has become a bust. Prices for data storage gear
have plunged as heavy competition has led to fierce price wars. Few have
taken a deeper hit from the storage sector's comedown than industry
leader EMC (EMC).

Shares of EMC, which hit the triple-digit mark in late 2000, plunged to
$11 a year later. But after reporting last week that fourth quarter
sales rose by 25 percent sequentially, shares of EMC have rebounded and
are now 50 percent higher than their October nadir. Speculation abounds
that the company, and the entire data storage sector, are poised for a
comeback.

Hello all, 

I think it is time for another moral booster.  There is a deal in Panorama for 3 nights accomodation (most of us will probably do 2 nights) and 2 full days of skiing for $179/person.  The accomodations are one bedroom condo's that sleep 4 people.  They have a fire place, kitchen and have full access to the Panorama hot springs. 
There are only 4 condo's available so we need to book tomorrow.  Please  speak to your signicant others, and buddies and reply to me ASAP in you are interested.  
The weekend will be March 1st, 2nd & 3rd.  

If there are more then 16 people interested there are hotels running similar deals that are right at the resort as well. 

Please let me know tomorrow morning if you are interested!

Can't wait to hear from you!!!

Subcategory: MISCELLANEOUS
Subject: 02-010 Clay Basin Shut-in & Testing

Notice Text:
All Shippers Letter 02-010
Date:	1/28/02
Hrs:	12:00

Notice to Northwest Pipeline Shippers
Questar Pipeline posted the following notice on January 23, 2002
regarding Clay Basin capacity holders.
Notice identifier 1400
_______________

NOTICE TO CLAY BASIN CAPACITY HOLDERS

As previously reported in October 2001, Questar Pipeline Company
is planning to perform inventory verification and deliverability
tests at its Clay Basin storage facility beginning April 2, 2002.
These tests will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for
reservoir gas inventory verification followed immediately by a
2-day field deliverability test. In an effort to allow our
shippers time to minimize the impact of the testing as much as
possible, we are providing the following information on the
planned testing.

During the 14-day shut in, from April 2, 2002 through April 15,
2002, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize their
storage service. Beginning at 8:00 a.m. on April 16, 2002 an
Operational Flow Order will be issued to facilitate the
deliverability flow test. During the 2-day flow test period, all
FSS capacity holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of
their withdrawal capacity based on their contracted percentage of
Clay Basin's total working gas storage capacity. No injections
will be allowed during the flow test.


The planned deliverability test will be conducted as follows:

During each test day, all storage customers will be required to
make a withdrawal and corresponding transportation nomination. The
volume of the required withdrawal nomination will be calculated as
follows:

April 16, 2002 allocation:
Customers Contracted Percentage of Working Capacity x 213 MDth =
Daily flow requirement *

April 17, 2002 allocation:
Customers Contracted Percentage of Working Capacity x 106.5 MDth =
Daily flow requirement *

Example: A storage customer holds annual FSS storage capacity of
1,065,000 Dth. Its minimum nomination would be calculated as
follows:

April 16 Flow Requirement: 1,065,000 Dth/54,581,250 Dth x 213,000
Dth = 4,156 Dth *

April 17 Flow Requirement: 1,065,000 Dth/54,581,250 Dth x 106,500
Dth = 2,078 Dth *



* Important Note: The flow rates and daily flow requirements above
are based on the minimum flow rates necessary to conduct the
deliverability test. Depending on conditions in the basin at the
time of the test, customers may be required to increase their
withdrawal rates by up to 25%. FSS capacity holders will be
required to have adequate inventory in Clay Basin and
transportation capacity to facilitate the flow test. If it is
necessary to cancel the deliverability test due to conditions
beyond Questar's reasonable ability to prevent or control, Questar
will notify customers of cancellation as soon as possible.

Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate
transportation of their gas supply and to mitigate the impact as
much as possible during the testing period. Please do not hesitate
to contact your Questar marketing or customer service
representative with any questions regarding the upcoming tests.
________________

Northwest Pipeline will assist its shippers in meeting the
flow requirements for the deliverability tests scheduled on
April 16 and 17. Northwest will notify customers as more
information becomes available.

Please contact your Marketing Services Representative for
assistance.

1. Beltway blues: Regulatory roadblocks loom for RBOCs
Hating Ma Bell has never gone out of style

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The slowing economy has been a boon for at least one segment of
the telecom world. The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs)
saw many smaller competitors go bankrupt in 2001, and their
purchasing costs fell as telecom equipment vendors were forced to
lower prices to win business. That left management of these firms
sitting in the catbird seat as we head into 2002.

But hold the phone. Washington appears set to deliver a series of
regulatory setbacks to RBOCS such as SBC Communications (SBC),
BellSouth (BLS), Qwest Communications (Q) and Verizon (VZ).

2. International wires: New euros resolutions
Three European telcos start the year with new ""buy"" ratings. But will
they stick?

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

After a lackluster 2001, the new year started off with a bang for
many European telcos. In the first week of 2002, a screen of those
with an average analyst rating of 2 (""buy"") or better reveals
three newcomers.

3. Buyout opportunities: Big fish, little fish
As growth in wireless slows, investment bankers may get busy

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

News that a few small wireless carriers just reported weak Q4
subscriber results may seem insignificant. But it should be viewed
as a defining moment for the next phase of the wireless industry:
consolidation. As growth slows, the larger carriers appear set to
gobble up the smaller carriers in a bid to maintain growth.

The industry's structure holds the key. Big carriers such as
Sprint PCS (PCS), Nextel Communications (NXTL) and AT&T Wireless (AWE)
have entered into agreements with 'affiliates.' These affiliates are
run by entrepreneurs that got the green light to raise capital and
launch service in areas not served by their bigger counterparts. For
example, Alamosa Holdings (APS), Ubiquitel (UPCS), and
Airgate PCS (PCSA) all operate in conjunction with national player
Sprint PCS. They benefit from a national marketing plan, and get
paid by the minute when callers roam into their territorial networks.

4. Beating the odds: Amid industry funk, satellite radio makes
dazzling debut Analysts expect near-term pullback, but like the
segment's potential

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Perhaps you missed it. Amid the turmoil and growing economic
uncertainty of late 2001, XM Satellite Radio (XMSR) completed one
of the most successful consumer electronic product launches in years.

The company completed the national rollout of its digital audio radio
service, which delivers digital quality radio to cars via satellite.
XMSR now offers 100 channels coast to coast for a fee of $9.99 per
month.

"Lay touted Enron stock to employees","January 14, 2002
Lay touted Enron stock to employees 
Growth 'has never been more certain,' former chairman of failed energy trader said in e-mails: Messages released
The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - In a pair of e-mails to his employees in August, the chairman of now-bankrupt Enron Corp. touted the company's stock and declared that the energy trader giant's growth ""has never been more certain.""
""Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust. ... We have the finest organization in American business today,"" Ken Lay said in an Aug. 14 e-mail just two months before Enron's long-hidden financial problems surfaced.
In an Aug. 27 e-mail, Mr. Lay announced the details of an employee stock option program that spoke of ""a significantly higher price"" for Enron stock in the future. Selling for US$37 a share in August, Enron stock now sells at US68?. The stock was at US$83 a year ago.
""It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron was prospering and that its stock price would rise,"" Rep. Henry Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, said in a letter Saturday to Mr. Lay.
Mr. Waxman released the e-mails along with the letter to Mr. Lay, whose political donations along with those of other Enron executives have made the company U.S. President George W. Bush's biggest financial supporter through two governor's races and the presidential election.
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said the picture for the company was solid in August and that financial problems didn't become clear until later.
""Ken Lay was telling the truth"" in August, said Mr. Palmer. ""We had had 21 consecutive quarters of earnings growth, the same number of consecutive quarters of volume growth. Our core business at Enron had never been in better shape.""
On Oct. 16, the company acknowledged hundreds of millions of dollars in third-quarter losses and a billion-dollar writedown of its equity, a belated admission that touched off a crisis in investor confidence and sent the company careening toward bankruptcy. The company for several years had kept huge amounts of debt off the company's books in partnerships that had been set up by Enron executives, who collected millions of dollars from the partnerships.
Declaring that Mr. Lay sold US$40-million of Enron stock between January and August last year, Mr. Waxman demanded to know whether Mr. Lay was aware of the company's financial vulnerabilities.
""If you were not aware of this, please explain whether this was because Jeffrey Skilling or other executives withheld that information from you,"" Mr. Waxman wrote. Mr. Skilling had abruptly left the company in August after just six months as president and CEO.
In one of the August e-mails to employees, Mr. Lay said he regretted Mr. Skilling's ""resignation. ... Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.""
Mr. Palmer said ""all of those partnerships had been through review processes and approval processes that were set up with and in many cases worked out with Arthur Andersen as our outside auditors, plus outside legal counsel.""
The Enron spokesman said problems with the partnerships were brought to light ""as the result of our investigation. We found there were accounting problems with one of those partnerships and we fixed that by restating those earnings and that was not knowledge we had in August.""

"You're MISSING OUT!  UP 69% already!","As a valued member of the INVESTools community, you've
asked to be notified about new investment tools, features,
and money-saving opportunities from INVESTools and our
strategic partners.  We think you'll be interested in this
exciting offer from Phillips Publishing Inc.

To unsubscribe, see the link at the end of this email.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Investor,

So far you've missed 69% gains.  Wait any longer, and you'll miss the
best shot at a ten-bagger you'll ever get!

A while back I wrote to you about what I call ""the biggest lie in
technology today""...

...and offered you a FREE bulletin on the ONE stock best positioned for
enormous gains, as this story unfolds.  A stock that could easily DOUBLE
your money in short order...and then make your fortune several times
over in the next few years.

To me, it's CRAZY that I haven't heard back from you.  After all, this
is an entirely FREE piece of information--with no obligation on your
part.  You have nothing to lose.  And--judging by our gains so far--a
pile of money to make.

Since I started pounding the table for this stock after the September
crisis, it's UP 69%!  But DON'T WORRY.  There's still time to get in on
the lion's share of the gains.  The really BIG PROFITS--3 or 4-times
what we've made so far--will come as the economy recovers this year.
And that's why the perfect time to buy this POWERHOUSE company is NOW.

IN JUST A MOMENT, I'll tell you how to get the name of this stock,
complete details and my full ""buy instructions""--absolutely FREE,
without obligation of any kind.

But first, it's imperative that you know the truth about technology's
biggest lie: The so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic cable.

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down--very
noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came to a grinding halt!
That means there isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the
system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem.
After all, this is the second time it's happened.  Back in July, a
tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems--and therefore our economy--are
very, very vulnerable.  And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than
99.9% of Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest--one of America's biggest carriers--recently said they're 60%
loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound too bad...until you
understand how these networks operate.  You can't load a network much
past 65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic--because the network
spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes to a
standstill.  And business, the economy and our national security all go
in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a ""fiber glut?""  Because
 95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is ""dark""--that is, it's
not activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1 supplier of
the components needed to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE--possibly
a TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our
money five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly has
""ten-bagger"" potential!

So get in on the action.  Click on the link below to get the name of
this stock--This TOP PICK is absolutely FREE and without obligation, but
only for a limited time.  It's my way of introducing you to my
award-winning Technology Investing advisory--but there's no obligation
of any kind.

I think you'll find this FREE offer well worth your while.  In 1999--the
last time tech stocks started from such depressed levels--my clients
earned 157%, as verified by The Hulbert Financial Digest.  And that
earned us Hulbert's #1 RANKING for all investment advisories!

So far, we've made 69% in this fiber-optics POWERHOUSE since
mid-September.  You've missed out so far.  Don't miss out on the much
BIGGER GAINS to come,

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly 20-times
higher.  But then the economy tanked and spending on communications
networks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in
emergency spending into the economy; interest rates are practically
zero; and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore--it's a
question of NATIONAL SECURITY!  That's why this next move up will be so
powerful.

Please don't miss out.

You've got nothing to lose by taking advantage of this FREE--no strings
attached--introductory offer.  Click here to sign up now:

http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0ML232

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.  This
""ten-bagger"" has a long ways to run--but it's already UP 69% since
mid-September, in recognition of this company's vital new role in
national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained to the
limits.  And get this--data traffic is DOUBLING every year now.  That
means a network running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the fiber must be lit.
That's why the fiber will be lit.  Click here to take advantage of this
FREE opportunity now.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
FASten your seatbelts
New accounting rules and political infighting will make for a bumpy ride
ahead

by Rick Wayman, CFA

This is going to be an interesting quarter, if not year! The stock market is
advancing like it expects a recovery in the first half of 2002, and
politicians have reverted to their pre-9/11 partisanship. Coupled with the
new accounting rules for goodwill amortization (FAS 142), this could
make for a volatile stock market in the first quarter.

The market appears ahead of itself, and there is more downside risk than
upside potential. Stocks have rallied significantly from the 9/11 lows, but
we are really only back to where we were pre-9/11. The easy money has
been made, and now economic reality poses a threat. We think the
positive economic data that was released last month will be replaced with
negative trends in the first part of 2002. This is because the discounting
that boosted sales in December stole activity from the first part of 2002.
Consequently, we expect 4Q01 profit margins (to be reported in the first
quarter of 2002) to shrink, and early 2002 sales data to show a decline.

Regulatory roadblocks loom for RBOCs
Hating Ma Bell has never gone out of style

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The slowing economy has been a boon for at least one segment of the
telecom world. The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) saw
many smaller competitors go bankrupt in 2001, and their purchasing
costs fell as telecom equipment vendors were forced to lower prices to
win business. That left management of these firms sitting in the catbird
seat as we head into 2002.

But hold the phone. Washington appears set to deliver a series of
regulatory setbacks to RBOCS such as SBC Communications (SBC),
BellSouth (BLS), Qwest Communications (Q) and Verizon (VZ).

"Enron Canada 'critical' to auction in U.S.","January 11, 2002
Enron Canada 'critical' to auction in U.S. 
Unit remains solvent: Part of package to sell trading business, Milnthorp says
Claudia Cattaneo, Calgary Bureau Chief 
Financial Post; with files from Bloomberg News 
CALGARY - Enron Canada Corp. cut half its staff and halted its trading operations while waiting for an auction in the United States that could yield a buyer today for Enron's trading business, the president and chief executive of the Canadian unit said yesterday.
Robson Milnthorp said the Canadian arm will be ""critical"" to a deal to sell Enron Corp.'s trading business because it has been the most profitable in the company.
The unit remains solvent, with more than $220-million in cash and more than $100-million owed by counterparties -- partners with whom it has contracts -- that are refusing to honour their obligations, he said in an interview.
If there's no bid for the Canadian operation, Enron Canada will look for a white knight of its own, he said.
""We have been very careful not to jeopardize the efforts made on Houston's part with respect to the [auction]. But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time.""
Houston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.
In Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.
Enron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.
Enron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a ""significant but undetermined"" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.
Mr. Milnthorp said the investigation ""has nothing to do with Enron Canada.""
The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.
Mr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called ""Netco,"" short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.
Mr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.
""To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process,"" he said.
Enron Canada's remaining employees are ""trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid,"" he said.
The unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.
Bidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.

"Enron probe could reach Bush","January 3, 2002
Enron probe could reach Bush 
Backed campaign: Senate committee to focus on directors' role, partnerships
Reuters, with files from The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - Fallen energy giant Enron Corp. faces further scrutiny on Capitol Hill with another committee announcing yesterday it would probe the company's collapse, possibly looking at connections between Enron and the White House.
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent subcommittee on investigations will subpoena documents next week and hold a hearing on Jan. 24.
A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover by rival Dynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's murky finances.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who chairs the full government affairs committee, did not rule out looking into connections between Enron and the administration of George W. Bush.
Enron was a major backer of President Bush's election campaign. ""There are some interconnections here with the Bush administration, but that is not the focus of this investigation,"" said Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat.
Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, said the investigation would focus on the role of Enron's directors in the collapse; accounting firm Andersen, which audited Enron's financial statements; and the company's use of complex financial partnerships.
Houston-based Enron is under investigation in Washington by at least five congressional committees, the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission and the departments of Justice and Labor.
Reports recently emerged that a week before filing for bankruptcy protection, Enron contributed US$100,000 to Democrats after giving nearly all its prior donations this year to Republicans.
The money went to the organization that aids Senate Democratic candidates, but a recently hired attorney for Enron insisted the donations were unrelated to congressional investigations.
Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented former president Bill Clinton and other high-profile clients, said the money was pledged months before Enron's collapse prompted the congressional inquiries. Rather, he said, the shift reflected the Democrats taking control of the Senate this year.
""Donations of this type reflect certain political realities which are followed by all major corporations,"" Mr. Bennett said yesterday about Enron's US$50,000 cheques on Nov. 25 and Nov. 26 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies, Enron's stock closed at US63?, up US3? on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday -- off from an August, 2000, high of US$90.56.
Thousands of Enron employees have lost their jobs and much of their retirement savings. A 401(k) retirement plan that made many of them heavily dependent on company stock came under fire at a congressional hearing last month when employees said they were unable to sell their holdings when the stock price plunged.
In other developments yesterday, Enron bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzalez put off ruling on whether to compel Jeffrey McMahon, Enron chief financial officer, to testify about why the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in New York rather than Houston.
Dynegy and other unsecured creditors want Mr. McMahon to give deposition testimony on Enron's choice of venue for the bankruptcy filing. They've asked Judge Gonzalez to transfer the largest bankruptcy case ever to Houston, where Enron is based.
Enron opposes the request to order Mr. McMahon's testimony, calling it ""unnecessary, unduly burdensome, and disruptive.""
""Courts have repeatedly recognized that demands for depositions of high-ranking corporate officers are often misused as a tool of harassment and should not be allowed unless there is no other source for the same information,"" Enron said in a motion filed Monday seeking to quash the request.

"MIRANT","hey,

I think if you maybe want to start working the termination value as of Dec 22 (which is a Saturday), using ROM quotes and the rest of the mids, I will work on Nov30, and Dec1-21 phys penalties.

 Chelsea printed out   
I:\Canadian Energy Services\Estate\Dorland-Watt\Forwards Detail-MIRANT_JAN17.xls
    and I have the file
I:\Canadian Energy Services\Estate\Dorland-Watt\Mirant deals - typed from confirms.xls

This second file has a confirmed volumes for December (ie the market and supply we cut exactly matches what actually happened - good thing). There is probably some overlap with this file and the one Chelsea printed. Hers prints each deal by month though, which sucks. Take a look at both and see what you think.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Sucker's rally
Fool you twice, shame on you

By Dave Sterman, equity research analyst

In recent months, investors have returned to their speculative ways,
bidding up share prices in companies that still face challenging outlooks
to say the least. With signs emerging that the economic recovery will be
tepid at best, these investors may want to proceed with caution. Indeed,
some of the biggest gainers in recent months may be the most vulnerable
to a pullback, especially those for which the company-specific outlook
has yet to brighten.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Biotech rules
Biotechnology stocks point investors to a holy grail

By Michael Hickins, managing editor

On one level, it makes perfect sense for investors and analysts to favor
biotechnology stocks as much as they do: everyone wants to live forever,
and in relative physical comfort. Biotechnology offers the promise of a
rational (as opposed to mythical) Fountain of Youth, a picture of Dorian
Gray that never ages.

Moreover, biotechnology offers the potential to generate immortal
returns. Indeed, historical returns for the sector have been very
encouraging. According to analysts at U.S. Warburg, the industry has
been able to grow its collective top line by 18 percent since 1996. And
during the past 20-plus years, also according to the firm, the industry has
produced more than 100 drugs (using a wide definition of ""biotech
drug""), ""that currently generate annual revenues of roughly $12.5
billion.""

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. B2B insights: B is for ""bubble""
Supply chain software stocks surge--but why?

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

It's dj vu all over again, as stocks of supply chain
software vendors i2 Technologies (ITWO), Manugistics (MANU),
and SAP (SAP), among others, have climbed sharply in recent
months. These stocks were among the highest flyers at the
height of the Internet bubble, and it's fair to wonder if
investors are slipping back into that old bugaboo,
irrational exuberance.

The surge in prices is based on a fairly dubious investment
thesis: sales are no longer falling and the worst may be
over. But sales are not yet rising either. And analysts are
compelled to look several years out to justify current stock
prices.

Make no mistake--supply chain software is an essential part
of corporate IT strategy. Companies are looking to port much
of their operations onto the Internet so that they can
communicate and transact with vendors in an automated
fashion. Supply chain software links clients and vendors
onto a single platform so they can peek into production
schedules and adjust inventories accordingly.

2. The real deal: The long and the short
Economic factors that will impact the market and investors--and vice versa

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

Last year capped the worst two-year stock tumble since 1973-
1974, and effectively eliminated all the hype and hope that
mobilized individual investors during the late 1990s.
(Although it is unlikely that the individuals who remain in
the market continue to expect the returns of yesteryear,
investors probably still expect too much from the broad
market.)

Today, investors are understandably concerned about the
market, and are leery of chasing stocks. However, there will
be a time during the year when you've just missed the boat
(as most missed it last year). And I'm just as sure that
something will test the resolve of the market--an event or
series of events that will send stocks tumbling.

However, I think it is a big mistake for investors to wait
for it, or to wait for some type of testing of the bottom.
By the same token, however, I think it is still important to
take profits and maybe be a little more flexible with stops.
I suspect that after two years of depression, this market
will still suffer from bouts of mental instability. Let
those bi-polar moments work for you. There are tons of funds
on the sidelines waiting to chase this market. Keep a steady
head, don't panic, and stop worrying about the worse case
scenarios. Fundamental change cannot happen until we see a
change of mind among investors.

Below are my thoughts on leading economic indicators, market
trends, my picks of the year , and some sector ideas.

4. New coverage: Looking for security
The IT security market still looks good, but an attractive market brings on more competition.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

Though many companies in the technology sector are
confronted with crises in valuations and expectations, those
focused on IT security have great promise for growth. The
volume of Internet transactions continues to rise, making it
essential for companies to maintain a secure space in which
this business can be conducted. The fallout from recent
high-profile computer viruses has hammered this point home.
Now recent reports are projecting a sizeable increase in the
demand for IT security solutions.

From its recent survey on IT security, J.P. Morgan found
that companies expect to spend 10.3 percent of their IT
budgets on security next year, compared with 7.4 percent for
this year. With IT budgets expected to expand by 2.7
percent, the firm figures that IT security spending will
grow 43 percent.

5. B2B insights: Europe: E-business leader?
How do results from SAP (SAP) reflect world markets for e-business applications?

its preliminary announcement of strong fourth quarter
software license sales. Revenues for the quarter were
expected to exceed 1 billion euro, contributing to SAP's

"","UBS, Enron Plan Quick Moves on Deal
Swiss Bank, Enron To Seek Approval of Deal From FTC, Justice Department Within Five Business Days
By ALAN CLENDENNING 
AP Business Writer 
NEW YORK (AP) -- Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) will give up its crown jewel energy trading business to a Swiss investment bank in return for a third of the division's profits, and experts expect the bank will try to remake the division with a new name and management.
	
Documents filed in bankruptcy court Tuesday show that UBS Warburg, a division of Switzerland's largest bank, won't pay anything upfront to acquire the trading operation or assume any Enron debt. 
Traders and other employees deemed crucial to the division's success will be kept on, but the documents didn't specify whether top Enron managers are among the group of workers that will be asked to stay. 
Some of those employees will be awarded bonuses from an $11 million fund as an incentive to stay with the company, and Enron will supply $6 million of the cash, according to the documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
A spokesman for Enron didn't immediately return a telephone message seeking comment about Enron's future or the future of the trading operation. UBS Warburg spokesman David Walker said his firm would not comment until after Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez decides whether to approve the deal. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. 
Key among the changes UBS Warburg will probably make are a name change for the trading operation, a decision to show top managers the door, and the effort to retain the traders, said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. 
``I think those people will stay and they'll have a new boss,'' he said. ``As for top management, almost everybody is a liability now.'' 
Enron officials have said that about 800 of the division's workers will be asked to stay on at offices in Houston, and court documents indicated that UBS Warburg also wants to take over the division's offices in Portland, Ore., Toronto and Calgary, Alberta. 
Enron itself will become a much smaller company because it received 90 percent of its revenue from the trading operation, and creditors are likely to demand the sale of other assets. 
But the nature of the profit-sharing agreement between Enron and UBS Warburg gives Enron an opportunity to attempt to rebuild, said Charlie Sanchez, energy markets manager for Gelber & Associates in Houston. 
Under terms of the deal, Enron and its creditors will initially get 33 percent of the new business' pretax profits and UBS Warburg the remainder, the documents said. 
After three years, UBS Warburg can begin to buy out some of those profit-sharing rights and eventually buy the rights to all of the profits. And after five years, UBS can sell the business. 
``It all seems very much like an attempt at least to keep a string of hope alive that UBS won't in fact won't be interested in purchasing them and they will accumulate enough proceeds to revive themselves, that they can become a rebranded phoenix,'' Sanchez said. 
And in a statement, a top Enron official made it clear that the company hopes to eventually emerge from bankruptcy protection as a viable business concern. 
``This is an extremely positive deal for Enron and its creditors that confirms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation,'' said Enron chief financial officer Jeff McMahon. ``We believe this is a first step among many towards an overall plan of reorganization and planned emergence from bankruptcy.'' 
UBS Warburg and Enron will file for approval of the deal with the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department within five business days. 
Hours after the documents explaining terms of the deal were filed in court, the New York Stock Exchange delisted Enron stock, which sold for $83 a year ago but have changed hands at no higher than $1 since December. In a statement, the exchange said Enron's ``securities are no longer suitable for trading on the NYSE.'' 
The move was ``due to the expected protracted nature of the company's bankruptcy process and the uncertainty at this time as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on the company's common shareholders,'' the NYSE said. 
Enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships used to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial problems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading business. 
A creditors' committee supports the deal with UBS Warburg, but other Enron creditors have questioned it, saying they want more information about how the agreement was reached and how the proceeds will be allocated. 
Some two dozen Enron creditors had already filed objections to the sale before the selection was announced. Dissatisfied creditors will have 10 days to appeal Gonzalez's ruling. 
The deal does not include existing contracts Enron has to supply power, valued at between $6 billion and $7 billion. 
Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy merchant and the nation's seventh largest company by revenue. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the sun -- advertising space, broadband, paper, the weather and more than 1,000 other products. 
U.S.-traded shares of UBS AG fell 31 cents to close at $48.90 Tuesday on the NYSE.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Institutional ownership
This screen always seemed good in principle, and it's looking good
in fact

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

The real mystery here is why the screen struggled in the past. Its
parameters seem logical enough. The primary theme is that the stock
be under-owned by institutions (a percentage ownership that is lower
than the industry average percent), yet not hopelessly obscure
(coverage by at least two analysts is required as is a minimal
institutional ownership threshold of 10 percent) and a trend toward
improving ownership by the big guys. These primary trends are supported
by tests requiring a decline in short interest, insider buying, and
strong recent relative share price performance.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The new digital divide
Most Americans are now online, but they are still
divided by speed

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

The famed FBI criminal profiling unit would have its work cut out if was
on the lookout for a criminal today whose only known characteristic was
that he is a regular US Internet user. With the widespread adoption of the
Internet in the US, the demographic characteristics of the average US
Internet user today so closely match those of the wider population that
there are very few distinguishing features between the two.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Lost illusions
Wall Street's coming-of-age of investment theory

The real world doesn't always behave as expected. Law school graduates
are familiar with the expression which says, ""'A' students become judges.
'B' Students become lawyers. 'C' students become rich.""

The same could be said of the investment field.

Indeed, people in every walk of life have their own stories about how the
real-world methods of functioning often fail to follow theoretical ideas
about the way things ought to be done.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Top picks for 2002
Winning stocks will be switch-hitters and versatile utility players

By Robert Maltbie, Jr., CFA

Flexibility and style diversification will be key in 2002.  Given that
we expect major market averages to fluctuate by plus or minus
10%, stocks that beat those averages will have to offer a great deal
of weapons. Therefore, we are focusing on 10 stocks that we
believe will thrive across a broad range of styles, including growth,
value, and international. To smash the averages this year, we have
selected growth stocks that have outstanding earnings visibility and
dominant market positions, and value stocks with top, highly
disciplined management teams. We also offer investors a couple of
short ideas where heavy debt loads and technological obsolesce
will be too onerous to allow them to succeed.

		<p>The real world doesn't always behave as expected. Law school graduates
are familiar with the expression which says, ""'A' students become judges.
'B' Students become lawyers. 'C' students become rich.""</p>

<p>The same could be said of the investment field.</p>

<p>Indeed, people in every walk of life have their own stories about how the
real-world methods of functioning often fail to follow theoretical ideas
about the way things ought to be done.

<p>Flexibility and style diversification will be key in 2002.  Given that
we expect major market averages to fluctuate by plus or minus
10%, stocks that beat those averages will have to offer a great deal
of weapons. Therefore, we are focusing on 10 stocks that we
believe will thrive across a broad range of styles, including growth,
value, and international. To smash the averages this year, we have
selected growth stocks that have outstanding earnings visibility and
dominant market positions, and value stocks with top, highly
disciplined management teams. We also offer investors a couple of
short ideas where heavy debt loads and technological obsolesce
will be too onerous to allow them to succeed.

"January 28, 2002 - The bright side","
In today's edition of the Daily Update, we look at the silver linings
for telecom equipment stocks and even Enron. Indeed, where the latter
is concerned, eMarketer senior analyst Steve Butler explains how Enron's
online trading platform changed the energy trading landscape and
created opportunities that would not have otherwise existed. Also,
frequent contributor John Filar Atwood discusses three telecom
equipment stocks with brighter outlooks than expected.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The EnronOnline diaspora
Online energy trading has been orphaned, not aborted

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Although the company is now defunct, and while its behavior has taken a
serious financial toll on many individuals and companies, Enron's legacy
also includes its role as an Internet trailblazer. Indeed, by its sheer size
and ambition, the company was able to change the way that its
competitors traded, permanently and significantly altering both the
energy sector and the Internet.

To get an idea of the magnitude of what we're dealing with, according to
company data, Enron's (ENE) Internet-based trading exchange,
EnronOnline, was processing about 4,000 transactions per day
worldwide, with an average deal size of about $500,000, by September
of 2001. At an annualized rate, the notional value of online transaction
activity conducted through EnronOnline was approximately $510 billion--
a healthy increase from the $101 billion in transactions during 2000.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Analysts see brighter earnings picture for three equipment companies
In an uncertain market, analysts seem sure about the earnings potential of
these companies

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The reduction in capital spending by major carriers has weighed on telecom
equipment stock performance in recent months, and threatens to do so
throughout 2002. The consensus estimate now appears to be a 26 percent
drop in carrier capital expenditures in 2002 resulting in a 23 percent
decline in aggregate revenues for the equipment group.

Subject:How to explain Enron  to your children (or grandchildren)
 
Some  things have to be shared.
Feudalism - You have  two cows. Your lord takes some of the  milk.
Fascism - You have two cows. The government  takes both, hires you to
take care of them, and sells you the  milk.
Communism - You have two cows. Your  neighbors help take care of them and
you share the  milk.
Totalitarianism - You have two cows. The  government takes them both,
denies they ever existed and drafts you into the  army. Milk is banned.
Capitalism - You have two  cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd
multiplies, and the economy  grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.
Enron  Venture Capitalism - You have two cows. You sell three of them  to
your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by  your
brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an  associated general
offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax  exemption for five cows.
The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via  an intermediary to a
Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority  shareholder who sells the
rights to all seven cows back to your listed  company. The annual report says
the company owns eight cows, with an option  on one more.

1. Pro forma profits: Hell freezes over (on a pro forma basis)
Could Amazon be pulling an Enron?

By Rick Wayman, CFA

I always thought that hell would freeze over before Amazon.com (AMZN)
posted a profit. This company, and the market's love affair with it, has
always amazed me. After all, how could a market (even an irrational one)
price this stock near $120 at a time when it was losing $0.44 on every
dollar of sales, which is what happened in 1999?

Ever since Jeff Bezos, the Prince of Pro Forma, announced that AMZN
would post a profit by the end of 2001, I eagerly awaited the release so
I could see how, not if, he would concoct the desired result.

I was not disappointed.

2. B2B insights: Strategic sourcing
Streamlined processes and lower costs create new investment opportunities

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

B2B e-commerce stocks suffered from highly publicized plummets during
the last two years, placing weaker players in jeopardy, but since
September this group has seen an impressive run-up in the shares of some
stocks. Far from being on the verge of extinction, it's a sector with
multi-trillion-dollar potential, a piece of which many vendors are
trying to grab.

3. Insider selling: Sucker's rally
Fool you twice, shame on you

By Dave Sterman, equity research analyst

In recent months, investors have returned to their speculative ways,
bidding up share prices in companies that still face challenging
outlooks to say the least. With signs emerging that the economic
recovery will be tepid at best, these investors may want to proceed with
caution. Indeed, some of the biggest gainers in recent months may be the
most vulnerable to a pullback, especially those for which the company-
specific outlook has yet to brighten.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
E-commerce comes out from under the shadows
Companies used to be reluctant to discuss Internet sales, but are now
breaking the silence

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

Until recently, many companies were reluctant to discuss e-commerce
because they did not want to share their strategies with competitors.
Today, however, companies announce e-business initiatives to show that
they are in tune with the times and prepared to face tough competition in
the future.

By comparing a company's e-commerce activity to that of its competitors,
shareholders may gain insight into how well management has grasped
the main issues of e-business, developed an integrated technology
strategy, and executed its vision.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Can eBay give investors an encore?
The company is confident that it can maintain super-fast growth, and
analysts agree.

by Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The economic landscape is littered with the carcasses of dot-coms that
tried but failed. Only one firm can say that it consistently delivered on its
initial growth metrics: eBay (EBAY). In 1998, when the online auction
company went public, it was set to bag some $86 million in revenue.
Three years later, that figure has exploded to $749 million, and operating
profits have risen thirteen-fold.

With shares of eBay trading at lofty heights, investors are clearly
expecting more strong growth to come. Can eBay deliver? The answer,
according to those who analyze the company, is a resounding ""yes.""

"Porsche quote","
Hello Chris,

As per our conversation, I checked out some prices on the 1989 Porsche
911.  Right now the price for 1,000,000 liability, collision $1000
deductible, comprehensive $500 deductible would be about $1300 for six
months.  Your renewal is coming up in April and it looks as though your
rates would come down on this vehicle by $400. (The premiums on your
Jeep will also be coming down on renewal)  If you buy the vehicle and
just want to put fire, theft vandalism etc.. until spring, the cost is
about $280 for six months.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact
me by e-mail or by phone at 1-800-897-5074.

Yours truly,

Kim D'Onofrio

"Amish Girls","Those Amish Girls

An Amish woman and her daughter were riding in an old buggy one cold blustery day. The daughter said to her mother, ""My hands are freezing cold.""

The mother replied, ""Put them between your legs. Your body heat will warm them up."" So the daughter did and her hands warmed up.

The next day the daughter was riding with her boy friend and he said ""My hands are freezing cold."" The girl replied, ""Put them between my legs.
The warmth of my body will warm them up."" So he did and warmed his hands.

The following day the boyfriend was again in the buggy with the daughter.
He said ""My nose is cold."" The girl replied ""Put it between my legs.
The warmth of my body will warm it up."" So he did and warmed his nose.

The next day the boyfriend was again driving with the daughter and he said, ""My penis is frozen solid.""

The following day the daughter was driving in the buggy with her mother, and she says to her mother, ""Have you ever heard of a penis?""

Slightly concerned the mother said, ""Why, yes. Why do you ask?"" The daughter replies ""Well they make one hell of a mess when they defrost, don't they?""

1. INVESTMENTOR
Prophetic to pathetic: a year in review
Flagellation and self-congratulation with the benefit of hindsight

By William Valentine, CFA

I'm a corny, traditional kind of guy, especially around the holidays.
Whether it's felling the family Christmas tree in the nearby forest,
enjoying thrice-daily eggnog lattes, or experimenting with a new
pheasant recipe each year, you could almanac my predictability.

This is also the time of year that I lay out my goals, personally and
professionally, for the coming year--which you can't do until you
examine the successes and failures of the prior year. And as long team
readers know, that manifests itself in the form of my third annual
""Prophetic to Pathetic"" Review of all columns written, and advice given,
over the last year.

Forty-two columns are a lot to review. But I didn't have to look too far to
find blunders, miscues, and downright pathetic commentary. Going back
to my ""2001 Outlook"" from last January, in hindsight I was too
optimistic about the economy and market. For the first half of the year, I
believed that we'd actually skirt an official recession. While we'll never
know whether or not we would have avoided one without the impact of
Sept. 11th, we clearly did enter into a recession, and that kept the stock
market's growth retarded.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Five fateful days
Five January days that could determine the course of the year, and four
picks from the guru

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

After a two-year route that saw the market experience it's worse
performance since 1973-74, investors are going to begin the year hoping
for the best but not forcing the issue. Reluctance to buy this market could
result in a lackluster first week.

The old saying is that as January goes, so goes the rest of the year (in fact
traditionalists say the first five days of the year will determine the
outcome for the rest of the year). I'm not so sure that will be applicable
to the market this year.

Instead, it could be the last 5 days of the month that sets the tone for the
rest of the year. On the 29th, the Fed gathers for the first FOMC meeting
of the year. After 11 rate cuts last year, it will be interesting to see
whether Greenspan and company decide to take the scalpel to rates
again. We think the market has a better chance of making a serious rally
if the Fed chooses to stand pat.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Be careful what you ask for
Getting on with our lives and with our investments

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

So I guess you can handle the truth. During the course of the past week,
I received a tsunami of mail, the vast majority ripping me for justifying
everything that's wrong with Corporate America. Ironically, both the right
and the left saw fault with the premise that I suggested--that investors
may not really want to know the truth.

A few investors admitted that they were afraid of opening a Pandora's
box, or that the revelation that the foundation of our financial system is
built on a lie would cause a financial Diaspora. I do believe that
assuming the worst is not only presumptuous, but probably jumping to
the wrong conclusion.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Rising subscriber turnover hurts PCS affiliates
Sprint's tougher stance on low credit customers is key factor

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Sprint PCS (PCS) has decided to get tough with certain low credit
customers. To date, the group getting punished by that decision is not the
customers, but Sprint's own regional affiliates.

The move has increased subscriber turnover, thereby lowering net
customer additions for the likes of AirGate PCS (PCSA), Alamosa PCS
(APS) and US Unwired (UNWR). It also has fed investors' perception that
there's no growth in sight for wireless stocks.

a latter-day Lazarus of the Internet--we're speaking, of course, of
Covad (COVD), which has reemerged from the ashes of DSL.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The most recommended stocks on Wall Street
Several micro-to-small cap stocks land on Wall Street's
most-recommended list

By Thomas J. Ryan, equity research columnist

With prospects for many of Wall Street's bellwethers still questionable,
analysts are looking for more sure-fire bets among the market's micro-
and-small cap stocks.
Indeed, small-cap stocks dominate a recent MultexNet screening of the
top ten most recommended stocks--with capitalization ranging from as
low as $150 million for LendingTree (TREE) to $900 million for 1-800-
Flowers (FLWS). The only clear large-cap stock to make the grade is
Gemstar TV Guide International (GMST), which has an $8.3 billion
valuation.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Covad is back from the dead
The company's rebirth is miraculous. But there's a problem:
No one knows if it can still make money.

By Dave Sterman, equity research analyst

The demise of NorthPoint Communications, Rhythms NetConnections,
and Covad Communications (COVD) in 2001 seemed to spell the end
of the data local exchange carrier (DLEC) sector. Investors were left to
conclude that the DSL industry would now reside squarely in the hands
of the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs), such as Verizon
(VZ), SBC (SBC), Qwest (Q), and BellSouth (BLS).

But to the surprise of many, one DLEC, Covad, has emerged from the
ashes to fight another day. At least one analyst thinks the company is
poised to get it right this time.

3. TRANSCRIPTS
On Tuesday, Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist with Ehrenkrantz,
King, Nussbaum, participated in a live Q&A session with investors on the
site. Here is some of what he had to say:

Question: Does ""valuation"" need to be redefined in this market?

Barry Hyman: If one considers September 11 as a turning point for the
world, then valuation must reflect the increased risk created by
terrorism.....Yet, I believe we have to look at the future earnings potential
rather than current earnings to be excited about the market's prospects
for this year and beyond. The rally we have seen from late September
only reflects the decreased risk of lowered earnings, and does not even
represent any growth story.

"Thursday Draw","Okay, we have the first draw for the loot thursday. The decision hasn't been made regarding what is up for grabs, but all the stuff's pretty nice as you know.

To make things clear, to qualify for the draw you must put in my hands a completed file folder with an initialled checklist on the front and a signed release form inside. Some completed folders can be found on the desk beside Jason Biever - Invasion is a good example of a completed folder.

It should also be noted that we always need a signed release form before we send out a cheque. Any issues counterparties have with that should be directed to Kyle.

If you should so require, Angela or Megan can put together a blank folder for you to fill in. We're not picky how you put the folder together, just that all of the following is inside (if applicable):
Confirms / TAGGs
Invoices / Payments
Correspondence
Model Calcs
Signed Release Form

Just send either of the two you counterparty name and they can set you up with a folder.

If you have any questions, let me know. Also, if you have a completed file without a release (i.e. if it's a reinstated contract which is flowing to termination like Domtar) tell me and I will make sure that management makes a decision on whether it qualifies.

I'll email the contenders out tomorrow around noon so if you think you are being sadly overlooked you can let me know then.

Good luck,

Mike

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Analysts predict solid 2002 for cable TV stocks
Consolidation and EBITDA growth will be the year's major themes

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Investors relying on cable television stocks as a defensive investment were
disappointed in 2001, as the group fell by about 20 percent, compared with
the a drop of ""just"" 13 percent for the S&P 500. But investors who now
abandon the industry may find themselves even more disappointed in 2002.

Analysts are projecting a strong year for cable companies, predicting
revenue growth of 13 percent and EBITDA growth of 14 percent. They also
believe most of the stocks are more fairly valued heading into 2002 than
they were at the outset of last year, when a late-2000 runup left them
overpriced.

Adding to analysts' enthusiasm is the recent completion of Comcast's
(CMCSK) purchase of AT&T's (T) broadband unit. The merger
underscores the value of broadband and its ability to offer voice, data and
video over the same pipe.

E-commerce across platforms--PC wins hands down
Wireless platforms have a role to play, but not in nailing sales

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Much has been made of the potential for e-commerce on mobile devices
and TV, but two leading research firms, Gartner and Forrester, predict
that in both Europe and the US, the PC will be the platform of choice for
e-commerce.

Gartner forecasts that by 2005, 72.6 percent of the US population will
access the Internet via PC, compared to 37 percent through an Internet
phone, and 16.5 percent through TV. They add that 42 percent of US e-
commerce buyers will regularly use multiple platforms.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Hell freezes over (on a pro forma basis)
Could Amazon be pulling an Enron?

By Rick Wayman, CFA

I always thought that hell would freeze over before Amazon.com (AMZN)
posted a profit. This company, and the market's love affair with it, has
always amazed me. After all, how could a market (even an irrational one)
price this stock near $120 at a time when it was losing $0.44 on every
dollar of sales, which is what happened in 1999?

Ever since Jeff Bezos, the Prince of Pro Forma, announced that AMZN
would post a profit by the end of 2001, I eagerly awaited the release so I
could see how, not if, he would concoct the desired result.

I was not disappointed.

Consolidation and content
Wireless semiconductor stocks wrestle for share of a shrinking market

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

As we saw in the IPO market in recent years, fast-growing industries
attracted a number of new players. But now that those industries have
matured, growth has slowed and many smaller players are looking to
merge in order to compete against the top tier players. As we noted a
few weeks ago, wireless service providers in particular look set to
engage in a merger orgy.

It now appears that the same could be said for the wireless
semiconductor industry. As growth in wireless handset sales has slowed,
chip vendors are also looking to march down the aisle. In mid-December,
Alpha Industries (AHAA) and Conexant (CNXT) announced plans to
merge their wireless chip divisions.

And more deals may emerge in the months to come. ""We wouldn't be
surprised to see additional activity as companies work to reach critical
mass at a much higher level than in the past,"" says CIBC's Dale Pfau.
Many players added factory capacity just as the industry slowed.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Looking for security
The IT security market still looks good, but an attractive market brings
on more competition.

By Shannon Swingle, contributing editor

Though many companies in the technology sector are confronted with
crises in valuations and expectations, those focused on IT security have
great promise for growth. The volume of Internet transactions continues
to rise, making it essential for companies to maintain a secure space in
which this business can be conducted. The fallout from recent high-
profile computer viruses has hammered this point home. Now recent
reports are projecting a sizeable increase in the demand for IT security
solutions.

From its recent survey on IT security, J.P. Morgan found that companies
expect to spend 10.3 percent of their IT budgets on security next year,
compared with 7.4 percent for this year. With IT budgets expected to
expand by 2.7 percent, the firm figures that IT security spending will
grow 43 percent.

Big fish, little fish
As growth in wireless slows, investment bankers may get busy

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

News that a few small wireless carriers just reported weak Q4 subscriber
results may seem insignificant. But it should be viewed as a defining
moment for the next phase of the wireless industry: consolidation. As
growth slows, the larger carriers appear set to gobble up the smaller
carriers in a bid to maintain growth.

The industry's structure holds the key. Big carriers such as Sprint PCS
(PCS), Nextel Communications (NXTL) and AT&T Wireless (AWE)
have entered into agreements with 'affiliates.' These affiliates are run by
entrepreneurs that got the green light to raise capital and launch service
in areas not served by their bigger counterparts. For example, Alamosa
Holdings (APS), Ubiquitel (UPCS), and Airgate PCS (PCSA) all
operate in conjunction with national player Sprint PCS. They benefit
from a national marketing plan, and get paid by the minute when callers
roam into their territorial networks.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Homeland defense may be catalyst for troubled wireless companies
Wireless stocks have tumbled in 2002, but $10 billion in national security
spending offers some long-term hope

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The news just keeps getting worse for wireless stocks. They have fallen
for three straight weeks amid reports from Verizon (VZ) and others that
subscriber growth is much slower than expected due to the struggling
economy.

The downward spiral continued after a few analysts recently downgraded
the entire sector. Without any positive developments to cling to, investor
pessimism appears to be feeding on itself. So far in 2002, the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange's wireless telecom index is off by 7.7
percent.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Demanding times
While capital expenditures have ground to a halt, one sector offers hope

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Has the telecom sector ""bottomed out?"" This is a question many
investors and those associated with the industry would like answered.
Certainly the US telecom sector has experienced a significant downturn
over the last 18 months, with tens of thousands of job cuts and capital
spending slashed. According to Lehman Brothers, 2002 will see a 20
percent reduction in capital expenditure (capex) across the sector.
Internationally, Merrill Lynch estimates that capex will also
decline in the Asia/Pacific, Europe and, most especially, the Latin
American telecom sectors in 2002.

INVESTools Advisory
By John Brobst, INVESTools.com


1. Fried Sells 4 Stocks, Locks in +46.8% in 3 Months (KM)

David Fried knows a stock is undervalued when the company's
management buys back its shares on the open market. His
latest triumph is pocketing an impressive +46.8% gain in
three short months by selling four buyback stocks. These
include a +43.3% gain on auto retailer Automation
Incorporated (AN) and a +62.7% gain on digital phone system
purveyor Inter-Tel (INTL).

Fried's most recent move is to buy KMart Corporation (KM),
the beleaguered discount retailer who just declared
bankruptcy. ""We do not think that K-Mart will go out of
business,"" Fried says. ""It will take a while but recovery is
a possibility."" He just bought 500 shares for $380.

Another Fried pick is C-Cor.net Corporation (CCBL), who
provides a range of technology services to broadband
networks. Today's telecom spending slowdown hit the company
hard; net sales fell 34% to $52 million last quarter and
caused a net loss of $5.4 million vs. a $5.8 million gain
last year. But Fried cites a buyback plan and a $1.5 million
restructuring charge as proof that management sees a rosier
future.

Portfolios,"" January 2002, The Buyback Letter. David Fried

----------------------------------------------------------
2. Rowe: January Index Confirms Bull Market for 2002 (ALOY)

Don Rowe says the January Index confirms that 2002 should
see a bull market. The first five trading days of 2002
provided gains for the Nasdaq (+5.4%), S&P 500 (+1.1%) and
Dow Industrials (+1.3%). Rowe says this five-day index has
correctly predicted the market's direction for the year
since 1951 with only four exceptions. Those include three
war years (1966, 1973, 1990) and 1994, when the Fed Funds
rate doubled from 3% to 6% for the year.

Rowe maintains ""be sure to own"" recommendations on seven
companies he says are leading the market. One of these is
Alloy Incorporated (ALOY); the media company and direct
marketer provides content, community and commerce to
""Generation Y,"" roughly 58 million people between 10 and 24
years of age. Rowe likes this market as it accounts for $250
billion in disposable income and should grow 20% faster than
the overall population. Q3 saw earnings up +119% on a 58%
increase in sales.

Another Rowe pick is New Century Financial Corporation
(NCEN). The financier makes, buys, sells and services sub-
prime mortgage loans secured by first mortgages on single-
family homes. Borrowers typically have plenty of equity in
their properties to secure a loan but suffer from weak
credit profiles or high debt-to-income ratios. Q3 earnings
grew +238% on a 56% hike in sales.

generating 26+% annual returns.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Small-Cap Advisor Earns +31.6% in 2001 (LBIX)

The major indexes suffered a terrible year, but Richard
Geist's 12 recommendations for 2001 earned a healthy +31.6%.
He lists many reasons why his selections should see growth
going forward. These include ""extremely bullish"" monetary
conditions with high productivity and no inflation in sight,
and a yield curve that continues to steepen. Also, investor
sentiment polls are becoming more bearish. ""These are always
a contrary indicator,"" he says.

Geist's latest recommendation is to buy shares of Leading
Brands (LBIX). The company is Canada's largest independent
food brand management company, and it is now expanding into
the US. Geist particularly likes how the firm saves money
with its integrated distribution system; the system makes
products from raw materials and provides packaging,
warehousing and distribution.

Recent financial results show that Leading Brands is on a
roll. FY 2001 saw revenues grow 70% to $49.8 million on net
income of $1.2 million ($0.09 per share), up from last
year's loss of ($608,000). Geist predicts the company will
see revenues reach $40 million in 2002 and $60 million in
2003. That yields a forward PE of 4.3. ""We think LBIX is
significantly undervalued,"" Geist says. ""In the $1 range,
Leading Brands is a strong buy.""

----------------------------------------------------------
4. Compounding Returns with Pine Trees (PCL)

Growing trees is not usually a noisy business that catches
the attention of the investment media. ""But it is a good
business,"" says Dick Young. The timber business is less
volatile and capital-intensive than manufacturing, and Young
sees demand for timber increasing as the population
increases. He notes how the average return on timber
investments has outperformed the S&P 500; from 1960 to 1999,
the average annual return was 13.6%.

Young's favorite timber play is Plum Creek Timber (PCL), one
of the largest private timberland owners in the US. The
REIT's primary goal is to profit by acquiring and managing
lands. Young says Plum Creek Timber's 8% yield and status as
a REIT makes it ideal for tax deferred accounts.

Another of Young's timber selections is Deltic Timber
Corporation (DEL). The company grows and harvests timber
from its over 430,000 acres in Arkansas and Louisiana. A
main company goal is to expand its timber holdings and
sustainable harvest level. Young says shares are a good
portfolio counterweight for value investors ""who appreciate
the intrinsic worth of underlying real natural resources.""

For more on Dick Young's advice see ""Investment Commentary,""

Young uses the buy-and-hold strategy of mentor Warren
Buffett to uncover low-risk, high-reward opportunities.

----------------------------------------------------------
5. Undervalued, High-yield Bank Puts Customers First (ASO)

Amsouth Bancorp (ASO) is giving investors a healthy yield
(4.43%) for the risk involved, says Jodie Weiss (Investment
Quality Trends). With $39 billion in assets, Amsouth is one
of the largest financial institutions in the south with more
than 600 offices. She credits the bank's success to ""putting
the customer first.""

Weiss likes how Amsouth uses new technology to save money by
streamlining operations. She notes how Amsouth just ranked
number six on eWeek's ""Fast Track 500"" list of companies
that deploy cutting-edge technology throughout operations;
at number 5, Merrill Lynch was the only financial services
firm who placed higher. Also, Amsouth's Internet banking
group quadrupled its customer base to 425,000 last year.

Weiss says ASO shares are undervalued. With the stock
selling near $20 and a yield of 4.43%, Weiss sees ""43%
upside potential."" Dividends have risen annually for the
past 11 years, a buyback plan for 25 million shares was
authorized in September 2001, and the stock's PE is a
reasonable 13x. ""When priced to yield 7.0%, ASO is
undervalued and a buy should be considered,"" Weiss says.

For more on Jodie Weiss' advice see ""Investment Spotlight,""
January 21, 2002, The Income Digest. The digest excerpts
from investment publications and highlights all-weather
income-oriented opportunities uncovered by the top minds on
Wall Street.

Text of Letter to Enron's Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

   Following is the text of an unsigned letter written in August to
Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K.
Skilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author
was later identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for
corporate development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee
released excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:

   Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't
get rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?
   Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting
improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in
its accounting -- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor
vehicle. We do have valuation issues with our international assets and
possibly some of our EES MTM positions.

   The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that
Skilling is leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can
be fixed and reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002.
How do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003,
we will have to pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.

   To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds
flow of $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a
vehicle (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in
later years. Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity
issuance?

   We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks
via our swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly
-- Avici by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power
Company by 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the
swaps won't be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to
offset these losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the
layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and
will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future.

   I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting
scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on
my resume, the business world will consider the past successes as
nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for
''personal reasons'' but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down
the road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship
now than resign in shame in two years.

   Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I
have thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into
one big problem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and
2000, we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold
stock, we then try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit
like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years
later. Nice try, but investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a
share looking for $120 a share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are
under too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled
''redeployed'' employees who know enough about the ''funny'' accounting
to get us in trouble.

   What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the
all-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and
Causey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is
going to happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?

   Summary of Alleged Issues:

   RAPTOR  Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at
risk; however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid
to LJM. If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is
no commitment to contribute more equity.

   The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some
form of Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.

   Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the
Raptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments we
hold.

   As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the
equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying
securities.

   This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying
capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing
for reserves against our MTM positions.

   To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we
''enhanced'' the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing
more ENE shares.

   My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must
''enhance'' the vehicles by $250 million.

   I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and
a lot of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting
treatment. None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are
ever disclosed in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's
problems of Waste Management -- where AA paid $130 million plus in
litigation re questionable accounting practices.)

   The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain
the ''accounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influence
his investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a
thorough understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it
correctly and/or change the accounting.

   My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the
transactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the
''entities'' described in our related party footnote are thinly
capitalized, the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the
value in the entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives
(unfortunately in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P.
Looking at the stock we swapped, I also don't believe any other company
would have entered into the equity derivative transactions with us at
the same prices or without substantial premiums from Enron. In other
words, the $500 million in revenue in 2000 would have been much lower.
How much lower?

   Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then
no one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance
to these entities would decline and the transactions would be less
noticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,
the New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser
degrees.

   I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a
clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the
transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities
law and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for
himself what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the
estimated damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one
of two courses of action:

   1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated
damage too great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly
reverse, unwind, write down these positions/transactions.

   2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages
to the company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage
containment plans and disclose.

   I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly
increased with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are
looking for a smoking gun.

   Summary of Raptor Oddities:

   1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.

   a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a
related party.

   b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk
except Enron.

   c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a
contribution of its own shares.

   One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in
its equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I
can't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who
will lose this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party
entity?

   If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact
pattern that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.

   2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms
length.

   a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party
at what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici
have fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to
lay off this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for
Enron.

   b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into
these transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was
the compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such
transactions?

   3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees
question our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This
alone is cause for concern.

   a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM.
He complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he
thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days
later, Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets
and never addressed the five steps with him.

   b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would
listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.

   c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal
investments group say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us,
but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' The
principal investments group hedged a large number of their investments
with Raptor. These people know and see a lot. Many similar comments are
made when you ask about these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as
saying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will never
lose money.

   4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the
money trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look
at LJM? At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?

   Condor and Raptor Work:

   1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the current
decision includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O.

   2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to
investigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron
attorney-client privilege on the work product. (Can't use V & E due to
conflict -- they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals).

   3. Law firm to hire one of the big 6, but not Arthur Andersen or
PricewaterhouseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest: AA & Co.
(Enron); PWC (LJM).

   4. Investigate the transactions, our accounting treatment and our
future commitments to these vehicles in the form of stock, NP, etc., For
instance: In the third quarter we have a $250 million problem with
Raptor 3 (NPW) if we don't ''enhance'' the capital structure of Raptor 3
to commit more ENE shares. By the way: in Q. 1 we enhanced the Raptor 3
deal, committing more ENE shares to avoid a write-down.

   5. Develop cleanup plan:

   a. Best case: Clean up quietly if possible.

   b. Worst case: Quantify, develop P.R. and I.R. campaigns, customer
assurance plans (don't want to go the way of Salomon's trading shop),
legal actions, severance actions, disclosure.

   6. Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if I'm all wet:

   a. Jeff McMahon

   b. Mark Koenig

   c. Rick Buy

   d. Greg Walley

   To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the following:

   1. We've contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entities.
Since it's contingent, we have the consideration given and received at
zero. We do, as Causey points out, include the shares in our fully
diluted computations of shares outstanding if the current economics of
the deal imply that Enron will have to issue the shares in the future.
This impacts 2002-2004 earnings-per-share projections only.

   2. We lost value in several equity investments in 2000, $500 million
of lost value. These were fair-value investments; we wrote them down.
However, we also booked gains from our price risk management
transactions with Raptor, recording a corresponding PRM account
receivable from the Raptor entities. That's a $500 million related party
transaction -- it's 20 percent of 2000 IBIT, 51 percent of NI pretax, 33
percent of NI after tax.

   3. Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor, reviews
the contingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities will
have enough capital to pay Enron its $500 million when the equity
derivatives expire.

   4. The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt; the value of the
contingent Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payable
that Raptor owes Enron. Raptor's inception-to-date income statement is a
$500 million loss.

   5. Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out? LJM is
whole on a cash-on-cash basis. Where did the $500 million in value come
from? It came from Enron shares. Why haven't we booked the transaction
as $500 million in a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and $500
million of value in our ''economic interests'' in these entities? Then
we would have a write-down of our value in the Raptor entities. We have
not booked the latter, because we do not have to yet. Technically we can
wait and face the music in 2002-2004.

   6. The related party footnote tries to explain these transactions.
Don't you think that several interested companies, be they stock
analysts, journalists, hedge fund managers, etc., are busy trying to
discover the reason Skilling left? Don't you think their smartest people
are poring over that footnote disclosure right now? I can just hear the
discussions -- ''it looks like they booked a $500 million gain from this
related party company and I think, from all the undecipherable half-page
on Enron's contingent contributions to this related party entity, I
think the related party entity is capitalized with Enron stock.'' . . .
. ''No, no, no, you must have it all wrong, it can't be that, that's
just too bad, too fraudulent, surely AA & Co. wouldn't let them get away
with that?'' ''Go back to the drawing board, it's got to be something
else. But find it!'' . . . . ''Hey, just in case you might be right, try
and find some insiders or 'redeployed' former employees to validate your
theory.''

"Jan 29, 2002 - Back from the dead","TODAY: Telecom equipment companies, long given up for dead, are
enjoying a recommendation renaissance, and one formerly dead DSL
provider, Covad (COVD), is back with a vengeance. The question,
says frequent contributor Dave Sterman, is whether it can ever
turn a profit.

Our top 10 most recommended list has a couple of newcomers, and
Morgan Stanley discusses the key investment strengths and risks
of Motorola (MOT), in a report which you can get for free as a
Multex Investor member by registering for the firm's free
research trial. See details below.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Upward revisions: Analysts see brighter earnings picture for three equipment companies
In an uncertain market, analysts seem sure about the earnings potential of these companies

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The reduction in capital spending by major carriers has weighed on
telecom equipment stock performance in recent months, and threatens
to do so throughout 2002. The consensus estimate now appears to be
a 26 percent drop in carrier capital expenditures in 2002 resulting
in a 23 percent decline in aggregate revenues for the equipment group.

2. Horror story: Covad is back from the dead
The company's rebirth is miraculous. But there's a problem: No
one knows if it can still make money.

By Dave Sterman, equity research analyst

The demise of NorthPoint Communications, Rhythms NetConnections,
and Covad Communications (COVD) in 2001 seemed to spell the end
of the data local exchange carrier (DLEC) sector. Investors were
left to conclude that the DSL industry would now reside squarely
in the hands of the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs),
such as Verizon (VZ), SBC (SBC), Qwest (Q), and BellSouth (BLS).

But to the surprise of many, one DLEC, Covad, has emerged from the
ashes to fight another day. At least one analyst thinks the company
is poised to get it right this time.

3. Good values: A tale of two values
This pair of wireless infrastructure stocks offers long-term growth--
don't let the prices fool you

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

Over the past two years, as the market's become more challenging,
investors are learning to be more selective than they used to be.
Rather than seizing momentum and growth, which worked well in the
'90s, successful investors are adopting a value orientation.

But which discounted stocks represent true value and which are
inexpensive simply because the company they symbolize is no good? In
telecom, where most stocks have gotten hammered, it can be especially
difficult to distinguish between duds bargains.

4. Fishin' chips: Consolidation and content
Wireless semiconductor stocks wrestle for share of a shrinking market

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

As we saw in the IPO market in recent years, fast-growing
industries attracted a number of new players. But now that those
industries have matured, growth has slowed and many smaller players
are looking to merge in order to compete against the top tier
players. As we noted a few weeks ago, wireless service providers
in particular look set to engage in a merger orgy.

It now appears that the same could be said for the wireless
semiconductor industry. As growth in wireless handset sales has slowed,
chip vendors are also looking to march down the aisle. In mid-December,
Alpha Industries (AHAA) and Conexant (CNXT) announced plans to merge
their wireless chip divisions.

And more deals may emerge in the months to come. ""We wouldn't be
surprised to see additional activity as companies work to reach
critical mass at a much higher level than in the past,"" says
CIBC's Dale Pfau. Many players added factory capacity just as
the industry slowed.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Enron-gate
The financial engineering bubble has finally burst

By Rick Wayman, CFA

Just when you thought it was safe to invest again, Enron-gate has roiled
the financial waters Investors, barely recovered from a hangover caused
by a myriad of causes that include the dot-com bubble, Sept. 11th, and
the recession, now face a much bigger challenge: the loss of faith in the
core underpinnings of all investing decisions, financial reporting.

Enron-gate is an apt name because, like the Watergate and
Whitewatergate scandals before it, a problem that initially appeared
isolated is spreading (like a cancer on the Presidency) to encompass a
much larger universe of players. Every day, another company
announces that it has to restate its operating results. The trustworthiness
of the reporting process and the accounting profession itself is being
called into question.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Marvell sets its sights on Broadcom (BRCM)
Broadcom still dominates the communications chip sector, but Marvell
(MRVL) is growing at a torrid clip.

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Few firms have been able to grow as quickly as Broadcom (BRCM).
The communications chip maker saw its sales rise from $42 million in
1997 to more than $1 billion by 2000. Investors who got in early made
huge profits as shares of Broadcom rose twenty-fold from its spring 1998
IPO to its 2000 peak.

But just as Broadcom is looking to maintain its base of revenues while
the communications chip sector experiences a cyclical lull, a previously
obscure competitor has managed to grow through the downturn and is
setting its sights on the industry's number one spot. Marvell Technology
Group (MRVL) has been growing at a torrid clip, having already
surpassed the industry's next largest player, PMC-Sierra (PMCS).

		<!-- **AUTHOR** --><font face=""verdana,geneva,sans-serif"" size=""-2""><b>By Rick Wayman</b>, CFA</font>
		<font face=""verdana,geneva,sans-serif"" size=""-1"">
<p>Just when you thought it was safe to invest again, Enron-gate has roiled
the financial waters Investors, barely recovered from a hangover caused
by a myriad of causes that include the dot-com bubble, Sept. 11th, and
the recession, now face a much bigger challenge: the loss of faith in the
core underpinnings of all investing decisions, financial reporting. </p>

<p>Enron-gate is an apt name because, like the Watergate and
Whitewatergate scandals before it, a problem that initially appeared
isolated is spreading (like a cancer on the Presidency) to encompass a
much larger universe of players. Every day, another company
announces that it has to restate its operating results. The trustworthiness
of the reporting process and the accounting profession itself is being
called into question. <a href=""http://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=6588&nd=0131"">Click here to read more.</a></p>

(MRVL) is growing at a torrid clip.</font><br>
		<!-- **AUTHOR** --><font face=""verdana,geneva,sans-serif"" size=""-2""><b>By Dave Sterman</b>, equity research columnist</font>
		<font face=""verdana,geneva,sans-serif"" size=""-1"">

<p>Few firms have been able to grow as quickly as Broadcom (BRCM).
The communications chip maker saw its sales rise from $42 million in
1997 to more than $1 billion by 2000. Investors who got in early made
huge profits as shares of Broadcom rose twenty-fold from its spring 1998
IPO to its 2000 peak.</p>

<p>But just as Broadcom is looking to maintain its base of revenues while
the communications chip sector experiences a cyclical lull, a previously
obscure competitor has managed to grow through the downturn and is
setting its sights on the industry&#146;s number one spot. Marvell Technology
Group (MRVL) has been growing at a torrid clip, having already
surpassed the industry&#146;s next largest player, PMC-Sierra (PMCS). <a href=""http://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=6592&nd=0131"">Click here to read more.</a>

"February 1, 2002 - Name your price","
In today's edition of the Daily Update, Ben Macklin, senior analyst
at eMarketer, does the math for readers curious to know if Comcast
(CMCSK ) paid a fair price for AT&T's (T) broadband business. Also today,
equity research columnist Dave Sterman reads the mood on Wall Street and

Investment ideas

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
What is the value of the digital home?
Comcast is paying approximately $5,830 for each AT&T
Broadband household. Is this a fair price?

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

Comcast (CMCSA) is in the process of acquiring AT&T's (T)
broadband unit and its 12 million cable households for
approximately $70 billion. Comcast's investment equates to
approximately $5,830 per AT&T Broadband household.  Is this a
fair price?

As has been widely reported, this deal will create the largest cable
company in North America, with 22.3 million subscribers. The
current value of the digital home is far less than what Comcast is
currently paying, but the future digital home may hold great
potential.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Exiting 2001 on a high note
The telecom sector took it on the chin last year, but some companies
gave brighter guidance for 2002.

By Dave Sterman

For the second straight year, the telecom sector took it on the chin. Many
companies are now bagging a fraction of the revenues they garnered just
a few years ago. But word has quietly spread that the industry may have
bottomed and that 2002 may bring better returns.

3. TRANSCRIPTS
On Wednesday, Steve Lord, editor of The Adivsor's Digest, participated
in a live Q&A session with investors on the site. Here is one of the many
questions he answered.

Question: In 1973-74, more than one-third of the value of the S&P
500 was erased and Warren Buffett said that it was the time to
invest and get rich. Is it that time again?

Steve Lord: Buffett has recently come out and said he expects a five to
eight year dry spell following the party we've all just been through. So
you can figure we've got at best a three year dry spell left. Buffett also
said that the length of the hangover is directly proportional to the length
of the party. And personally, I remember from my college days that the
length of the hangover can exceed the length of the party! There's
nothing I've seen that indicates that Buffett is remotely bullish on
anything concerning the broader market.

"Winner of the Vintage Enron Golf Shirt!!!!","




It was a tough decision, but Angela and I have picked a winner and two runners-up for coming up with the most creative idea for the ""mystery item.""  The winners and their answers are listed below:

Winner: 

David Hanslip for his answer of: 

""...To the casual observer, they look like the support pillars of any standard monitor stand. In reality, their special hollowed out interiors may be used to conceal sensitive accounting documents outlining off-balance sheet financing transactions from the FBI.""

Second Runner Up: 
Paul Dunsmore for his answer of: 
""They are clearly snow shoes for the Smurfs that live in our office..."" 
Third Runner Up: 
Carlee Gawiuk for her answer of: 
""The purpose of the object is for getting the attention of the commercial staff when they are not paying attention to their admin assistants.  There are 6 of them, 3 for each phone.  Simply pick up the object, close your fist around it, extend your arm behind your head, bring it forward in a fluid motion and release the object in the general direction of the person you are wanting to get the attention of.  If it takes more then one throw, that is completely acceptable.  It takes a little practice, so don't be too hard on your self if you need to borrow a few from the other phone.  It is not too big, so no serious damage will be done, & it's not too small so the person or anyone surrounding them will not lose an eye.  The colour is black to contrast with desk, or floor, so it is easy to find after it has been thrown.""

Thank you to everyone else for your very creative answers! 
Congratulations to David, Paul, and Carlee (you may drop by front reception to pick up your prize)!!! 
Thank you,

"January 8, 2002 - New Year's resolutions","
In today's edition of the Daily Update, we offer a spate of ideas and some
promises we hope are kept. Like many of us at this time of year, certain
telcos are trying to shed excess pounds (of debt) to make themselves
more attractive (to investors), and equity research columnist Dave
Sterman does his best impression of a personal trainer keeping his eye
on analyst sentiment.

The new year also means new conditions for private B2B exchanges,
and eMarketer senior analyst Steve Butler explains how the survivors are
adapting.

Finally, Morgan Stanley has a stock idea for investors with an appetite
for wireless, but are leery of indigestion. Multex Investor members get a
free insight into Alltel (AT) thanks to the free research trial available
exclusively to them (that's you).

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Portly telcos
Telecom stocks trying to slalom through tough conditions while carrying
a few extra pounds of debt

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Telecom bankruptcies have been making headlines for most of the last
year. Struggling upstarts that borrowed too much money had to fold up
shop as the cash ran out and creditors came knocking. But debt
problems of another sort are cropping up for much larger telecom firms.
These companies are not candidates for bankruptcy, but staggering debt
loads may hinder their operational flexibility and could even cause them
to radically scale back their businesses. For equity investors, the
situation certainly bears watching.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
How the survivors have evolved
From passive transaction-based units to active technology providers and,
ultimately, proselytizers

By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer

At the beginning of 2001, eMarketer selected five so-called ""independent
exchanges"" that we believed were worth watching during the course of
the year. Chosen for the diversity of their vertical industry operations,
these benchmark exchanges were noted as useful indicators of the
success or failure of online exchange-based trade within various
industries.
Known as a pioneer within the energy industry and among business-to-
business (B2B) exchanges in general, Altra Market Place was placed on
the list because of its background as a facilitator of commodity-based
trade. Citadon has long emphasized its Web-based, collaborative
software for the engineering and building industry, while eMerge
Interactive (EMRG) was initially known as a cattle broker with extensive
online and offline trading operations.
MetalSite was selected because of its presence within the highly-
competitive online steel-trading industry, and SciQuest (SQST) was
noted for its leadership as a provider of Internet-based catalog and
trading technology for the life sciences industry.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

INVESTools Advisory
Compiled by John Brobst, INVESTools.com


1. 2001 Portfolio +36%; 2002 Portfolio Just Released (C)

In December 2000, Frank Curzio issued a portfolio of 10 stocks he
predicted would do well in the coming year. He was right. Despite
the market's troubles, his portfolio gained an impressive +36%.
Aiming for a repeat performance, he just released his portfolio
for 2002. ""Do not procrastinate,"" he advises. ""We urge investors
to buy all of our situations. Do not just pick and choose.""

One of Curzio's picks is Citigroup (C). The financial services
goliath stands to do well during an economic turnaround
particularly while interest rates remain low. Curzio sees
management making the right moves to boost earnings; for instance,
it will spin-off 20% of its Travelers Insurance group in 2002.

Another Curzio recommendation is to sell short Broadcom (BRCM).
The firm's chips enable broadband digital data transmission to
residences and businesses over communication networks. Curzio
considers today's short-term economic uncertainty and calls the
stock ""overvalued"" with a P/E multiple near 140. ""Look for a
steady pullback throughout the first quarter. Sell short,"" Curzio
advises.

For more on Frank Curzio's advice see ""FXC's 10 Picks for 2002.""
Francis X. Curzio provides asset growth and capital preservation
with a list of picks in key categories for the coming year.

----------------------------------------------------------
2. Forecast 2002: Mostly Sunny, Particularly for Small Caps (NYFX)

In January 2001, Jim Oberweis made a number of predictions for the
year that hit the bullseye. For example, the market rallied in
early 2001 but fell for most of the year. Small-caps outperformed
large-caps, and short-term interest rates fell sharply while bond
rates rose, eliminating the inverted yield curve. For 2002,
Oberweis sees large-caps returning an average 8% to 10%, well
below the 20% annual average of the 1990s. ""We continue to believe
that small-caps will buck the trend and offer very good
opportunities for investors,"" he predicts.

To capitalize, Oberweis offers a list of five new small-cap picks.
One of these is Nyfix (NYFX). The firm makes electronic trading
systems for brokerages that trade in equities and derivatives.
Blue-chip customers like Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, UBS
Warburg and Merrill Lynch use the Nyfix Network to send trading
orders to exchange floors electronically.

Last quarter, revenues grew a healthy 75% to $11.4 million and
boosted EPS 65% to $0.10. Oberweis sees Nyfix growing revenues
(and EPS) from $24 million ($0.21) in 2000 to $40 million ($0.32)
in 2001 and again to $60 million ($1.05) in 2002. His asset
management clients now own roughly 34,000, and he maintains a buy
sign on the stock.

For more on Jim Oberweis' advice see ""Currently Recommended
Stocks,"" January 2002, The Oberweis Report. Jim Oberweis invests
in small-cap stocks with revenue and earnings growing at least 30%
and mid-caps growing at least 20%.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Time to Buy Disney (DIS)

Chuck Carlson admits having a tough time getting excited about
Disney (DIS). For instance, the entertainment giant's theme park
is mired by a sluggish economy, fears of terrorism and erratic gas
prices. The anemic ad market continues to hurt its ABC network,
and its film business has turned in a spotty performance.

Carlson sees today's slump as a buy opportunity. ""Disney has brand
names that would make any marketer salivate,"" he says. The firm
has not had a new hit TV show since ""Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire,"" but Carlson says Disney's creative teams ""don't stay
in dry spells for very long."" Also, consumers will eventually
start flying to its theme parks again as economic and terrorist
concerns abate.

At today's low prices, stock in Disney is fully discounting bad
earnings for at least the next two quarters, according to Carlson.
Shares are well off their 2000 highs near $44. That means
investors can buy ""a quality blue chip at an affordable price,""
Carlson says. He recommends buying as ""the stock offers good long-
term upside potential.""

For more on Chuck Carlson's advice see ""DRIP Analyst,"" January
2002, DRIP Investor. Chuck Carlson provides guidance to buying
stocks without a broker via dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs).

----------------------------------------------------------
4. Zacks: Biovail Set to Gain 10+% in 2002 (BVF)

Ben Zacks does not beat around the bush about the prospects for
Biovail (BVF). ""Investors who buy Biovail in the $54 - $55 range
can expect an appreciation of 10+% over the next 12 months,"" Zacks
says. The firm makes medicines based on its proprietary oral
controlled-release drug delivery technology. Its biggest hit is
Tiazac, a treatment for hypertension and angina. Tiazac beats
competing drugs as it requires only a daily dose and has fewer
side effects.

Zacks lists many other reasons why Biovail is a good bet for 2002.
For example, revenues last quarter grew 63% to $152.2 million, net
income rose 37% to $55.8 million, and the firm beat analyst EPS
estimates of $0.36 by a penny a share. Also, Biovail just inked a
host of marketing pacts with Glaxo Smith Kline that should boost
sales.

Biovail shares are not cheap at 33x EPS estimates of $1.66 for
2002. But Zacks remains optimistic. ""The high valuation is
justified by the company's high long-term EPS growth rate of 30%,""
he says. He agrees with six of the 16 analysts covering Biovail
who maintain a 'strong buy' rating.

For more on Ben Zacks' advice see ""Stock Pick of the Month,""
January 2002, Zacks Advisor. Ben Zacks uses earnings estimate
revisions from analysts at brokerages to select stocks likely to
outperform the market over the next 12 months.

5. Smallest Stocks are the Places to Be (BLPG)

The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks just chalked up its
third straight year of outperformance by advancing 1% vs. a -13%
slump for the S&P 500. Rich Moroney sees more growth like this in
2002 as small-stock cycles like this one ""tend to persist."" In
particular, micro-caps should see another great year even after
providing the bulk of last year's growth.

Moroney profiles two micro-caps he calls ""especially promising""
for 2002. The first is Boron, LePore & Associates (BLPG), who
provides marketing, education and sales services to healthcare
providers. The stock jumped 65% since hitting bottom in September
2001 due to profit and terrorism concerns. But Moroney predicts
significant improvements for the December quarter thanks to a
rebound in travel and postponed business.

A consensus of analysts pegs Q4 EPS at $0.21, a gain of 40% over
the same quarter last year. Management forecasts full-year EPS
will reach $0.80 to $0.84. Moroney calls the stock ""reasonably
priced"" at 20x 2002 estimates and below 1x sales. ""The stock, with
support near $12.25, is rated 'buy',"" he says.

For more on Rich Moroney's advice see ""Featured Report,"" January
7, 2002, Low Priced Stock Survey. Richard Moroney offers
fundamentally solid small- and mid-caps ready to soar 40% to
400%+.

1. INVESTING STRATEGIES
Relative momentum
The ""greater fool"" theory sounds funny, but it isn't a
laughing matter.

By Marc Gerstein, director of investment research

It's tempting to assume that everyone who strays from
broad principles of stock valuation will eventually
come to regret it. Resist that temptation. Different
investment methods can succeed, assuming they are well
executed.

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  I have been extremely busy.
I am around on that weekend.  I am supposed to be at a conference that
weekend.  However if the teachers are still on strike the conference will be
cancelled.  Here's hoping!

It will be good to see you guys that weekend.  When you know, give me a

around the conference even if it is a go.

I don't know about you but I am really getting sick of this weather!  I want

Remind me when you are down and I will give you that cleansing info.  Looks
like I am going to start me cleanse on Friday. I am loading up on all the
beef, sugar and wheat I can!  It's hell but those are the foods I really
miss while cleansing!

Better run!  Have clients coming in shortly!  Have a good one!

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
The long and the short
Economic factors that will impact the market and investors--and vice
versa

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

Last year capped the worst two-year stock tumble since 1973-1974, and
effectively eliminated all the hype and hope that mobilized individual
investors during the late 1990s. (Although it is unlikely that the
individuals who remain in the market continue to expect the returns of
yesteryear, investors probably still expect too much from the broad
market.)

Today, investors are understandably concerned about the market, and are
leery of chasing stocks. However, there will be a time during the year
when you've just missed the boat (as most missed it last year). And I'm
just as sure that something will test the resolve of the market--an event or
series of events that will send stocks tumbling.

However, I think it is a big mistake for investors to wait for it, or to wait
for some type of testing of the bottom. By the same token, however, I
think it is still important to take profits and maybe be a little more
flexible with stops. I suspect that after two years of depression, this
market will still suffer from bouts of mental instability. Let those bi-polar
moments work for you. There are tons of funds on the sidelines waiting
to chase this market. Keep a steady head, don't panic, and stop worrying
about the worse case scenarios. Fundamental change cannot happen until
we see a change of mind among investors.

Below are my thoughts on leading economic indicators, market trends,
my picks of the year, and some sector ideas.

Economic check-up
Seven economic indicators that point to a mid-year recovery

By William Valentine, CFA

Going to the doctor is not always a pleasant experience, but it's always
good to get a check-up. I'm reminded of the contrasts of such
experiences by the goings-on around the Valentine household. In the
same week that we're going to see our healthy in utero baby on an
ultrasound monitor, my Labrador retriever is going to see the doggy doc
in order to have his sireship extracted.

And it's with these visuals (you're welcome), that I lead you to my point
about check-ups and the economy. For it's time to check in on my ""Big
Seven"" indicators in order to see whether we'll get the mid-year recovery
that everyone seems to be counting on, or if this check-up leads to a dog-
on forecast.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Market on the cusp, investors on the edge
You can't stand the truth, so stay in the kitchen

By Charles Payne, principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

There is no doubt that the topic of the week is trust. Each day saw a new
scandal and a new perpetrator. Even though Enron (ENE) continues to hog
the headlines, the Houston based energy trader (I guess that's what they
were) wasn't the only company called to the mat on ethics and
accounting (next month the country celebrates Lincoln's birthday, and
although he'd be beaming about how everyone has come together to
support the battle against evil, he wouldn't be too happy with the goings
on in the corporate world).

In the meantime, corporate earnings took a back seat to the daily
revelations of improprieties. Even the eagerly awaited testimony of Alan
Greenspan became a sideshow of sorts. After spending the last year or
so soul-searching for reasons as to why they took such an
unceremonious bath in the stock market, investors have come to find
that they were never fully aware of the goings-on behind closed doors.
There are a lot of questions to be answered, both legal and ethical, yet in
many ways we already know the answers and will never get the details.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Can EMC (EMC) stay atop the data storage mountain?
Still the market share king, margins and analyst confidence are waning
for this former stalwart

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

The boom in data storage has become a bust. Prices for data storage
gear have plunged as heavy competition has led to fierce price wars.
Few have taken a deeper hit from the storage sector's comedown than
industry leader EMC (EMC).

1. Chip wars: Marvell sets its sights on Broadcom (BRCM)
Broadcom still dominates the communications chip sector, but
Marvell (MRVL) is growing at a torrid clip.

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Few firms have been able to grow as quickly as Broadcom (BRCM). The
communications chip maker saw its sales rise from $42 million in 1997 to more than $1
billion by 2000. Investors who got in early made huge profits as shares of Broadcom rose
twenty-fold from its spring 1998 IPO to its 2000 peak.

But just as Broadcom is looking to maintain its base of revenues while the
communications chip sector experiences a cyclical lull, a previously obscure competitor
has managed to grow through the downturn and is setting its sights on the industry's
number one spot. Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) has been growing at a torrid
clip, having already surpassed the industry's next largest player, PMC-Sierra (PMCS).

2. Bullish outlook: Exiting 2001 on a high note
The telecom sector took it on the chin last year, but some companies gave brighter guidance for 2002.

By Dave Sterman

For the second straight year, the telecom sector took it on the chin. Many companies are
now bagging a fraction of the revenues they garnered just a few years ago. But word has
quietly spread that the industry may have bottomed and that 2002 may bring better
returns.

To find any potential pockets of strength, we used NetScreen Pro, the professional
version of Multex Investor's Net Screen (http://www.multexinvestor.com/screen/AScreen.asp),
to look for telecom firms that have recently given brighter guidance for the coming year.
We can find strong guidance by looking at the body language of analysts. If analysts are
raising estimates and raising their ratings, then management is likely providing a more
bullish outlook.

3. Wireless woes: Rising subscriber turnover hurts PCS affiliates
Sprint's tougher stance on low credit customers is key factor

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Sprint PCS (PCS) has decided to get tough with certain low credit customers. To date, the
group getting punished by that decision is not the customers, but Sprint's own regional
affiliates.

The move has increased subscriber turnover, thereby lowering net customer additions for the
likes of AirGate PCS (PCSA), Alamosa PCS (APS) and US Unwired (UNWR). It also has
fed investors' perception that there's no growth in sight for wireless stocks.

4. Good values: East meets west
Forget the rumors -- this dynamic duo of far-flung wireless telcos is down but not out

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

The search for bargains among under-priced telecom stocks can lead fearless
investors in surprising directions.

Consider the case of two wireless companies traded on the New York Stock
Exchange but based at opposite ends of the earth. Both have plunged more than
20 percent in the past four weeks. Yet analysts expect them to post long-term
earnings growth of 20 percent or better, and rate them squarely between ""buy""
and ""strong buy,"" at 1.5.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Looking ahead: Analysts predict solid 2002 for cable TV stocks
Consolidation and EBITDA growth will be the year's major themes

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Investors relying on cable television stocks as a defensive
investment were disappointed in 2001, as the group fell by about
20 percent, compared with the a drop of ""just"" 13 percent for the
S&P 500. But investors who now abandon the industry may find
themselves even more disappointed in 2002.

Analysts are projecting a strong year for cable companies,
predicting revenue growth of 13 percent and EBITDA growth of 14
percent. They also believe most of the stocks are more fairly
valued heading into 2002 than they were at the outset of last
year, when a late-2000 runup left them overpriced.

Adding to analysts' enthusiasm is the recent completion of
Comcast's (CMCSK) purchase of AT&T's (T) broadband unit. The
merger underscores the value of broadband and its ability to offer
voice, data and video over the same pipe.

2. Dept. of silver linings: Dampening the mood
Why Nortel (NT) and Lucent (LU) may be playing the reverse- psychology game

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Lucent Technologies (LU) and Nortel Networks (NT) delivered their
twisted versions of holiday cheer in recent weeks, telling
analysts that sales are slowing yet further, and admitting that
forward-looking estimates will have to come down--yet again.

But with their shares languishing in single-digits despite a
broad year-end Nasdaq rally, analysts have been softening their
positions, even to the point of seeing silver linings in these
recent whipping-boy stocks.

Indeed, some analysts believe that the beleaguered telecom
equipment vendors may be deliberately dampening investor
enthusiasm and even underreporting or delaying booking some
revenues in order to boost March 2002-quarter results (and make
for easier December 2002 comparisons to boot).

3. International wires: Counter-consensus
These four telecom services companies bear analysts' lowest ratings, but is that really bad news?

By Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

Last week, we looked at underrated international telco equipment
companies. Today, we're featuring four international telecom
services companies traded in the U.S. that tote an average
analyst rating of 4 (""underperform"") or worse.

Why would an investor want to consider a poorly rated stock?
Let's put it this way: A highly rated stock means a lot of people
already like it. If you like it too, you're going with the flow,
following the pack. Me-too investing may do all right, but it's
better to get there first, to blaze the trail. True value is
added only if the investment opinion is different, counter-
consensus, and of course, on the money. In other words, no guts,
no glory.

4. Burden of proof: Portly telcos
Telecom stocks trying to slalom through tough conditions while carrying a few extra pounds of debt

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Telecom bankruptcies have been making headlines for most of the
last year. Struggling upstarts that borrowed too much money had
to fold up shop as the cash ran out and creditors came knocking.
But debt problems of another sort are cropping up for much larger
telecom firms. These companies are not candidates for bankruptcy,
but staggering debt loads may hinder their operational
flexibility and could even cause them to radically scale back
their businesses. For equity investors, the situation certainly
bears watching.

INVESTools Advisory
Compiled by John Brobst, INVESTools.com


1. Toral: ""Prepare for a Good 2002"" (DYII)

Al Toral says investors now anticipate a recovery, and he
reminds skeptics of how easily the market overcame
disappointing news about Q3 GDP. Corporate inventories now
need replenishing, lower energy costs and interest rates are
encouraging near-term growth, and labor costs have dropped.
""Each one of us breathes a sigh of relief now that the year
2001 is behind us, and all of us will find that the market
in 2002 will be far more productive and rewarding,"" he says.

To capitalize, Toral recommends buying stock in a list of
handpicked companies, and one of his favorites is Dynacq
International (DYII). The firm provides home care infusion
services and supplies. It also trains patients to administer
medicines and nutrients themselves through IVs and feeding
tubes.

Dynacq has been growing rapidly. Revenues rose from $11
million in 1998 to over $31 million for the first three
quarters of 2001. Profit margins averaged 18% and earnings
grew 100+% over the last three years. Three stock splits
rewarded investors since 1998. ""We see Dynacq as an
excellent growth stock that is not too volatile for the
conservative investor,"" Toral says.

2002, The Pure Fundamentalist. Alvin Toral uses key
fundamental data to select aggressive growth stocks.

----------------------------------------------------------
2. A Leader in Telecom's Eventual Rebound (ADCT)

ADC Telecommunications (ADCT) enjoyed a nice long run.
Through the 1990s, revenues grew more than tenfold and
peaked at over $3 billion in 2000. Its stock reflected this
as it peaked at $49. But when the telecom bubble burst,
sales for ADC dropped 27% from the prior year to $2.4
billion. The firm posted an annual loss of $1.64 a share,
its first since 1985.

But turnaround expert George Putnam sees better times ahead
for the supplier of products for fiber optics, networking,
equipment and software. ""Telecom will be one of the leading
industries for the foreseeable future,"" he says. ""We believe
ADC will not only survive, but perhaps be one of the first
telecom suppliers to rebound."" He points to its cash-rich
and debt-free balance sheet, layoffs of 40+%, and other
measures that cut capital expenditures by 60%.

Putnam sees signs that ADC's business is already rebounding.
For instance, the firm just won several new contracts and is
gaining market share. A rebounding economy means more demand
for communication services, and Putnam says that means
growing demand for ADC's equipment. ""We recommend buying ADC
up to $7,"" he says.

concentrates on out-of-favor companies ripe for a turnaround
while trading at a discount to their true value.

3. Rip-Roaring Returns from the Post-September 2001 Rebound
(EMC)

Steve Harmon made some great calls around the September 2001
market bottom. For instance, he said ""buy"" to eight stocks
in the travel security sector. All but one of these is
handsomely in the black, with standouts like Invision
Technologies (INVN) gaining +262% and Identix (IDNX) up
+103%. He also said ""buy"" to Checkpoint Software (CHKP), and
it has since gained a healthy 68%.

Going forward, one of Harmon's favorite sectors is network
technology. Current favorites include data storage kingpin
EMC (EMC). ""Today's commerce relies heavily on intellectual
assets -- DATA -- without which corporations would be
hampered to do business,"" Harmon says. Little wonder that
EMC's client list is chock full of Fortune 500 companies.

But Harmon's current favorite is Network Appliance (NTAP),
whose shares have rocketed 80% to $26 since November 2001.
The firm recently launched NearStore, a new data storage
solution that enterprise clients can use to restore data
cheaply and quickly. ""With EMC, NTAP, Hitachi (HIT) and IBM
(IBM), you could own a basket of the leaders in storage as a
sector play in the near-term,"" Harmon recommends.

investors at the forefront of the convergence of technology,
entertainment, communication, commerce and fiber-optics.

----------------------------------------------------------
4. Rex Stores Still a Bargain (RSC)

Stock in Rex Stores (RSC) has climbed over 55% from $18 in
July 2001 to over $28. The retailer buys current models of
consumer electronics and appliances that become available at
a discount because of manufacturer overruns and cancelled
orders. Buyback expert David Fried first recommended Rex
last July and he sees more growth in store even after its
price runup.

""Management has put its money where its mouth is,"" Fried
says. Over the past year, Rex bought back over 25% of its
outstanding shares, and today's buyback program allows it to
repurchase another 10%. Recent results show why. Q3 EPS rose
72% to $0.50 thanks to a rise in gross margins to 28.5% that
boosted net income 55% to $4.4 million.

Fried notes that Rex's market cap is about $180 million;
this is just $40 million more than a conservative estimate
of the after-tax value of tax credits and depreciated value
of real estate on the books. ""Buying $1 for $0.66 is an easy
decision,"" he says. ""We are confident that this holding will
add to our outstanding record of picks in our portfolio.""

5. Enron Debt Woes Bad News for Bank (JPM)

JP Morgan Chase (JPM) continues to be plagued by its
exposure to debt from failed energy trader Enron. The
venerable bank recently said this exposure is $1 billion
more than the $900 million previously announced. Adding
insult to injury, a group of insurers continue to delay
payment of $965 million until the bank says more about its
forward sales contracts to Enron.

Bernie Schaeffer sees more tough times ahead for JP Morgan
Chase & advises an option play to capitalize. He notes that
shares continue to trade below their 10-day and 20-day
moving averages after bouncing off of the $40 level in
November and December. Longer term, the stock trades far
below its 10-month, 20-month and 40-month moving averages,
all of which are heading south.

Meanwhile, always-wrong option punters lowered short
interest by 12% last month. Schaeffer sees the moves of
option traders as a contrary indicator. He recently advised
buying the June 40 put (JPMRH).

How Does He Do It?

A former computer specialist and high-tech venture capitalist,
Steve Harmon knows the ins & outs of the technology business --
and he sees things that most financial advisors and investors
miss. Broadband Investor deciphers the confusion, chaos and
disruption in the complex but lucrative sectors for today's
investors.

Harmon focuses on companies with the strongest fundamentals,
like market leadership, sales and earnings growth, sector
potential, and management strength. And he steers clear of
momentum darlings that run on hot air but deflate quickly
when speculators run away.

See for yourself why Investors Chronicle calls Steve Harmon
""One of the top 10 online commentators."" Why Smart Money lauds
him as ""One of three rising stars in technology investing.""

And start getting your share of the post-September 2001 rebound
today! Take a no-risk 30-day FREE trial to Broadband Investor.
