Christi,

If you don't mind, I'd like to weigh in on your message below and share my perspective with you regarding the actions you are considering taking.

Timing, they say, is everything.  While we may ultimately want to file an action with FERC as you describe, I don't think the timing to make such a filing is now or the next 3-6 months.  I also don't think we should make such a filing alone.  

With my being from the Eastern Interconnection (23+ years at the New York Power Pool) I understand how everyone in  the east feels when they hear, ""it's different in the West"", but after spending the past 5 years in the west, the fact is, it is different!  

Here are my reasons I don't think the time is not right for making a filing:
The west is ground zero for the disaster known as California - fact of the matter is, I am amazed that the utilities in the west are even still participating in talks about forming RTO's.  California has significantly hurt ours and everyone elses efforts, not just in retail, but wholesale as well.  Any effort to merge, or force anyone in the west, together with CAISO would meet with significant resistance.
The make up of the parties is considerably different from the east.  The Municipalities(SMUD, Seattle City Light, Tacoma), Government Authorities (WAPA, BPA, SRP) and Public Power Districts (too numberous to mention) are significantly larger and stronger (politically) than those in the East.  They use their political influence to their maximum benefit.  Again, the resistance to merge with CA will be great but include a message that would include these groups as quasi-FERC juristictional, would not especially fair well at this point.
As Steve points out below, there has been much political work done on the state level in the west to at least continue moving the parties in RTO West and DSTAR forward.  And while the folks at DSTAR are not ideal, at least they have gotten the message to ""do-something"" and they ar moving faster than I would have predicited just 2 months ago.  Any filing as described below would surely slow down the process at this point.  
In working with Duke, Reliant, Mirant and Dynegy in filing comments on the July DSTAR informatioal filing all parties, while they agree that ultimately we want a west-wide RTO, they will not agree to language within the comments which discusses a west-wide RTO at this point in time.  All parties cite similar reasons as stated above for this decision.

The goal as I see it in the west and the east as well (for now), is to continue supporting the formation of the two new RTOs.  Wait to see how the Mediation process for the Northeast and Southeast takes form and the reaction to any ALJ decisions, then re-assess the climate in the political arena in regards to de-regulation and the utility industry as well as our position.  If after this evaluation we still feel compelled to file, attempt to garner support for the initiative with a coalition of marketers and generators.  

I hope you don't mind my sending out these comments but as Steve stated below, this filing, while may ultimately be necessary to file, is probably best held off, at least until we can see what DSTAR, RTO West and the mediation ALJs all submit to FERC for consideration.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Dear Jim, 
Insight Information Company (www.insightinfo.com) is developing and presenting a conference on Deregulation of Electricity Market in California: Experiences Learned, Perils and Opportunities (working title), and they have asked me to chair the conference.  Insight Information is a leading provider of programs for North American business, executive and professional communities.  The conference is scheduled for November 5 and 6 in San Francisco.  Tentative panel titles include 
? Understanding Restructuring: The Regulator's Perspective 
? The Role of Fuel Supply Mix 
? Restructuring and Technological Change 
? Price-Responsive Demand 
? Energy Services and the Entrepreneurial Firm 
? Energy Risk Management and Electricity Restructuring 
? Restructuring and Transmission 
? Market Monitoring 
? Short-Term and Long-Term Approaches: Risk, Congestion Management, Institutional Change 
? Comparative Experiences in Deregulation 
I would like to invite you to participate as a speaker in this conference, in a session tentatively titled ""Short-Term and Long-Term Approaches: Risk, Congestion Management, Institutional Change."" I think the title will evolve, but what I'm going for in this panel is a discussion between you and Betsy Moler (Exelon) about short-run and long-run lessons that we should draw from the California experience. 
If you could let me know soon if you would be able to participate in this conference, I'd be most grateful.  The conference coordinator, Victor Pogostin, would then follow up with a formal letter of invitation. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Regards, 
Lynne

Subject:	Re: California Strategy - 9.5.01  12:00 PM

Rick Simpson from the Speaker's office, said there will be no amendments to the bill prior to its passing the Assembly.  They are still scrambling for votes and sent the Chamber and WSPA lobbyists out to shore up a few while I was in the office.  I talked to Mike Kahl, WSPA lobbyist, whose firm also represents the restaurant assn.  He argued that the 24th was in the bill for awhile and he called all of their clients to tell them to sign up by the 24th.  He said Enron should have done the same.  I argued that Enron did the best it could, but that negotiations with many entities take varying amounts of time.  So long as the date is past, and customers still have to pay exit fees, what was the relevant policy debate.  There can't be a gold rush now.  Scott pointed out to me that bothWendy's and Burger King probably belong to the restaurant assn., so our suggestion is that those entities contact Jot Condie at the assn to instruct his lobbyists to change the date to Sept. 1st.  This is time sensitive.  The Chamber lobbyist would love to see a Sept. 1 date, but was not optimistic that they could move the Governor's office.

Rick agreed to ask the Speaker to call Jeff Brown and ask for a delay until the Legislature has time to act.  He will say the bill is expected to pass his House tomorrow and changes will occur in the Senate which will give them direction.  Rick also expressed pessimism that Bowen's attempts at legislation will have a fruitful result.  I have been unable to speak to Burton directly about calling Brown, but hope to see him before the day is over.

Also I have a call in to Mayor Willie Brown, but so far I haven't heard back.

Jim, re the list of customers signing after July 1 - which ones would be affected by the Aug. 24th date?

I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  

This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and Enron will have.  

I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.

See below.  At our request, EPSA is working on a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R. 2814, the Sawyer-Burr transmission bill that contains voluntary RTO/anti-mandatory RTO provisions.  Please see her question about our views on negotiated transmission rates.  When Jim and I spoke about this when Barton's staff asked for our views on the general concept, we told Barton's staff that there needed to be a recourse rate -- i.e., we can't let the transmission owners only have negotiated rates.  Please advise if there are other points we wish to convey to EPSA in response to her question.  I am pushing them to have a letter to Congress delivered next week when they return to session.

John:
Thanks for the analysis and talking points ? they're great, and I'm incorporating some of it almost verbatim as I'm working on the letter.  We'll get a draft to you soon, so that we can have this letter ready for when Congress returns.

I have one question regarding the Sawyer-Burr bill: in Section 3, there is a paragraph on negotiated rates.  This is basically the same paragraph that was in the draft legislation we discussed in the DeLay meetings in July, and it is also in the Landrieu draft transmission legislation.  What is your interpretation of this negotiated rates section?  I can't think of a situation in which this would be beneficial to transmission users, and I can't really figure out how this would even work in an RTO.

After talking to a couple of regulatory people, all I can think is that this section is meant for the benefit of transmission owners who are thinking in an Order 888-type system, where it could be possible for individual transmission owners to negotiate a rate deal, if this provision were enacted.

Any feedback?

This note follows up on our discussion at the EPSA Leg. Affairs
Committee meeting last week.  We very much appreciate EPSA's willingness
to send a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R.
2814, the Sawyer-Burr legislation introduced on August 2nd, as part of a
broader effort to educate committee members about the serious problems
with this legislation.

First, as we discussed, while the overall transmission thrust of the
bill is largely acceptable, there are two major problems: (1) there are
anti-RTO/pro-voluntary RTO ""nuggets"" (see below) and (2) the bill has
the old or old, old NERC reliability language.

The anti-RTO/pro-voluntary RTO ""nuggets"" are as follows:

	1.	Sec. 3 (transmission pricing) (page 5).  You will note
that the bill says that the required FERC transmission pricing
regulations shall provide incentives to utilities to promote voluntary
RTOs without having the effect of forcing utilities to join RTOs; the
regulations shall limit pancaking, but not during a reasonable
transition period, and in any event, transmission rates can be based on
a single utility's costs.

	2.	Sec. 6 (voluntary development of RTOs) (starting on page
40).  The bill requires FERC to approve RTOs where the participation is
voluntary.  Of particular note is page 40, lines 21-23, which says that
the form, structure and operating entity of the RTO must be approved by
the participating utilities.  At a minimum, this language gives the
utilities a veto over other market participants.  This could also be
read as saying the utilities and only the transmitting utilities make
these critical governance decisions without participation by others.
The section prohibits FERC from conditioning any order under the Federal
Power Act on a utility transferring operational control of facilities to
an ISO or RTO.

Second, we agreed that some talking points are needed to include in the
letter and in our lobbying.  A review of the rest of the bill shows that
we can actually use the general thrust of the bill against the sponsors
as follows below.  We need to let them ""save face"" by separating the
pro-transmission system features of the bill from the anti-RTO language.
Please let me know if EPSA wishes to write a draft for review or whether
you wish us to supply one.  The suggested talking points are:

	a.	EPSA welcomes the bill's acknowledgment of the
importance of improving the transmission system generally and the
critical role of RTOs in particular (e.g., sec. 7 of the bill has a
central role for RTOs in siting of key transmission lines);

	b.	EPSA agrees that transmission pricing is important to
providing incentives to improve the transmission system;

	c.	However, EPSA also believes that it is inappropriate to
tie FERC's hands on RTOs in the name of improving the system when
reducing FERC's authority will make it harder, not easier, to improve
the transmission system; FERC tried a voluntary approach to RTOs and it
has been painfully slow; RTOs need to be of a size and configuration
that parallels natural trading markets and power flows; and this is not
a federal v. state issue as regions exist and would be encouraged under
the bill, the real question is what type of regions (perhaps this latter
point goes before the one on size and scope);

	d.	Congress can address the transmission pricing and siting
issues without the voluntary RTO language.

	e.	Point out the problems with the NERC reliability
language.

Let me know how EPSA wishes to proceed.  We strongly recommend that the
final letter go out next week so it is received as Congress returns from
the August Recess.

Thanks.

It's really an ""either - or"" situation in that either the bid is set up to request wholesale power with the utility retaining the customer or as a retail transaction in which we bid for the customers.  The only way to have both is if we allow the utilities to decide this issue themselves, in which case, FE, DPL and Allegheny will go the wholesale route and AEP and Cinergy will go the retail route.  The problem is also giving too much control to the utilities to game the outcomes in favor of their perceived business interests and those of their affiliates.  EES obviously wants it to be retail.  And from an ENA perspective, the wholesale power delivered under the utilities' proposals would have to be load-shaped, which may not interest ENA as much.  We are in the EES vs. ENA question, but under my reading of the statute, it requires a retail bid as my comments indicate.

At the conclusion of the meeting on competitive bidding, parties were encouraged to file comments at the PUCO.  Below is a draft that reflects the subjects discussed and where I think we ought to land, based on our meeting earlier this week.  I would like to file these soon, so please get back to me.

In the meeting there was a lot of discussion on the RFP process.  Of course the utilities wanted to be able to draft the RFP, choose the winning bidder, have their affiliates participate in the process and have very scanty PUCO oversight, all of which I fought vigourously.  I was asked however if Enron could provide info on what should and should not be in an RFP.  On the should part, I said we could probably provide some insights, but that the should not category would probably be a ""I know it when I see it"" call.  Having said that, any input on this question would be appreciated.

To confirm earlier conversations and associated action items with respect to PECO Physical Customers (listed below on spreadsheet):

(1)	W/ Brenda: Rejection lists for PJM currently include Cheltenham (Simon) and Lehigh Valley Dairies (Suiza).  These will be pulled from the PJM list.  Suiza is already accounted for on the GNO reject list, Simon is currently not on the reject list (status is pending).
(2)	Jim Steffes: On point for letter to PECO to indicate that we would not object to placing these 15 sites on bundled POLR service.
(3)	Michelle: Has confirmed that DeDASR action for contracts not on reject list (Simon and Macerich) will not affect rights under contract (this would merely represent exercise of EES supply option).
(4)	Next Step: Evan-since all of the contracts here are either on reject list, or are associated with Simon/Macerich (which will not be affected by D-DASR action) we need to initiate DeDASR activities for all 15 sites immediately after our motion to reject the first batch of contracts is filed.

Thanks,
Dale


__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 Berney & Dale,

The attached spreadsheet indicates the fifteen (15) accounts in the PJM Control Area that EESI currently delivers physical power to.  The fifteen (15) accounts are all behind PECO Energy Company.  Most of the contracts were ""commodity only"" deals that have expired, with the exception of American College which expires 01/31/2002.  

The other accounts are behind bundled outsource deals (i) Simon Properties (Cheltenham Shopping & SDG Macerich Properties) and (ii) Suiza Foods (Lehigh Valley Dairies) and (iii) Prudential Insurance Companies.

Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Update:

1.  GAS - All sales customers have been reviewed, and we believe the list is ready to go, pending a final review by Janet and Don.  All has been transmitted (copy attached) to Marshall Turner.  We are still lacking any SUPPLY contracts that need to be rejected, but should have it in the morning.

2.  POWER -  All sales customers except for 6 have been identified.  We have transmitted (copy attached) all information with the exception of these 6 to Marshall Turner.  We work tomorrow on resolving the 6, and will provide the data to Marshall at that time.  Of course, these schedules are subject to a final review by Janet and Rogers.

3.  NON-STANDARD DEALS - I do not have an update from last night, and per Marshall Turner, he has not received any additional schedules from Michelle since yesterday (Mondy, 12/17).  What is the status of this filing?


As a reminder, I need the current support from each group for the analysis and reason for rejection.  As we agreed in the meeting this morning, Janet has asked that I be on point for gathering and retaining this.  Please forward me your matrices that suppor this rejection filing.

Janet:  As Outlook was down most of today, I don't think anyone was able to get you the Power matrix.  I do not have the most current one, but I have attached the one as of last Friday to provide you the format.  

Per discussion with Marshall this evening, the motion is being reviewed internally at Weil, Gotshal, and he will keep us posted tomorrow on filing status.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Jim,

I apologize for taking so long to get back to you on this.

As I said during our call last week, I have not ever seen an invoice before.  As I recal from this summer, Stokes kept me posted on the fiscal/tax crisis in TN but I did not ask them to do so explicitly.  As I understood it, I was one of a number of clients they were keeping posted.  They were well aware that we no longer owned the 2 plants and thus were no longer taxpayers.  The work that I requested in covering the Energy Working Group meetings during the late summer and fall.  Also, they represent Tenaska and possibly Calpine and Allegheny and should be splitting those expenses among us.

I've stopped trying to understand the Utilities in California and what they want - it hurts too much.  But yes, the law allows the Utilities to continue to collect ""something"" from customers, including DA customers, for QF costs beyond 3/31/02.

Let me make sure I understand this.  Prior to April 2002, the UDCs want their QF costs to be as low as possible, since this will cause the PX credit to be lower and thus the positive CTC higher.  However, beginning April 2002, they pray for just the opposite -- the greater their QF costs, the more they can collect from DA customers to help pay for the QFs.
 
I truly hope I have misunderstood you, else my brain may explode.

As Sue highlights below, when people talk about stranded costs ending no later than 3/31/02, they are only speaking about generation-related stranded costs.  Above market costs for QFs will be ""collected"" from DA customers for some time into the future.  Wanted to make sure that this was clear.

Subject:        RE: Summary or PX Credit Proposals 

An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9:  SCE said that it has TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesn't know what to charge for DWR. Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-related CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that will return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the ""market"".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE""s advice letter approaches, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some different PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they have a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (making it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollected while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surcharge.  The half cent addition is for 12 months.

Subject:        Summary or PX Credit Proposals 


I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything.  

Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues associated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve Swain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is to have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th.  

Current Issues: 
1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undetermined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)

2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not) 
3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised PX credits 

4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D 
5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charges), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions

6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE 


The four proposals are as follows: 

SCE Recommended Approach 
        This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 18, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the  gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed.   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no    generation/commodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent)  will be applicable to Direct Access customers.  

        Enron would request the following: 
        1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC 
        2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an ""allowable claim"" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possible.  

        3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument 
        4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent   level. 

        5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if/when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC 

        Other consideration: 
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


PG&E Recommended Approach 
        This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January 18, 2001 would include an ""avoided cost""  component.  This avoided cost  

        component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDWR purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchases.        This resulting ""avoided cost"" would be used in lieu of the PX clearing price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDWR purchase  costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embedded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation.  

        
        Enron would request the following: 
        Same as above 

        Other Consideration: 
        Enron  would continue to be exposed to ""price"" risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would hamper     Enron's ability         to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio. 

Hybrid Approach 
        This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from January 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is         applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal. 

        Enron would request the following: 
        Same as SCE and PG&E approach 

        Other considerations: 
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


Enron Model 
        This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 and SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.   

        Enron would request the following: 
        It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial is        the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   However, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the ""value""    Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and CPUC.

        Other considerations: 
        This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge ""price"" risk, but this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated with the     actual collection of the PX credit.


Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we concluded in Wednesday's meeting. 

Thanks, 
Wanda Curry

Jim,

If I heard you right yesterday, you said that Phil Harris was exasperated and couldn't understand why NYISO was so resistant to joining a Northeast RTO.  

From my NY expereince I can tell you a perfect example of the NY attitude toward the merger, if you recall Charleton Heston at an NRA meeting last year, expressed the sentiment, ""not unitl you pry it from my cold dead hand!"", I am sure this is the same feeling the folks in NY have toward their joining PJM... For years, we in NY felt that we where far ahead of PJM as far as technology and operating policies.  Now that PJM has a customer centric management, much improved technology and is the darling of FERC, I'm sure the NYISO staff is struggling with understanding why.  If things were reversed, PJM encouraged to join the NYISO, I'm sure NY would be very pleased...and maybe Phil Harris would be happy (but somehow I doubt that).  Recently I spoke to a friend of mine from NY who said they had a staff meeting where Bill Muesler told the staff, that the only reason that the market participants like the PJM model, is because they can game it and make money, while stating that NY will not give up the effort (to remain independent).  I think this illustrates the general attitude of the NY management and the struggle PJM is in for, unless of course FERC Orders the merger, which I think is the only way this can be accomplished.

I'm sure you most likely know most of this, but just thought I'd pass this along.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Today after the Hearing I attended lunch with John Anderson and Phil Harris.  One of the primary points of discussion involved what to do to respond to the NERC legislative efforts?

Basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over reliability to FERC made sense for all of the groups.  Agreeing to that, the idea is to review the Bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to that language.   

I think that internally Enron is already there???  John Shelk, if you could pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that would be very helpful.

I'll let you know how we next proceed.  If anyone has any problems, please let me know.

Subject:	Draft Decision on DWR Revenue Requirement

The Commission issued a draft decision yesterday (September 4) on DWR's
revenue requirement.  While the Commission had been scheduled to vote on the
revenue requirement at tomorrow's (September 6) meeting, the vote has been
postponed to allow for comments on the PD.  Comments are due on September
11th.  Cmmr. Lynch stated at her press conference held today that it  was
her intent to vote on the PD no later than the next regularly scheduled
Commission meeting on September 20th, and perhaps earlier if a continuation
meeting can be scheduled.


The PD approves the entirety of DWR's requested revenue requirement of $12.6
less the costs of certain demand side management programs which are not
included as ""authorized costs"" under AB1X.  The PD does not follow DWR's
approach of a pro rata allocation of the revenue requirement among the three
UDCs.  Rather the PD follows a ""cost of service"" approach.  The PD allocates
DWR's energy procurement costs on a geographic basis, depending on whether
the energy is delivered over facilities in northern California or Southern
California (Transmission Path 15 is the line of demarcation).  Energy
sources procured north of Path 15 are allocated to PG&E customers and those
procured south of Path 15 are allocated to SCE and SDG&E customers.  The
result of such allocation is to have 54% of DWR costs allocated to PG&E, 33%
to SCE and 13% to SDG&E.  Each of the UDCs are then allocated the same
percentage of bond proceeds.  In revenue requirement terms this means that
for the period of January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002, PG&E is
allocated $6.53 billion; SCE is allocated $4.01 billion and SDG&E is
allocated $1.53 billion.

Along with the revenue requirement allocation, the PD adopts a DWR charge
for each UDC.  The UDCs are directed to begin dispersing payment to DWR
based on the relevant DWR charge for each kWh sold by DWR to the UDC's
customer.  For PG&E this charge is 13.99 cents/ kWh; for SCE the charge is
10.03 cents/kWh; and for SDG&E the charge is 9.02 cents/kWh.  The PD also
notes that given the fact that PG&E's DWR charge is  !3.99 cents it may need
to remit to DWR an additional 4  cents for each kWh that was provided to its
customers by DWR since June 1 until this order becomes effective.

As for the necessity of raising PG&E and SCE rates to account for the DWR
revenue requirement, the PD states that such a determination cannot be made
until a decision on the revenue requirement for the UDCs' retained
generation is issued.  That proposed  decision is due out later this month.



If you have any questions or would like a copy of the order, please contact
me.

Subject:	Eon in the US; NExt Steps

Tom:

Just to recap what we discussed to make sure I understand.

Next Steps

1. You have asked counsel from Akin, Gump to analyse the possible options we may have to intervene at a the federal regulatory level in the Eon take-overs. Possible avenues are the FERC and the SEC. I understand that you and she will also carefully examine any options we mave via the USTR - which may prove to be our strongest hand. She will provide you with an assessment of the various options and risks to these options in the course of the next week or so. As you know, Andreas and I have spoken to Steffes, Shapiro, and Frevert - all of whom were supportive of this idea and so no marked risk to our relationship with Eon or possible 

2. Akin Gump  will also file an intervention on our behalf with the FERC re the Eon acquisition of LG&E by no later than cob Monday to provide us with a place holder in the proceedings should we wish to act. We will jointly contact Shaw on Monday to 
let him know that this is being done. 

3. Building from our meetings in Washington, Russ Kean from Kissinger and Associations will draft up an initial ""political leverage"" program which would cover the following:  

what goals we might realistically achieve by engaging senior US politicians in the issue of energy market opening in Germany and equal treatment for American companies; 
what key messages would we want to develop to generate high-level political interest in this; 
what politicians and decision-makers should we want to approach, how should the messages be presented, and how can we galvanise political action (possible targets would be the US Trade Rep,. the White House/ VP Cheney, key members of Congress, US Assistant Secretaries at State and possibly Commerce, and local politicians in Kentucky)

4. You and I can then pull this material together into a coherent presentation for Eric and other senior folk in London to present the program of how, in a graduated fashion, we can apply increasing pressure on Eon to seek their co-operation and or acquiesance in regulatory areas such as unbundling, regulated TPA, and reciprocity as well as  commercial issues such as tolling agreements, and  long-term interconnector capacity. Mark Frevert has offered to raise any of this with Harig (head of Eon) if and when we want.   

5. On a parallel path, we will continiue to get the message out that the German market is not open and US firms are suffering when John meets with the Congressional Delegation in Berlin next week and a meeting slated with the new US Ambassador (Coates) in Berlin later in September.

Missing Items:

1. Do we have interest in also developing a PR angle to this program? It may be a bit premature, but, if so, we would need to work with Enron's PR agency to develop the messages we would want to get out, the vehicles for doing so, the localities to hit, and the follow-up.  

2. We still need more detail from (Shaw, Thompson, and Radmacher) on exactly what their commercial priorities are and how to balance these with regulatory objectives. 

3. An assessment for options at the state regulatory level. 

4. Have meetings yet been set up with USTR? This is a key pressure point.

Let me know what other thoughts you may have and let's talk tomorrow afternoon.
Thanks, Paul

Subject:	PX Credit Calculations and Comments

Attached is a Word document with my notes from the PG&E meeting last Thursday August 1.
I am also including an Excel spreadsheet that shows how the PX credit is calculated under the various methods that have been discussed.

My conclusion is:
PG&E continues to make unpredictable and arbitrary decisions without applying with the CPUC.  If not for the PX receivable, I would recommend an immediate protest to halt this behaviour.
They are also bending the existing rules so far as to strain credibility.

The SCE method of calculating a PX credit is the best choice both from a logical perspective and does not require an adjustment to our mark.  (Again, setting aside the PX receivable issue.)  Many external parties support it, the CPUC is heading in this direction.
It makes sense because it keeps DA customers paying for the services they use, i.e. T&D.
DA may be getting a ""break"" to the extent the current generation rate pays for ""past sins"", i.e. if market prices are below embedded generation plus the 3-cent surcharge.  This is where a yet-to-be determined nonbypassable CTC may come from.

Setting the PX credit equal to the Market Price is unlikely to be approved, on a go-forward basis.  If PX Credit = Market, the  DA customer will only pay frozen rates.  Although this confirms to AB1890 since the rate freeze is not technically over, it is unlikely that this will go forward since:
bundled customers are paying more than rate-freeze rates
there is no agreed-upon market price

Jim,

Next week is the annual DSTAR meeting.  Our dues will be due on Sept 11, the fee is $250.00.  If there is no problem I plan on writing a check, obtaining a receipt and putting this charge on my expense report.  I just found out about this requirement, hence the late notice to you.  If there is any problem, please let me know.

FYI, the benefits that Enron would receive from this would be the ability to run for a place on the Advisory Board, which I am doing.  The Advisory Board works directly with the (currently not-so) independent DSTAR Board.  If anything, it gets us close to the ears of the decision makers and I would expect that after the TO's file in October the Board may regain some of their much needed independence, at which point we'd be in a good position to influence policy.

Kind Regards,

Subject: FW: Federal Register notices - 417R Changes


The DOE is requesting comments from industry regarding proposed changes to an EIA form EIA-417R for reporting ""Electric Power System Emergency Report"".  This is being revised to become EIA-417 ""Electric Emergency Incident and Disturbance Report"".  Reporting will be reduced from the existing >3300 entities to approximately 200 control area operators, RTOS, and Security Coordinators.   

However, ""Any utility, businesss entity, or energy concern that participates in the electric power industry could be notified by DOE that it needs to provide technical information concerning a particular incident.""

There are a series of questions in the notice (attached) directed towards those responsible for providing responses to the form and those utilizing the data.

NERC is developing a response to these forms and I anticipate that many of their utility members will point out that the traders and IPPs need to be included due to the interdependency on the market/trading systems for energy supply.

For the control area data, I ask that Keith and Lloyd review the new form since we are still operating a control area.

I will track the NERC comments - and if need be, may ask Dan Watkiss to draft comments to DOE to protect our interests.

I assume you're all over this, Linda.

On the off chance that you haven't seen it.  Feinstein is asking IEP for comments on her draft legislation that would increase regulation of natural gas, define what just and reasonable rates would be and increase refund power on the electric side.  I think we would have some concerns with her proposal.  If you want to pass along our comments to IEP, just get them to me.

DATE: September 25, 2001

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's "" Four RTO policy"" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 ""the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.""  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called ""NIMBA virus"".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to ""reliability standards.""  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

Christi, hi -- we spoke about a month ago. I'm working with Michael Burr to pull together an article for our customers on what's going on with RTOs. I know you and Sarah have been involved in the hearings, and that we don't want to comment during this 45-day period. But we will publish in late September and I feel Mike really needs your input in a couple of areas:

1. Why are the states and the proposed RTOs fighting FERC's order so fiercely? And why won't the RTOs being proposed work?
2. There is some confusion as to whether RTO formation is still voluntary. Is it?
3. Can you suggest any source within FERC who can articulate the commission's thinking?
4. Do you see a likely scenario or timetable emerging?

This article is a great chance to talk to our customers about this issue. Please let me know if you can provide some help.

Thanks,
Jeannie

"RE: NERC and Terrorism","Charles --

After our conversation today, I thought that I'd outline some Q&A topics for you to consider --

1.	How does NERC define ""security""? (important to differentiate between national security and system security).
2.	What is NERC's role in national security?
3.	Will RTOs degrade national security?  system security?
4.	What does Enron think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps?
5.	Does Enron oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?

This Q&A should not be released to the public.  I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.

Thanks.

Subject:	RE: NERC and Terrorism

We need to discuss in our Tuesday Call.

1) Who is the intended audience of these points? NERC? or outside NERC about NERC?  The message has to be tailored to the audience.

There are people in various places DOE, NERC, NIPC, some utilities, that feel empowered by the events. We do not want to belittle their concerns, we want to expose them to ridicule when they do not use their brain,

NERC is still the only game in town, We need to guide them to be truly impartial in the electric utility restructuring, but also be ready to expose the abuse of their Information monopoly position.

Do we work from within? or launch our missiles to attack their standing?

What is the role of the MIC in regards to this issue within NERC?


2) Central Repository of Data. I wanted to discuss this point to determine if we should lobby to strengthen this system or let it die through neglect?. The key is that the institution that hold access to this information has power.

3) Actions with DOE. The one that was more concerning to me, is the perspective of some coordinators to ""play it conservatively""; I interpret it as, refusing to schedule some market transactions.

4) RTOs. Tom Bowe of PJM blasted the NERC staff  at the meeting when he got hold of the Energy Daily article.

Subject:	RE: NERC and Terrorism

Charles,

Some comments.  I removed some words I though made NERC look too respectable/official, embellished some of your points, added a section on RTO security risk, and added some stronger ""chastisement"" words at the end.  They may be too strong, but I think the paper needs to be assertive.  Out of curiosity, is there an intended audience?  If it is NERC, maybe the more passive approach is preferable, but if it is anyone else, then maybe the aggressiveness would be a good thing. I think we want to make sure the audience finishes by looking at NERC and shaking their head in disgust, rather than sighing and shrugging their shoulders.  Of course, that could backfire and make us look like we're unfairly attacking NERC without any provocation, especially given the esoteric nature of some of our points.

Thoughts?

Subject:	California Update--08.27.01

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those ""involuntarily"" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the ""effective date"" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

"RE: State and Federal Energy Efforts - Implications","Rogers --

FERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of ""security"" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.  I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.  I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.  FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.  

Retail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.  Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.

Thanks.

Subject:	State and Federal Energy Efforts - Implications

Several articles in todays publications discuss possible implications to federal and state initiatives.  Bill Wicker, spokesman for Senate Energy Committee mentioned that it was too early to determine how energy policy might be affected.  INGAA's Halvorsen  hinted at a probable  policy shift - more focus on energy security for the time being.  Any information or insights would be helpful.  I was already feeling as though ERCOT implementation would be delayed given the disastrous pilot performance and am now even more convinced.  Arkansas just recommended a complete shelving of their deregulation initiatives.  These types of issues will have a significant impact on our current book of business as well as future decisions.

Thanks,

Subject: Crestone (NBP) in Denver


Several weeks ago while in Denver I had the opportunity to meet with Brian Bierbach, Dan Bump and Don Baldridge at Crestone (I was with my husband who has met with these individuals before).  They told me that they are having some pretty significant government affairs issues, particularly related to the substantial discharge of water associated with coal bed methane extraction.  
 
To what extent can/should we support their efforts, if at all?  It seems to me that our closer association with them may give us more visibility and access in the Rocky Mountain region (assuming that this is desirable).  Does it make sense to explore this further?
 
I appreciate your feedback.  
 
Thanks,

"Regulatory and Other Market Obligations","Janet --

Going forward Govt Affairs will coordinate with Services and Product Development (and other EWS and EES groups as appropriate, e.g. Credit) to ensure compliance with (1) licensing/registration, (2) bonding/security, (3) regulatory reporting, and (4) other.  I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).

I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.

In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.

I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.

Thanks,

Jim

PS - I'll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status.

We are not managing bonds, etc.  This is a market entry requirement and should be documented by Product Development/Services upon entering new markets.  We had a meeting earlier this week with Vicki Sharp and came to general agreement that this was a Services/Regulatory maintenance requirement.  Will follow up and make sure they are pulling this together.  This is one of the issues I have been hammering on re: new product development/new market entry - I want proof of all data requirements/costs/license requirements/processes before new products are released and markets are entered.  In the past, I believe sign offs have occurred without a complete understanding of the requirements.  I have refused to sign any new products until Product Development can prove the above exists - even for markets where we are already doing business.

Subject:	IMPORTANT: Illinois - Creditworthiness Issues

Unlike TX, creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers (ARES) in IL is not uniform accross utility lines. The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.

Enron's Credit Rating of BBB(S&P), and Baa2(Moody's)
General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.

Registration Under SubPart B:
EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications
	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB- (Duff 	& Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or

	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 
	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES' revenue for last fiscal year; or
	
	3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES's revenue for the last fiscal year; or

	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES' contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or
	
	5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an ""A"" rated financial 	insitution; or
	
	6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.

Enron's Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody's), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.

IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES's ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.

Single Bill Option:
Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:
	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO

	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an ""A"" rating

	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB-(duff &Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)
	
	4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.
Enron's Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp's current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. 

Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.

IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.

Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)
Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month's estimated IFC charges for all EES' customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES' customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.

If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.

IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP's service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.

Jim,
First let me introduce myself.  I work for Mark Courtney and manage the Enron Direct Mid Market gas group in Long Beach, CA.  Mark suggested I contact you regarding the following issue:

We have received a letter from the above mentioned customer complaining that they were misled during contract negotiations and that resulted in them signing a contract with prices that are much too high.  I am contacting you because in this letter they make reference to contacting the FERC 'to investigate possible manipulation of the natural gas market'.  Paul Darmitzel in legal is reviewing the letter and drafting a response to this letter.

Since I only have a hard copy of the letter I need your fax number.  Please advise if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Thanks,
David Hensel
Director - Enron Direct West

Subject:	EPSA Paper on Market Based Rates

I sat in on the EPSA call on market based rates on Friday.  As you know, the Commission has on its agenda for tomorrow a new proceeding entitled ""Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations"" (presumably being done under the Commission's section 206 authorization).  EPSA realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the Commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for Lynn Church to release if, after seeing what the Commission has in mind, the investigation will apply to all holders of market based rates.  The press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and (assuming the Commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists.

I have a call in to EPSA to see if I can get any more details about what the press release will say.  Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for the press release.   I'll let everyone know what comes out of the FERC meeting as soon as I find out.

Subject:        Re: ERCOT - Problems with the New Market 

We do need a formal plan.  We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions. Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.  We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.  Grand-standing is ignored.  Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored.  Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.   

Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations.  Thane and I also visited with him. 

Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed.  (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)  

Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments.  We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.  There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.  The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.  Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel.  The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.  Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.   

Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone.  I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet? Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.  I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then?  You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft.  Thanks, Jean

Jean & Thane -- 

Walking out last night, Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets.  

Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes.  

If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood.  As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market.  Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.

Jean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation.  I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am.  I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick's budget meeting.

It would be helpful to get a further report from Marchris.  Tauzin is likely to send an anti-RTO letter to FERC soon based on the letter from the LA PSC and from lobbying by Entergy, with whom he is very close since they are  based in New Orleans and have been his biggest and longest supporters.  Apparently, Entergy asked him for legislation to block FERC but he has said no electricity legislation will be taken up this year.  Tauzin's folks are saying a letter of some kind is a fallback that is designed to  be responsive to LA PSC and Entergy without hurting us as much as legislation.

Subject:	Comments on CalPX letter to FERC, dated Aug. 10, 2001 

Richard,

Here are a few comments on the CalPX letter to FERC outlining the difficulties in calculating PX refunds.  

1.  The PX claims it is a ""neutral party in this proceeding"" and is only a conduit for cash.  True for PX business, not true for CAISO obligations.  The CAISO holds SC's responsible for non-payment, not the SC's customers.  The PX was the SC for most of the transactions going through the day-ahead and hour-ahead market.  Therefore, the PX is primarily liable.  I'm not sure how this helps us, though, since the PX has no money.  

2.  Page 3, SC Data.  I was unaware that the CalPX acted as SC until February 28th---one month after it closed the doors on January 31st.  During this time, the CAISO was probably in violation of its Tariff, which requires SCs to be creditworthy.

3.  Page 5.  Commandeered contracts.  What is the status of the PX's claim against the State of California?  The State owes the PX, as representative for its Participants, the mark-to-market value of the contracts on January 31st, less amounts paid by CDWR to suppliers.  If the PX won't bring this claim, its bankruptcy trustee or the PX Participants should bring this claim against the State of Califonria.

4.  Pages 3 and 4.  $150 Breakpoint.  I asked Kit Blair in Volume Management to review this letter and he said that it was his view and the view of two other folks in VM that the PX is vastly overstating the difficulty in calculating the $150 breakpoint.  His view was that it should take hours or days, but not weeks.  However, I do not see how we get an advantage from accelerating the calculation of refunds.

Finally, according to reports from Credit and VM, the remaining PX employees are not exactly the ""A-team.""   I suggest we should ask FERC to require the PX to document its methodology for calculating refunds, so that we can review for errors.  Spot audits by independent auditors might be a good idea, too.

Steve

Subject:	Pennsylvania $147,000 EES Assessment

EES was recently assessed $147,000 by the Pennsylvania PUC as a method of recovering their costs.  Enron's local PA attorney, Kevin Moody of Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, notified us that he has taken the lead for a group of natural gas suppliers to challenge the assessments and inquired if Enron wanted to be a part of the group.  The group includes IOGA (an association of oil & gas suppliers in PA), TXU, Hess, New Power, and 4 others.  Moody successfully got a postponement of the payments until Oct 16.  EES is included in the postponement at this time.  The options are to litigate the assessment (Moody feels we are on solid ground to prevail) or to negotiate a settlement with the PUC where we agree to some assessment to be determined.  Litigating the assessment could cost about $50K - $60K (in addition to the $25K to date) whereas settling would obviously be less expensive initially but would provide an assessment for each year going forward.  Moody id meeting with the PA PUC this Friday to determine what would be the best way to proceed (he is hoping to convince them that the statute is quite clear that they cannot make the assessment and that they withdraw it).  We will have a better grasp of the situation and clearer path for the direction we should pursue after that meeting.  I will keep you informed.

The paper is, for the most part, a fair representation of the NURF discussions ( I'd part with a few of the statements made in 6, 7, & 8).   While the ETS pipelines participated in the development of the outline to ensure that the principles were sound, we do not have any present plans to file a NURF service.  When and if we have real customers that want to contract for NURF service, we will make a filing.   Even though we don't plan any immediate NURF service, I think the dialogue was still useful in making sure that generators understand the operational challenges of serving hourly swings.

This study also concludes that due to the inelasticity of demand, there needs to be a great deal of sellers (more than in a typical market) to ensure competitive markets.  I am not sure that we want to use this study for our purposes; however, need to be aware it is out there as we discuss any new methods of assessing market power.  Do we need to conduct our own study?

Subject:	Cornell University Experiment on Market Prices

Cornell has published a report of 4 experiments conducted to test market trading behavior and its impact on electricity prices under different price auctions. 

1) uniform price auction
2) uniform price with interruptible loads
3) discriminative auction - generators are paid their actual offers
4) soft-cap auction 

The study is fascinating as real subjects were employed and paid real dollars based on their trading performance.  The findings are consistent with our arguments against price caps - particularly soft caps as installed in California.   I think there is some ""empirical"" data that can be used in our arguments against price caps.  

More variations of the auctions aimed at testing some assumptions used in these 4 experiments are planned, and industry is invited to participate in the experiments.

Subject: RE: Well-Designed RTO


Janel,
 
The paper is OK.
 
My only comments would be, as far as an RTO offer non-discriminatory access to transmission, I think without the word ""comparable"" the Participating Transmission Owners (PTOs) of the proposed westConnect would say, yes, they offer non-discriminatory access...to whatever is left over after they distribute the majority of the rights to the incumbants!  Is that comparable, in my opinion no, which is one of the reasons why I inserted the word comparable.  I can see where that may be nit-picking, but that was my reason for adding it.
 
As far as my comment about Governance.  The governance of WestConnect, a for-profit TransCo, is severely biased to the favor of the PTOs.  Perhaps it is just their version of a for-profit Transco that is not favorable to other market-participants, but I would be cautious in citing a for-profit RTO as a preferred model, a for-profit Transco operating within a non-profit - Independent RTO, seems to be a more reasonable.  But these judgements are based on my understanding of the WestConnect.
 
Kind Regards,
 
Dave

Jim, Dave and Steve - 
 
Thank you very much for the feedback and edits to the Well-Designed RTO paper.  I've made the bulk of the changes you suggested except for the section on page 1 - Which constitutes a well-designed institutional structure for an RTO?
 
Each of you had significant issues with this section.  I get the feeling that we should eliminate it altogether but want to clear that with you before I do so.  Do you have alternative suggestions?  
 
Other than that particular section, I would really appreciate if you reviewed the attached one more time (with the changes that were made) and let me know if you are comfortable with how it is evolving.
 
thank you.

Thanks for all of your support, professionalism and friendship over the past 4 years.  I will look back on my time here with fond memories, especially our battles in Pennsylvania!!   We had some great victories, didn't we (although I learned from you that I should ""declare victory no matter what the outcome"")?   We had some losses, too, but defeat makes the victories sweeter.  We've all been through the good, the bad, and the ugly together.  And I'm sure that I'll never work with a more talented group of people.  

Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, and this decision has not been an easy one to make.  The only thing that makes it easier is that I know that our paths will cross again.

EPMI is the QSE.  As long as our customers don't mind that we are deciding their congestion charges internally, then this should work.  My concern was that our customers would balk at Enron deciding how much of our costs they should pay?

We should have no problem with the pass through of congestion in Texas.  The QSE receives a charge for our entire load and then allocates it to our load of a pro rata basis.  We then pass through these costs to the customer.  This is the same way we do things in the NE and the only way we can pass through intrazonal congestion.  If you would like to discuss this further, please give me a call at 33143. Thanks.

Attached for review and comment is a draft set of talking points on the Barton RTO discussion draft.  I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft.  You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents: (1) that FERC is rushing and being heavy-handed and (2) that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities (i.e., no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedy).

Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days.  Once Capitol Hill is up and running again, we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to members/staff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion draft's treatment of RTOs.

Subject: RE: Motion of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-E) for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Order Shortening Time


Summary first, comments second.
 
Short read of SDGE proposal:

Plan establishes procurement and recovery strategy for SDGE as standard offer provider post Jan 1, 2003.  Procurement plan would be submitted annually for PUC approval with ongoing discussions to allow modifications to plan as needed. 
Supply side of plan comes from URG (SONGS, QFs, PGE and other bilateral contracts - about 1/4 of total requirement), state resources (DWR and CPA), and market purchases (short and long term, fixed and variable, peaking) in that order.  -     SDGE takes no responsibility for administering state-owned resources.  Takes only what is needed and not obligated to take anyting more.  Long term products procured through RFPs. 
-    Most details of portfolio kept confidential, except load forecast and RFP process. 
Demand side of plan is load forecast, net of DA load. 
-     DA load is identified through 90 day open enrollment period that starts 180 days before procurement plan is submitted.  Over 20 kW customers commit to 5 year departure.  Smaller customers commit to 1 year departure.  
-    Departing customers pay exit fee for DWR and URG costs.  Premature returns pay re-entry fee and spot pricing.
-    Departures not official until PUC rules on the procurement plan. 
Cost recovery through a PCAM (Procurement Cost Adjustment Mechanism).  Two components - energy (including ancillary services), and a balancing account adjustment component.
-    each component is adjusted monthly. 
Other policy gems thrown out for discussion:
-    State must maintain strong procurement role; e.g. administer DWR contracts, consider combining generating assets under State portfolio management
-    PA-style auction of standard offer, with departing customers treated the same as DA.

Direction of comments (through AReM would seem fine):

Departure should not be limited to open enrollment periods.  During open enrollment, certain amount of load, at least amount that would be supplied by market purchases, should be designated as fee-less.  During other times, departure is permitted with appropriate exit fee. 
Appropriate exit fee must be based on truly unavoidable costs and have not already been recovered through AB 1890 CTCs. 
Re-entry fee should only be required if returning customer wants PCAM.  Otherwise, customer gets spot price and there is no fee. 
5-yr and 1-yr commitment periods mean nothing and should be eliminated.  Returning customers get spot price or buy their way into PCAM. 
Pricing data used for PCAM should not be confidential.  Customers should know their risk exposure when buying PCAM - what's the portfolio, term of contracts, pricing volatility, etc.  Otherwise customer is kept in dark, not knowing pay they are paying for. 
Long term solution is auction or similar disposition of customers to market.  Solution is not for state to take over power plant management.

Sue - let's you and I talk first.  Is AReM going to comment?

Subject: IMPORTANT ! : Motion of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-E) for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Order Shortening Time


Yesterday, SDG&E filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cost recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file comments on the mechanism.  The attached email from SDG&E contains the motion, an executive summary, and a detailed summary of  their proposals and recommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDG&E's customers.  The utility requests a 15-day comment period, which means comments would have to be filed by September 10 (September 8 is a Saturday).  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later.

The filing provides the following discussion of direct access:


  _____  

""Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent to which they might be served instead by third party providers. The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct access and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of an optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commitments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate direct access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E discusses below how to provide for this coordination. 

As the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections will gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct access is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direct access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly half. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avoid paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspend direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, the legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, and other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effect of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause large quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly. 

These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct access and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elections take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided information on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggregation) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is scheduled to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitments to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller customers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the information it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of over- or under-commitment. 

In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of service would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, and, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct access placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to limit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay an exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retained generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining customers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commodity service to departing customers. Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing, again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch.
 
Coordinating direct access with the planning process, at least for a near-term period, is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan.""

  _____  


The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role:

  _____  

""When the State embarked on industry restructuring, one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide. Although California's experience with markets has not been as anticipated, it is still possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regulatory oversight can offer advantages to consumers. In fact, some states have undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers' net short requirements. For example, in parts of Pennsylvania, the State decided to auction off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market. California may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing. If a portion of the net short is auctioned off in this manner, from a planning standpoint, it should be treated the same as direct access: SDG&E will need adequate notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short position remaining to be served, and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fees should also apply.""

  _____  


There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment upon, as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings.  Please let me (and others) know if you agree.

Jim:

Thank you for your thoughtful response.  Even if Enron is a ""hot button""
these days, we remain big fans of yours.

In regard to your comments on the letter, I disagree with some of the
assertions.

First, I am fairly confident that no major piece of energy legislation
will be passed this year.  As you can see from the attached
congressional update for the DE Task Force prepared by Bev Jones (former
VP for Consolidated Natural Gas), Jimmy Hayes (former Member of
Congress, and Nancy Etkin (former head of Natural Gas Vehicle
Coalition), there is every indication that legislation is going to get
bottled up in the Senate.  I agree with the assessment.

Moreover, the legislation that is being considered has almost nothing in
it of direct relevance to ""getting it right"" in regard to restructuring.
Without pressure, I expect no federal leadership on restructuring
issues.  While I do agree that commissions are usually a stalling
tactic, both Ken and I are dismayed at the lack of focus, resources
(i.e., DOE has devoted almost nothing of any sort to restructuring) and
lack of qualified personnel directed at promoting more competition in
the energy market.  While you and I may have some idea of what is
necessary (and that is a stretch for me -- given the complexity of the
challenges), I can safely say the vast majority of folks have no idea
what to do -- especially about the tricky jurisdictional questions
involved.

I personally think one way to craft a ""new federalism"" on restructuring
is to bribe the states into more action.  The federal government does
this with education, housing, etc.  Why not with restructuring?  A
carrot for those states which are moving forward, linked to definite
metrics of progress and openness.

I also strongly believed that state PUCS and federal agencies like FERC
are being pushed to the limit about what they can accomplish given
declining budgets and personnel.  I further think that this slows the
whole process down.  Think about it -- telephone deregulation, a growing
crisis in regard to water, record levels of mergers and acquisitions,
historic changes in regard to natural gas and electric regulation -- all
piled on top of each other for these folks.

Good catch on the numbering of the recommendations cited in the letter.
This has been corrected.

I look forward to seeing you in September at the Board meeting.

Jamie

P.S.   Speaking of the DE Task Force, have you and Bob Frank made a
decision yet to participate?  I hope you do, but I need to know as soon
as possible.

Jamie --

Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am
always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither
I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.

First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your
messages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the proper
focus.

In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national
commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and
Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would
delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against
competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move
away from the commission.

Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that
promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a
distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.

Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will
only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.
While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we
haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working.

Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney
plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no
such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.

If you want to talk, please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	Implementation of the Suspension Direct Access -- UDCs' Plan

On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for
implementing the suspension of direct access.  Parties have until,
Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.

The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek
Commission approval:

1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP
List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.

2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service
Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,
they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,
2001.

3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer
account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party
verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.

4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place
on or before Sept. 20th.

5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.

6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still
under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to
process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.


7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a
merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;
requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if
the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.

8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a
customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).

9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights
to another.

10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a
community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be
allowed.

In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for
implementing the suspension.

1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and
accepted).

2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should
require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off
to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the
Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to
receive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay
from the Commission.

3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was
associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set
forth a proposed affidavit.)

This is the latest status on Howard's effort - PGE is included in the ""in favor"" group in Howard's message - but both Al and I have since let him know he should not include us as being ""in favor"" unless and until we've coordinated this with Enron - I'm relying on you to do that.  Time is very short - Howard needs to be moving on this now if he has any shot at all of influencing the outcome.  While I agree the message ought to be delivered, I'm not optimistic there is time for the legislature to do anything else at this point.  If nothing else, it would be good let the decision makers know that their plan may not have the hoped for result, so they can't say no one told them.  dn

I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding
my email dated August 27, 2001 with respect to the proposal to contact the
Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE.

Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have
suggested that the message is too strong.  Our Ex Officio members BPA and
WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with
addressing the state government on this or other issues.  As you know, I
want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is
possible, and to protect the interests of all members.

Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against
SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for
bankruptcy or litigation.  After all, the Unofficial Committee was organized
to provide a different approach generally.  The purpose of contacting the
Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they
are now considering, which leaves SCE about $1 billion short on the proposed
financing to pay creditors, may cause some other sellers to take precipitous
action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or
arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower $2.9
billion level, which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally.
We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action
will be taken. The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is
not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether, only legislation
that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE.

The tone of the presentation, if we make one, will be low key, non
threatening, and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor
design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy, litigation and other
alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed,
leaving the energy sellers out in the cold.

If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be
associated with the message outlined above, then I propose that we give such
members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and
allowing us, if asked, to identify any such members that prefer not to be a
part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids
litigation and bankruptcy for SCE.  I understand that the LADWP and Coral
Power would like this approach adopted.

As I explained in my prior email, it has been suggested that the proposed
bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor
Day and before the Sept 14 adjournment.  That is why timing is important.
Those of you that have not responed, please respond.  Those of you that were
concerned that the message was unclear, please review this email and
consider or reconsider your positions, as the case may be.

As of right now, there are only 11 votes: 9 in favor and 2 against.  The
polls are still open so please let me know your position.

You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined
that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee
required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee.

"FW: Sue's Retort to SCE's Premise","Sue --

I agree with your arguments.  The other problem with SCE's analysis is that they had a DEFINED stranded cost amount and they deserve that money.  

What California did (my explaination) is that SCE was offered frozen rates for 4 years.  All of the margin they ""earned"" was shareholder's compensation for moving to direct access.  If the total $$ of margin was $0 or less, this implies simply that SCE had no generation stranded costs.  

The entire argument that SCE is making forgets the $Billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate.

Subject: Sue's Retort to SCE's Premise
Importance: High


I don't agree Edison's premise -- that ""direct access customers contributed just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service customers."" We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to buy power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I will explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeoffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their billions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in direct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs alone -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject to any presumed ""undercollection.""

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the retail busness from T&D. So, they did a ""top-down"" calculation.  This meant that there had to be a ""credit"" put on the bills of DA customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA. So, the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the rates.  Next, although bundled customers rates were capped, the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed their tariffs with the CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got nowhere, until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our argument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have thought we had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high. So, we have a legal right to receive the full PX Credit/Negative CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated with bundled customers. It seems as if we should be able to prosecute this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an attorney) 

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

"NG Meeting on Transco","Ashley -

We would prefer (given the schedules) to hold a conference call on Wednesday pm with a group of marketers/generators.  Seems like the easiest way to discuss with everyone.  It would be great to have a paper from NG earlier in the week.  

Here is our list of recommended people.  Probably best to have NG or you call to invite (rather than Enron) to highlight your interest in brokering a deal in the Midwest.

Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter they appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to buyers or they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---

d.	Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these proceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be addressed.  CalPX proposes to use its share-fraction allocation method to determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there are no specific Commission orders on how to allocate the refunds.

"Enron Questions on NG - ARTO","Ashley --

First, hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday.  

Luiz Maurer and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier.  If you have any questions, please call me.

Also, Enron will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).  Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at Enron we needed more time to respond.  Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.

Thanks,

Jim

=============================

1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ? Stage III? Stage IV?

 

2) Regarding document ""Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission"": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive 
consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?

3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other
negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?

4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this ""potential"" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?

5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including ""external"" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?

6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a ""light"" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?

7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a ""self-dispatch"" physical rights model] 

8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. Don't you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?

9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your ""Martix of RTO Functions"" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?

10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?

11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?

12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?

13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models

I am talking with Larry Cafero, Minority leader of House, and close personal friend of the Gov.  Initial feedback from Cafero is still positive.

Did Connecticut reject our fuel cell project? If so, details?
[Allegretti, Daniel]  

Yes.  The DPUC issued a draft decision which declines to fund the project from the Conservation and Load Management Fund.  The decision praises the project in the text but includes a footnote which is critical of the project.  In addition, the DPUC issued a press release which is not helpful in promoting the project.

The decision not to fund out of the C&LM fund was not unexpected.  The chairman of the DPUC has been very supportive, along with Governor Rowland, but has been working offline to fund the project instead from the Renewable Energy Investment Fund.  Although the REIF is a much smaller fund it appears the REIF is able to borrow against future receipts and is willing to do so based in part on their expectation of increased funding next legislative session.  We are meeting with the REIF director next Wednesday to confirm where this stands.

In the mean time we have filed exceptions to the draft decision which goes final tomorrow.  We are told that the offending footnote will be removed but that the decision not to commit the C&LM fund will remain unchanged.

In sum, the project has suffered a very real setback but has not at this time been abandoned by EPMI.  Support from Rowland and others remains strong and EPMI would like to see if funding from the REIF this year is in fact viable.

Subject: Re: Alliance


Dear Stakeholders:

	At last Tuesday's meeting in Chicago, National Grid promised to circulate a draft proposal for the stakeholder advisory process of the Alliance.  The attached document is a draft.  Because of the extraordinary circumstances of this week, Grid was unable to get full corporate review of the document, and may want to  further modify it.  Nevertheless, because of  Grid's desire to fulfill its promise, it is circulating the current version of the document for stakeholders to begin thinking about.

My thoughts.
 
I would change the section ""Reliability"" to ""Operations"".  The Current framework is Non-standardized;  Poor Seams Interface
 
Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that ""Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner.""  Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.
 
Under Generation - I would change ""optional"" to Optimal.
 
I don't also understand the 99%.  Easier to say 100%*   * - Public Power recipricoity issues.
 
Thanks,

Add ""real time"" price
Add costs and ""risk premiums""
Add Generation ""and Transmission""
Add lack of ""valid"" grid information
Change the benefits to ""Better ability for customers to utilize numerous energy products, including forward hedging tools and demand side management.""  [[Which Enron sells!]]
 
Change Market to ""Wholesale Market""  open
 
Also, why do you say 99% open after RTOs?  Is this due to publics that don't participate?  If so, then maybe say ""100% open to the extent that non-jurisdictional entities, such as federal power agencies and state power authorities, participate""  or name some examples, such as TVA and BPA.

That is true in Option A and Option B.  The key to Option C is that we would have January and February meter read cycle to switch our customer before they would be switched to the affilliate as a customer who did not switch.  Option A and B, EES would not possibly get customers in TNMP and AEP if their meters are read during the first two weeks of the month.  We could send switches for Reliant and TXU for the first two weeks of the month, before the December moratorium.  Does this help?

Subject:	RE: Transmission Divesture and Tax Policy

Response to your questions:

1.  I think it would be best if it there were transmission assets only.  Given the geographic scale we want to achieve, adding in the distributions systems is unnecessary and my lead to more perpetuation of the local mentality.  I don't think you get much of a scale benefit from adding in the distribution systems.  The distribution systems are also likely to remain as suppliers of last resort in the event of retail access, which raises complications.  It would be equivalent to an pipeline also being an LDC.  

2.  The divesting company does not get the shares, its shareholders receive them as a direct distribution.  As a result, the old management has no control over the shares of the Transco.  Several utilities (UtilA, UtilB, UtilC, etc) agree to simultaneously spin off their transmission into BigTrans.  The share holders of UtilA get X shares of BigTrans in exchange for Y shares of UtilA and how hold Y fewer shares in UtilA and X shares of BigTrans.  The spin off could also be done as part of a merger.  Both parties agree to spin off their transmission into a common company.  The shareholders would receive publicly traded hares in both UtilA-BCombine and BigTrans.  The managements of both companies being separated from each other.  There would have to be a conflict of interest standard for the board and management of BigTrans, which prohibits any substantial benefit from market operations, just as we have for any other RTO.

A couple questions --

1.	Could the company include distribution wires as well, instead of being just a transmission only wires?
2.	How many shares would a divesting company get?  Could this be more that 5%?  If so, wouldn't this be over the ""control"" threshold?

In general, I fully support this type of action.

Subject:	Transmission Divesture and Tax Policy

Jim, Sarah and Rick,

	The following describes the suggestion that I made in our meeting this morning.  This is a strategy which could only be executed in legislation.  

The Problem:

One of the chief difficulties of forming a Transco are the tax consequences of divestiture of assets. The problem was identified in 1995 when we first started talking about a Transco in the West.   If the parties agree in advance of divesture to combine their assets with others into a new company, the divestiture creates a tax event.  As a result, the Transco's like Alliance or TransConnect have adopted an LLC structure to avoid the tax consequences of formation.  The problem with the LLC form is the reluctance of the owners to surrender all control of their assets to the Managing Member who has ""little skin in the game.""  Questions have also been raised by opponents about the fiduciary responsibilities of Managing Member.  Are they to look out of the financial interests of the owners (passive and active)?  All these issues came up when we were working with various companies in 1999-2000 on possible pipe/wire companies.

The Suggestion:

Create a short window during which utilities could divest their assets into a Transco without facing a tax penalty.  Under such a provision, current owners would be allowed to agree in advance to combine their assets to form a new company without taxes being levied on the spin off, as long as the new company was a transmission only company.  The shareholders of the contributing companies would received publicly traded shares in the new company, so there is no issue of the original company controlling the Transco.  The Federal Treasury is tax neutral, since without the provision the Transco doesn't form.  When the shareholders of Transco sell their shares, the are taxable, if the Transco becomes more valuable, then the benefit accrues to Treasury in taxes on the sale of the stock.  With a two year window, the companies would be faced with a one time opportunity to make the shift and avoid taxes.  This become a trigger for breaking up the vertical integration for which a business case can be made the shareholders of today's owners are better off.


	Thanks for listening (reading).

Steve

Let me make sure I understand this.  Prior to April 2002, the UDCs want their QF costs to be as low as possible, since this will cause the PX credit to be lower and thus the positive CTC higher.  However, beginning April 2002, they pray for just the opposite -- the greater their QF costs, the more they can collect from DA customers to help pay for the QFs.
 
I truly hope I have misunderstood you, else my brain may explode.

As Sue highlights below, when people talk about stranded costs ending no later than 3/31/02, they are only speaking about generation-related stranded costs.  Above market costs for QFs will be ""collected"" from DA customers for some time into the future.  Wanted to make sure that this was clear.

Subject:        RE: Summary or PX Credit Proposals 

An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9:  SCE said that it has TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesn't know what to charge for DWR. Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-related CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that will return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the ""market"".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE""s advice letter approaches, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some different PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they have a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (making it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollected while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surcharge.  The half cent addition is for 12 months.

Subject:        Summary or PX Credit Proposals 


I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything.  

Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues associated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve Swain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is to have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th.  

Current Issues: 
1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undetermined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)

2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not) 
3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised PX credits 

4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D 
5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charges), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions

6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE 


The four proposals are as follows: 

SCE Recommended Approach 
        This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 18, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the  gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed.   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no    generation/commodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent)  will be applicable to Direct Access customers.  

        Enron would request the following: 
        1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC 
        2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an ""allowable claim"" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possible.  

        3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument 
        4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent   level. 

        5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if/when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC 

        Other consideration: 
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


PG&E Recommended Approach 
        This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January 18, 2001 would include an ""avoided cost""  component.  This avoided cost  

        component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDWR purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchases.        This resulting ""avoided cost"" would be used in lieu of the PX clearing price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDWR purchase  costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embedded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation.  

        
        Enron would request the following: 
        Same as above 

        Other Consideration: 
        Enron  would continue to be exposed to ""price"" risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would hamper     Enron's ability         to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio. 

Hybrid Approach 
        This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from January 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is         applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal. 

        Enron would request the following: 
        Same as SCE and PG&E approach 

        Other considerations: 
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


Enron Model 
        This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 and SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.   

        Enron would request the following: 
        It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial is        the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   However, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the ""value""    Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and CPUC.

        Other considerations: 
        This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge ""price"" risk, but this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated with the     actual collection of the PX credit.


Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we concluded in Wednesday's meeting. 

Thanks, 
Wanda Curry

PG&E also mentioned it.  Here is the excerpt from its commnets on the Wood ACR filed 11/2/01.

1.	What effect, if any, should be given to renewals of contracts originally entered into prior to the effective date of the Commission's suspension of direct access?

An appropriate charge on direct access customers obviates the need to regulate renewals of direct access contracts entered into on or before September 20, 2001.  Absent the charge, the Commission would need to address what kind of renewals should be covered by any potential prohibition against renewals.  Prohibited renewals could include (1) renewal of contracts whose terms expire without any provisions for extension; and (2) renegotiation within the contract term of any material term or condition of the contract, including price.  The Commission would also need to consider whether an interim prohibition on renewals is needed to stop renegotiations or renewals that are very likely underway already, pending final Commission action.

Subject:	RE: CA Extenstions/Amendments

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA ""contract"".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

Subject:	Re: Stakeholder Committee Notes

To add to Charles memo..

1) The Trustees were all present to listen the debate at the stakeholders committee. That was very positive.

2) The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues. 

3) Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to make the required transition. If not alternatives would be pursued; example EISB

4) Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations should be taken as a package, as a necessary first step.  These include:

1. Committee Representation . The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees representation and voting to reflect the Task Force's attached ""Initial Sectors and Criteria Model."" This Model is based on the Task Force's preference for representation by ""sector,"" and incorporates the Task Force's general recognition that an RTO sector should be included. The Task Force recognizes that some work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and the criteria for belonging, but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately. Assuming that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Model, including the new weighted voting procedures, the Task Force recommends that two ISO/RTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existing standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role for ISOs/RTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemented.

2. Committee Participation and Voting . The Task Force recommends open participation in each sector, subject to certain criteria and qualifications. The Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedures used in several Regions (ERCOT and MAAC), and has incorporated features of those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures. Specifically, the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within each sector, similar to what is done in MAAC.

3. Due Process . The new Organization Standards Process, which will be presented to the Board in October, addresses most due process issues and concerns. The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately.

4. One-Stop Shop . The Task Force favors having a single organization for developing Reliability Standards, Market Interface Practices, and Commercial Practices. The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinvent itself to become this organization, and should take definitive steps in that direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings.

5. Funding . The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to decouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils. The Funding Task Group recommendations, adopted by the Board in February 2001, should be pursued.

6. MIC Role in Standards Approval . The Task Force recommends, as an immediate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Process, and to provide a ""bridge"" until the new Organization Standards process is implemented, requiring the MIC to vote on all new/proposed NERC Operating Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board, including consideration of any minority positions.

5) Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a possible alternative.

6) Silence on the issue of ""self regulating organization"" . No one advocating that position.

7) Good opportunity to speak with Trustees one-on-one at dinner.

Jose

Subject:	Stakeholder Committee Notes

Here are some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vancouver this Monday.

The customers met for almost 2 hours before the start of the SHC meeting.  Reps from Enron, Mirant, Dynegy, DENA, APPA and ELCON were present.

All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the customer side.  This may mean putting aside some internal positions.  Customers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting organization for both reliability and commercial issues. The Goulding Task Force recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action.

Agenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues
To ensure unity in appearance, customers agreed to maintain discussions in front of the Independents at a higher policy level.   Many details are needed to get individual entities ""on board"" however, such details should not impede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles, i.e.-one-stop-shop, balance of membership, etc.  Therefore, all agreed to keep details out of the discussion, i.e.-funding, seats, charter, etc.

The actual SHC discussion was constructive, and persons articulated the need for a package deal to the room. The debate brough the expected concerns of the transmission providers to the surface.  TVA (Terry Boston) was most vocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side.   Dominion Resources (Glenn Ross) supported the customers' position.  PJM (Phil Harris was also supportive).  

Agenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators
Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC does not have the authourity to require corporate independence. Suggestions made to perform better and more audits.  Dave Penn brought up the memo from Roy Thilly.  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolution.  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new competitive market structure.  FRCC (Wiley) made arguments that the NERC should not revamp policies to police the few bad apples.  Should deal directly and specifically with the problem. 

A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions:
1) NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it.
2) NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take specific actions to safeguard independent judgement (audits)

The vote was 21/24.  There were strong comments that this vote was not intended to be an industry representative vote, only to show how split the industry is over this issue.

The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting reconvened.
The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following:

?	Establish a goal/vision to become the one stop shop for development of wholesale electric industry standards.  
?	Add words that ""we need to go forward from where we are.
?	Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in new Board agenda item 22.
?	Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian and US government entities.
?	Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state and provincial regulators, and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, an on a course of action to institute such capabilities.
?	Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operation issues as they affect wholesale operations.

Agenda Item 9 -Transmission Expansion
Reference to ""incentive rates"", and ""accelerated amortization"", should be removed, not a reliability policy need. 
The reference to these expansion solutions are intended to be tutorial and does not assume NERC will begin to undertake rate issues.  APPA - public perception will be different.  Must remove this language.  Glen Ross will present this report to the Independents outlining the strong opinions on both sides.

Subject:	FERC exceeded jurisdiction w/RTO say consumer groups

FERC Exceeded Jurisdiction With RTO Order - Consumer Grps 

Aug. 14, 2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

(This article was originally published Monday) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- New England consumer advocates Monday said federal energy regulators overstepped their jurisdiction in ordering the consolidation of the wholesale electricity markets and transmission systems in the northeast U.S. 

The Federal Energy Commission in mid-July directed operators of the power grids in New York, New England and the Mid-Atlantic to merge, as part of a sweeping series of orders designed to put control of the country's transmission system in independent hands. 

Federal law allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require transmission systems to connect, but only at the request of a state regulators, according to a filing made by Maine law firm on behalf of consumer groups, nonprofit energy groups and the attorney general of Massachusetts. 

""The Commission makes no claim in the New England Order that it is acting at the behest of a state commission or public utility, and is, therefore, without authority to mandate the involuntary combination of the Northeastern RTOs,"" the groups said in their filing, which asked FERC to reconsider its consolidation decision. 

FERC should give the three Northeast grid operators a transition period to evolve into three regional transmission organization, or RTOs, with similar market designs, transmission tariffs and governance structures before requiring them to merge, the filing said. 

The commission directed the operators of the wholesale power grid in New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic to meet with utilities, generators, trade groups, state regulators and a FERC judge in Washington for 45 days beginning July 19 to outline plans for creating one transmission organization from Washington, D.C., to Maine. The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks. 

The commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid ""at breakneck speed"" without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging, the consumer groups said in their filing. 

Young has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations, but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details. Participants have said, for example, that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard, but haven't defined what that tariff and standard should be. 

""Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks,"" said Anthony Buxton, an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Monday's filing. 

All 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings, Young said. Next week, they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day, according to Young and market participants. 

The commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision, as evidenced by Chairman Curt Hebert's resignation last week, and should therefore reconsider its order, Buxton said. 

The consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast U.S. will run. Market participants, including consumers, will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and won't be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market, as they do now, Buxton said. 

This decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors. In that order, the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate 

The consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England, Buxton said. 

""Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what it's done,"" Buxton said.

Jim -- Is this what you want for your executive update?




CURRENT FERC INITIATIVES:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:   The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and Steve Walton from Enron will make a presentation on transmission planning and expansion.  Comments will be submitted to FERC in mid-November regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  In addition, the Commission stated that RTOs would not be required to begin on the Order No. 2000 start date of December 15, 2001; however, all public utilities are now required to commit by December 15, 2001 to join a FERC-approved RTO or lose their market based rate authority.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.  Comments are due late November.

ICAP Inquiry:  Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit expert testimony on this issue.  Comments are due October 17.
California Audit and West wide Price Cap Mitigation:  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.  
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required, including at least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and will require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information.  Enron filed comments on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact.  Hearing will be held in mid-December.
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  We expect a Commission order shortly.  
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocating, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings by the end of October.  
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission.  Enron filed comments advocating a NE RTO based on the PJM congestion management system with a proposed start date of December 15, 2002 (PJM has proposed an implementation date of November 2003).  Commission action is expected on or before October 31.  
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pending before the Commission (advocating an independent transco structure for the RTO and an LMP/financial transmission rights congestion model).  Enron filed comments in support (and advocating a December 2002 start date).  Commission action is expected on or before October 31.  
West -wide RTO Proceedings:  The Commission stated that it wants the proposed Desert Star RTO and RTO West to ""marry up"" into one RTO.  It appears that the Commission will treat California separately.  The Desert Star RTO has collapsed and the transmission owners are now proposing a ""transco"" structure.  Commission action is expected later this year.
Interconnection proceeding:     The Commission is expected to address interconnection issues (with standardized procedures and agreements likely) at its meeting on October 11.  Enron has strongly advocated standardized procedures and will participate in the proceeding.
Market Based Rate Authorization:  The Commission is expected to address procedures for qualifying to sell power at market based rates, which may include an assessment of localized generation in a particular region (""supply margin assessment"").   The Commission is also considering adding tariff language that could make market based rates subject to refund upon date of a complaint or finding by FERC of market abuse.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
      Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
           Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
           Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
           Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: November 12, 2001

RE: EPSA Draft Motion to Intervene and Protest in the
      WestConnect RTO filing
?			Filing due November 15th
?
Attached is EPSA's motion to intervene and protest in the WestConnect RTO filing (Docket Nos. EL02-9-000 and RT02-1-000).  The draft primarily focuses on independence and governance issues, however also highlights the WestConnect tariff, congestion management, market monitoring, pricing and interconnection aspects of the filing.  For example, the draft argues that the participating transmission owners retain too much authority over RTO operations, that FERC should require all RTO load to take service under the WestConnect tariff, and that WestConnect should adopt the GridFlorida market monitoring plan.

Interventions are due to FERC on Thursday, November 15th.  Please have any edits or comments to Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org by noon on Wednesday, November 14th.   We'll also discuss the draft on this week's Regulatory Affairs conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 3:30 P.M. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  If you have further questions or comments, please contact Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org or 202-628-8200.

Subject: Order 888 Argument


Please think about the following:
 
In a 20-minute Supreme Court argument [the limit will be strictly observed], one needs to be ready to answer questions of all sorts, but one cannot count on being able to make more than 2-3 points, and each of them needs to be clear from the first sentence; points that require development don't work.  In light of that:
 
1.    Should I plan to spend any minutes on the ""New York"" side of the case, i.e., arguing that *all transmissions over the grids are in interstate commerce and FERC has jurisdiction whether the ensuing sale is wholesale or retail*?  On the one hand, the ""NY issue"" is more important to Enron than the ""Enron issue""; on the other hand, my sense is that we are way ahead on the NY issue after the briefs, and the SG will likely do a good job on it in argument.  My sense is that I should be prepared, if necessary, to utter something like the starred portion of the first sentence of this paragraph, and to defend it against any questions, but should not otherwise plan to get into these issues. 
We should probably also have a canned sentence ready to address NY's wacky preemption argument, which the one that it relied on most heavily in its opening brief.
 
2.    I think my most important tasks are to make clear that (i) this case is about FERC's power to require nondiscriminatory access to the interstate grids (and not about rates or state regulation of retail sales) and (ii) it is important to the nation that FERC have such power.  I need to make these points quickly and vividly, in a way that the Justices will carry away.  That is going to be hard, because theoretical abstractions are not vivid, examples take too long to develop and provoke quarrels about details, and metaphors are generally too inexact.  Please consider whether I am right about the two points being most important, and think about how to make them.
 I think these points are the most important, along with making the Court comfortable with the idea that if they adopted our position they would not be turning upside down a federal/state regulatory division that's been in place for 60 years.  
 
3.    Although in a formal sense our case turns on the Chevron issue (plain language, no ambiguity, hence no room for discretion), my instinct (but I am not at all sure about this) is that I should not plan to devote time to these matters.  First, they are covered well in the briefs.  Second, whether one sees ""ambiguity"" does not really depend on staring at the language but on understanding what ""transmission in interstate commerce"" necessarily covers in the present age.  In other words, the way to win the Chevron point is to win the points in the previous paragraph.  Hence I ought to prepare to get the word ""unambiguous"" in there somewhere in the middle of a sentence, and defend it if necessary, but not do more.  Does this seem right? 
I think it's worth giving a little more attention since this is the key issue below and, ultimately, the issue on which the Court must rest its decision.  We don't want to lose the trees for the forest.  That said, since we've dealt with it at length in the briefs, I don't know that we need much more than a reminder of the issue and the arguments:  FERC asserts that section 201(b) does not unambiguously determine whether transmission bundled with retail sale is a transmission or a ""sale of electric energy at wholesale"".  It concluded that such transmission is a sale.  The D.C. Circuit erroneously held that FERC's interpretation was permissible.  But transmission doesn't stop being transmission merely because it is sold together with generation:  it is both transmission and a necessary component (query whether ""component"" is the best word to use) of a retail sale.  Therefore, under the clear language of section 201(b), jurisdiction over all transmissions, including transmissions bundled with retail sales, is vested in FERC.
 
On the related point of NY's position that the wholesale/retail bright line applies to transmission:  in particular light of NY's interpretive gymnastics in its reply (re: 201(a), at p.6), isn't a good one-liner simply that if Congress intended to limit FERC's transmission jurisdiction to transmissions for wholesale, then s. 201(b) would read ""The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to the sale of electric energy at wholesale and all associated transmissions"" (or something to that effect)?
 
Note:  this issue opens the door to discussion of, among other things, whether the exclusive purpose of section 201(b) was to fill the Attleboro gap; and questions about the structure of the FPA, e.g., the relationship between 201(b) and 211/212, 206(d), etc.
 
4.   What do I do in argument with LP&L?  I find the NGA parallel very compelling, and IF the Court decides to go with us it will have no problem citing and following that case.  On the other hand, the argument does not seem to have persuaded anybody but our team (not CADC for example).  On balance, I am inclined to say ""The Court has already decided this issue under the parallel provision of the NGA"" and use some time to press that point.  One reason for doing so is that in general it will be much EASIER for the Court just to affirm FERC and CADC than to push thru the complexities and agree with us, but LP&L gives them both a precedent for overruling FERC on its own jurisdiction and a comparatively easy way thru the case. 
Agreed.   
 
5.  I need to understand why FERC's powers and plans to create regional transmission organizations do not fully solve the problem.  I need to get a detailed understanding of the facts, and a one-sentence answer to why there is still a problem.     
The primary answer in our reply is that Order 2000 does not require RTOs, it only encourages their voluntarily formation; and that there's no indication that monopolists will give up their market power unless compelled.  (p. 19)
 
6.  Most important:  What other points (in addition to 2 and 4) does anyone think I need to be sure to make?  Even more important, what points made by NY, SG, EEI, California are most likely to trouble the Court and provoke questions?  Which of them should I plan to answer even if I get no question?
We might also need to address whether our position runs against 60 years of history:  Didn't the states regulate all aspects of bundled retail sales until Order 888?  Does our position mean that FERC historically abdicated its responsibility and the states were regulating without authority?  What is the effect of section 201(a) if not to allow states to continue to regulate the matters that they regulated in 1935?  This may be an issue to broach only if the Court indicates interest, though, since I think it's the toughest one for us to answer.
 
We might also reconsider our position that unbundling is merely an accounting issue.  It seems to me that reversing the position we took in our initial brief will basically hedge our bets:  it makes our affirmative argument a little harder (since we can't simply say that it's crazy to base FERC's jurisdiction on an accounting technique), but it also makes NY's argument harder, since they can't simply say that but for a change in the accounting for electric service the states would still be regulating interstate transmissions for retail sale.  This would also dovetail with some of the other briefs that made a strong argument that unbundling is a major change in electric service necessary to support competition among generators, and something over which the states have never exercised jurisdiction.
 
 Thanks to all for thinking about this.

A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? ""What we do in life echoes through eternity"".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to earn your trust and respect.  

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For those not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take some additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Subject:	Draft Answers to Questions

Here is my draft answer to the questions posed by one of the banks.  I am still chasing down some data, but wanted the group editing with me.  Would you please review ASAP so I can get up to Wes.  Keep in mind, these are the responses to Jeff M., not necessarily what they should or will share with the bank.  I think we should give them all the data points and let them judge what is disclosed.



1.  What effect of global slow down?  We believe that the current economic environment provides a good opportunity for RES given customers' desires to reduce/fix their exposure to commodity price volatility and meet budget and liquidity needs.

2.  How much of new business is tied to customer capital investment? To be sure we address the intent of this question we have three types of capital investment (i) Expenditures by customers - no new origination activity is contingent on customer capital expenditures (ii) RES internal capital expenditures - the only internal capital expenditures are approximately $10-15MM in Q4 2001 and $60MM in 2002 in IT capital expenditures (iii) We have, as part of our PRM Liability, forecasted expenditures for equipment at existing customer locations as part of our Demand Side Management (DSM) business.  For the next six months these expenditures total $______.   If not spent on schedule we would ""lose"" PRM asset value of approximately $____MM from loss of savings to be generated from these investments.

3.  What effect on business of CA decision to terminate retail access? Although unable to initiate new contracts within California, we believe that the renewal of existing contracts within Califonia will offset any losses experienced in that market and with the anticipated market openings across North America (especially Texas and Ontario in early 2002) there will be no negative impact to RES' growth.  Excluding California, approximately 26% of the retail electric market is open representing a total market size of approximately $56.1 billion.

4.  What is impact if order made retroactive? None, all contracts put in place have change of law provisions with liquidated damage language to protect RES' exposures.

5. What effect does slowing electric deregulation have? The pace of deregulation across the United States is uneven, however planned openings in 2001-2003 are adequate to meet RES near-term goals.  The California crises has increased customers' urgency in the marketplace and has reduced RES' customer acquisition costs.  Continued deregulation is important to our long-term strategy.  To counter the effect of the slowdown we have increased our product offering of Demand Side Management activities which bring value to RES and our customers in regulated environments.  

6.  What is credit exposure to utilities, PX, ISO - if still can't get numbers is exposure changing, what about Retail direct access credit receivables.  What of ENE's $580 in receivables is ""Allowable"" - how much is contested?  We currently have approximately $_____ MM in ""PX"" receivable from utilities ($____ MM from PG&E and $_____ MM from SCE).  EPMI has a $____MM receivable from the California ISO.  PG&E is contesting $_____MM of our recorded receivable and SCE is contesting $____MM.  We have a total reserve of $_____MM established for these items.

Attached is the most recent statement from the California Utilities that implements the DA Suspension (filed Friday). Comments are due Nov 28 (Wed) from parties.  

The Utilities continue push for a ""hard"" deadline of DA.  They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.  Of course, in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have DA service if the customer's name was not on our Oct 5 Customer List.

Jeff and I will be talking with Mike Smith (and anyone else who wants to participate) to work through our response to these comments.

Below are the flight reservations I am doing in advance for Christmas, to prevent last minute problems. I am arranging to flight coach. I think you would not mind my eventually exchanging 2 business tickets for 4 coach (as far as I know, the coach rate is less than half the business).
I would leave Houston Friday, Dec 21 at 7:02pm and return Thursday, Jan 03 at 8:44am

Subject:	Letter to PUC Regarding Texas Taxes on T&D Services

Jean/Jim:

Jeff Fischer and I in EES Tax have been working with Nancy Hetrick regarding the question of whether REPs will be responsible for administering Texas taxes on T&D services.

As you may have heard, at the request of a number of investor owned utilities, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts has initially ruled that REPs will be responsible for administering the taxes.  This conclusion was based upon the assumption that the REPs are purchasing the T&D Services from the TDU and then reselling the services to their customers.

After a number of REPs objected to that ruling, the Comptroller's office agreed to reconsider.  We believe the Comptroller is worried about doing something that will have a serious impact on deregulation in Texas, so she is passing the question off to the Texas PUC by requesting that the PUC determine whether REPs purchase and resell T&D Services.

The New Power Company raised this issue with the PUC recently and at last count TXU and Entergy had filed responses of their own.  A number of tax representatives from several REPs thought it might be good to show the PUC this is a significant issue for all independent REPs.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a proposed letter to the PUC regarding this matter.  Nancy suggested we send the letter to you for your comments and to get clearance for EESI to sign the letter.  Thank you for your assistance with this.

Ron

August 2, 2001

Dear Steve, Rick, and Jim:

I thank you for the opportunity to work with you and your staff over the
past six months. I truly expanded my understanding of the scope and
challenges of government affairs work since our initial meeting about a
year ago. In particular, I appreciate more the important internal role that
GA plays in supporting other units at Enron (the academics tend to focus
more on external actions in the public policy arena).

I hope that I was able to contribute to the projects that I was assigned.
The GA Assessment (more below) was particularly interesting, and clearly is
important for decision making about GA activities. I also enjoyed assisting
GA's work with EIM's steel traders.

Please give my thanks to your employees with whom I worked. My overall
assessment is that they work extremely hard and are dedicated to solving
Enron's GA-related problems. I thank Maureen and Ginger for taking care of
the logistical details and making me feel part of the GA team. I also thank
Gus, Earleen, and the other support staff. Finally, I want to recognize
Lisa Yoho: I really enjoyed working with her and feel she's an important
contributor to the GA team.

If you need anything from Rice, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I hope that we continue to keep in touch.



Cordially,



Doug Schuler

Re:     Government Affairs Assessment Process: A Brief Analysis
Date:   August 2, 2001


This brief analysis is based upon my assignment with Amr Ibrahim and
Elizabeth Linnell to review the ""Accomplishments for the Period November
2000 to April 2001"" reports filed by the GA professional staff. It is also
based upon some of the academic literature on ""valuation"" of business
activities where we are interested not only on the costs side (in a
traditional cost center approach) but also the benefits (moving towards a
profit center approach). The importance of considering benefits is that it
allows the senior GA managers to assign professional staff to areas
reflecting their highest benefit (considering the opportunity costs of that
assignment). Additionally, it should allow senior GA managers to articulate
more clearly GA needs (e.g., budget requests, personnel) to internal
constituents at Enron.

What I saw
Data were collected from about 60 GA professionals in the Accomplishment
Report for the period November 2001 to April 2001. Each individual was
asked to list his or her accomplishments, the unit it served, the area
(e.g., deal support, origination, etc.), its value, and the methodology used.

Regarding the accomplishments done during the period, about 25% involved
activities aimed at other Enron units, such as improving communications
between GA/PA and ENA and EES in the New York market, developing a GA
website with EBS, and working with EIM to design a risk management program
for a client. About 75% of activities were externally oriented (although in
support of internal Enron customers) primarily towards regulatory and
legislative bodies at various levels of government.

Very few individuals provided data for value and methodology. Probably less
than 20% of the activities were valued and the methods used varied widely.
For these relatively few entries, GA professionals claimed a contribution
of $6.43 billion, a figure that appears to be highly overstated.

My analysis would be despite the considerable efforts that went into
compiling and completing these reports, that senior GA management has not
gained significant insights as to the value of these activities or as to an
accurate methodology to calculate such values.


What is needed
If our goal is the identity and measurement of GA activities, it is crucial
that these be tied to the broad strategies of Enron. Otherwise, we run the
risk of creating a system that desires ""A"" but rewards ""B.""

Thus, the first step needs to be the identification of the most important
broad strategies of GA. The ""Government Affairs/PR Communications"" report
appears to be a first step: it identified such strategies as (1) business
unit support; (2) create open markets and other business opportunities; and
(3) regulatory and governmental risk identification and mitigation.

For each of these strategies, some primary objectives need to be
articulated. For example, for business unit support, some objectives might
be: (1) information provision: timeliness and accuracy; (2) transaction
support; (3) new market development; and (4) asset protection [note: these
are just my ""off the cuff"" objectives].

Then, we need to look a ways to assess the attainment of each of these
objectives. For example, with information provision, we might go to our
users in other units of Enron to see how they would rate (perhaps on a 1-5
scale) such things as timeliness, accuracy, criticality for their
transaction, etc. We might also count the number of projects, meetings,
memos, etc. that GA produced with information for other units. We would do
likewise for the other objectives.

Note that the ""Balanced Scorecard Approach"" (BSA) may be used to make such
linkages and measures. The BSA is a strategy implementation tool where
activities are measured and compared to the goals of the firm. BSA gives
guidelines on the types of measures that are appropriate: it considers such
things as leading and lagging indicators (training would be a leading
indicator as it occurs before the activity; profits on a trade would be a
lagging indicator as it is the result of various activities), and financial
and non-financial measures. The goallike oursis to try to take into account
enough measures of the activity to make a satisfactory judgment of its
merits. I believe if you could create such a system, you would have a much
better idea of how to deploy your employees across projects, how much to
charge other units for GA services, and when to outsource GA activities.

In order to do what I have suggested, I think that you will have to devote
more resources. One possibility is to assemble a small team with members
from GA and one or two operating units (e.g., a director from EES who has
some GA interaction) to create this systematic approach to GA evaluations.
You also might consider adding an outsider to this process.

Finally, I am amenable to discussing a role for me in the process. I plan
to continue to work on this valuation framework in an academic way (e.g.,
for scholarly journals) with Marc Epstein, one of my colleagues in
accounting, who has done much with the balanced scorecard approach. Once we
have developed a clearer framework, we would like to create a practitioner
version that might be useful for your GA analysis.

Ms. Elizabeth C. Linnell

Dear Elizabeth:

We are fast approaching our Fall Roundtables for members of the Retail
Energy Advisory Service.  These events are an important element of your
membership in the Retail Energy service and provide a terrific
opportunity to hear CERA's latest thinking on the current and future
state of Retail Energy markets.

We will be holding two Roundtables this Fall:

* San Francisco, CA, November 14, 12:00-4:30PM PST
* Houston, TX, November 16, 12:30-5:30PM CST

Each of these half-day events will feature presentations by CERA experts
on the current and future state of retail energy markets.  Among the
timely issues being addressed this Fall will be:

* The Retail Market Outlook
* The Wholesale Outlook and its Influence on Retail Markets
* Lessons from European Retail Gas & Power Markets
* Retail Billing: Regulatory Challenges, Technology Solutions

In addition to insightful presentations and discussions, these
Roundtables will also offer many opportunities for networking with CERA
staff, members of CERA's Retail Energy Advisory Service, and other
invited guests.

To review the most up-to-date program details, and for registration and
logistics information, please check back to the CERA website often at
http://www.cera.com/event.

I sincerely hope you will be able to join us, in either San Francisco on
November 14th or in Houston on November 16th. If you have any questions
or would like additional information, please contact me directly.  To
register, please complete the enrollment form on the CERA website, and

To get into this, go to MY COMPUTER, find the O Drive and then find the Public Affairs folder.  If you don't have access, please let me know.

Seems that, at a minimum, ARM should join, if it doesn't already plan to.  And we should also consider joining ourselves, since it is low cost to do so, and pretty cost issue for our book.  Thoughts?

ALJ Pulsifer  --  Pursuant to your instructions at today's PHC, this is to
inform you and the parties that CLECA will file a Motion to Strike portions
of the testimony of TURN witness Marcus and PG&E witness Kuga that address
the creation of specific fees or charges on direct access customers.  That
issue is specifically before Comm. Wood and ALJ Barnett in A.98-07-003 and
it is not appropriately part of the inter-utility allocation of DWR costs
that is the subject of this proceeding.  I believe that other customer
groups will join CLECA in that filing, which we plan to make on Tuesday when
the Commission opens for business.  William Booth

FYI - The report is attached.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 14, 2001



CAEM Study: Gas Dereg Has Saved Consumers $600B 


Nearly 20 years of competition in the natural gas market has reduced national energy costs by more than $600 billion, according to a new study issued Monday. 

This amounts to per-household savings of $5,938 as a result of gas deregulation, which began in the late 1970s with the phased removal of wellhead price ceilings, then graduated to lighter-handed regulation of interstate pipelines and now is focusing on opening up the distribution end, according to the study commissioned by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM), a non-profit think-tank in Washington, DC. 

""The nearly 20 years of competition we've experienced in the natural gas industry proves that the right conditions can foster lower costs for consumers and motivate the industry to make investments that benefit the environment, our economy and our national security,"" said CAEM CEO Ken Malloy. 

In addition to the cost savings to the public, the study credits deregulation for the rise in the number of gas suppliers at the wholesale and retail levels; a reduction in long-term price fluctuations, although it has triggered more short-term price volatility; greater focus on energy-efficient purchases by customers, making gas the fuel of choice for many; and industry improvements in how its buys, sells and trades gas supplies. In addition, it noted that light-handed regulation of gas pipelines has been a big factor in passing through lower commodity costs to consumers. 

In short, the study reveals that the gas deregulation skeptics of the 1970s and early 1980s ""were wrong by a long shot,"" according to CAEM. 

""What we also need to recognize is that we've witnessed a re-distribution of wealth from foreign oil producers to domestic natural gas producers, and that these lower prices have contributed measurably to a more stable inflation rate, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved our [national] security due to a reduced reliance on imported oil,"" said Malloy, who formerly was on the staff at FERC and the U.S. Energy Department. 

The study, entitled ""California Here We Come: The Lessons Learned from Natural Gas Deregulation,"" offers much guidance for the energy markets in the western state: 1) put the right regulatory framework in place, half measures are more dangerous than doing nothing; 2) don't expect results overnight, stay the course; 3) markets do work, and consumers and the environment will be winners under properly executed reform; 4) the costs of change are easier to calculate than the benefits; all the studies about gas deregulation underestimated the benefits; and 5) organized consumer advocates are often very wrong about the impact changes will have on consumers.

FirstEnergy has made a filing with regard to the shopping credit for next year.  In that filing they are claiming that they have reached 20% switching and therefore do not need to increase the percentage spread between the price we buy the MSG at and the shopping credit.  I have been working with Scott Reneicke and Nicole Schwartz and am planning to file an intervention on behalf of Enron and contest the calculation of the 20% (which includes affiliate transactions) and the argument to not increase the percentage spread and any other arguments Scott may identify. 

Given circumstances, I am assuming that since this is something I can handle, I should do so as opposed to involving outside counsel.

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed.

Leslie,

I have just completed reviewing the APS filing.  This paper explains much of the observed behavior of APS during the DSTAR (WestConnect) proceedings over the last several months.

The paper is so full of market ""scare"" tactics it seems appropriate to be reading it during the Halloween season.  The token effort of procuring 270MWs starting 2003 and ramping up to 1670 MWs in 2008 is ridiculous.  The statements that APS generation is somehow more secure and reliable than any generation not owned by APS, using the same grid, and that non-APS generators have little if any responsibility to the ""Full-Requirements"" customers are all beyond belief.  

The mis-characterization of the problems experienced in CA, OR and WA and the contemptuous citing of ""experts"" seems typical of the APS distain for deregulation.

The entire filing is more like a guaranteed plan to recover the ""Billion"" dollars invested by APS, with convenient adjustment clauses every three years.

As you noted earlier today, the Commissioner of the ACC may be more concerned over the APS stock price than truly encouraging open markets and retail access and what better why to help the stock price than to award APS a 14 year contract...look at what the Defense Department did for Lockheed!!!

I spoke with Chris Lackey who met earlier this month with Pinnacle West's (APS subsidiary) head of Trading who told him that PinWest is very conservative (as stated in the filing), their primary function is to support APS and they saw no real opportunities to conduct business with Enron.  However that could change if their petition is denied.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.  If this is approved by the ACC I assume it must then go to FERC, do we have an opportunity to intervene with the ACC and/or FERC in regards to this filing?  If we do, I'll be happy to help you with composition of the documents.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Jim, Jane Tholt is the primary contact for Leslie and me on this filing.  Although I wouldn't have any problem changing the order of the arguments, Jane is pushing the pooling issue very hard and she wants to see it up front.  She has actually tried to make even more arguments on pooling, but Leslie and I have so far convinced her that doing so would not be helpful.  We went over the draft with Barry, Janie and Stephanie last Thursday, and he did not raise any concerns with the order of the arguments.  Leslie -- could you work in an ""executive summary"" up front with bullet points?
 
Pooling is actually a very important issue for the day to day business on El Paso, and this is our only opportunity to make these arguments.  It's a major concern because increasing the number of pools was a key component of El Paso's proposal that is the basis for this proceeding, and we don't think FERC staff fully appreciates the consequences of increasing the number of pools.  In addition, a few of the shippers, including SoCal Gas, have indicated that they would like to have a system with receipt point rights all the way back to the wellheads, which the West Desk is totally opposed to, and unfortunately, FERC Staff data request questions seemed to indicate they might be seriously considering it as an option. 
 
Thanks for your input.  So far, I haven't had any comments from anyone else.

My only question is one of emphasis.  Are points 3&4 the key for Barry T.?  If so, should we move them up higher?  Also, why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points?  The length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate.  Maybe a list of bullet points up front?

The filing is ENA's comments on El Paso's proposal for receipt point allocation, focusing on discussions at the two technical conferences in the proceeding.  Also, it may be that, based on further discussion with certain other shippers, we will modify our statement in Item No. 1 to to support a different version of the method for allocating receipt point rights, but only if there is strong opposition to our method.  We don't want FERC to select the method that El Paso proposed originally.

Subject:	Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion, Nov. 20..... 

RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, 
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and 
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

DATE - TIME - LOCATION

Tuesday, November 20 
8:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
EB 8C1   

Video conference and teleconference capabilities are available.

"RE: Marketer/Enron response in SE RTO","Christi --

Fine work. Looks like we are moving forward in the SE.  

A couple of discussion points.    I am still not so much in love the LMP as this paper makes it seem you are (I don't believe there is a perfect solution).  Also, the document is not consistent relating to Control Area consolidation.  For instance, the issue around CA or RTO with tagging makes no sense if there is only one CA - the RTO.  This is important to highlight to the ALJ.  The easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world.  Also, I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA.  I personally despise the concept of a SAC - never has worked when times get tough.  Also, no real discussion (or maybe I missed) of timing to implement - next phase?

Anyway, great work in the mediation.  Keep pushing these guys from the South.  

Thanks,

Jim

It can sometimes be difficult to withdraw a filing, as the Commission actually has to approve the withdrawal. I have seen them refuse to do so, just to be ornery. The amendment may draw less attention, and there won't be anything that can be used as precedent, just something that someone may point to to embarass us, but which we can easily explain.  But in any event, by calling the staff first, I am hoping we get some feel as to how simply this can be done and maybe a withdrawal is in the realm of possibility.

Thanks.  The key, of course, is to create a filing that could not be used against us at FERC on these issues.  I guess that amending the filing is better than withdrawing the filing and re-submitting.  My only thought would be that by withdrawing, PGE provides no trail.

I spoke with Jay Dudley on Friday.  I suggested he contact the FERC staffer on the case to explain that they want to withdraw the request for the native load exemption and will simply have PGE execute a contract with the pipeline.  He will call his attorney at Skadden to find out who that staff person is and then they will amend the application accordingly.  I think it will be fine in the end.

Not sure how this got through the ""process"".  Please feel free to call on me if this isn't getting fixed right.  Also, should we just have PGE pull the application and re-file with different terms.

Also, Becky you should let Amr know and keep track - he can try and quantify.

Leslie - 

Can you coordinate with Jay Dudley at 503-464-8860 on how to change the filing (if at all) on PGE's pipeline issue?  PGE is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on Native Load.  They are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity (about 170,000 mmcf/d) rather than assume its right.

The goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next Friday, Aug 17. 

Please call me with any questions. 

Thanks,

Some additional issues we're hearing in the Northeast:
 
1.  Some people think the MM should be a separate entity -- a separate company/LLC/corp that monitors everyone, including the RTO.    We have not taken a position on this either way.  Others are pushing this a lot.
 
2.  Some people have advocated that the MM have section 205 rights.  We have opposed this.
 
3.  Christi, with regard to your example of the MM having ""penalty"" authority, I agree with your example but would be careful in regarding this type of MM authority has ""penalty"" authority.  I see this more as implementing a FERC order, and we don't want to go down the slippy slope of saying that some types of ""penalties"" may be appropriate.

Subject:        RTOs and Market Monitoring 




The structure of an independent market monitor is arising in the RTO proceedings.  These are some thoughts: 

Market monitor should have the ability to monitor the activities of the RTO and the markets.  For example, if the RTO is a transco, it is appropriate for the MM to review whether the RTO is doing something potentially problematic in planning, ATC calcs, etc. 
MM should only have the ability to recommend changes to market structure, possible penalties, etc.  MM should not have the ability to issue a penalty to any one without first going to FERC.  It is possible that the MM could ask for FERC pre-approval to issue ""penalties"" or remedies for certain conduct.  The example that comes to mind is the $1000 price cap in PJM.  It has been approved at FERC and if someone bids above it, the MM could reduce the bid to $1000 without going to FERC again. 
MM has no authority that FERC does not have.  (I have heard some (outside of Enron) people state that the MM should have authority to do things that FERC could not do.) 
Market participants should always retain their right to go to FERC before providing documents in response to an MM request and should retain right to go to FERC even if there is an arbitration clause (should not be required to agree to binding arbitration). 
Ultimately, FERC staff could provide the MM function. 


Let me know any comments ASAP please (since I have comments due on this Friday for the SE RTO).  Thanks.

Subject:	As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an ""Out Of Market"" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market (""OOM"") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and ""the Friday Burrito,"" an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

""There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, ""The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets.""

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the

collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have

those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Subject:	487 Revelation

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

Subject:	Latest Legislative Version of Direct Access --08.22.01

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly. 

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

Best,
Jeff

Why bring us if they had already made the decision?  Also, I don't know who is going to pay for more Market Readiness work in SPP unless AEP agrees to pay our costs.

Jean, Pat:

Jim would like us to discuss next steps. 

In particular what should we do regarding Comission decision to delay retail competition - docket 24468? 


As far as Docket 24469 is concerned (SERC-Texas), please confirm the following:

	*	Comission decision to delay competition applies only to 24468
	*	There is an ongoing hearing on 24469 
	*	Today is the deadline for parties to intervene.
	*	However, Enron is not a party in this hearing; nor we filed any motion to intervene
	*	Comission has not requested Enron a specific Request for Testimony
	*	Arguments for delaying competition in SERC are similar to the ones for SPP
	*	Therefore, Comission may decide to delay retail competition as well
	*	Is there anything we can do about it?

Any other ideas?

I made a quick call to Dynegy, WIliams and Reliant to see how they were approaching the meeting. 

Williams and Reliant seem to think this is a very positive step, and are bringing decisionmakers and no attorneys.  They each plan to have 2 - 3 people there.  They see this as an opportunity to have FERC staff ask the ISO some hard questions and demand some answers.

Dynegy is less optimistic.  It currently plans to bring Joel Newton out, its FERC attorney, but that decision is ""subject to change."" Dynegy agreed that the letter and approach were strange.

All three will have someone there who can make decisions and agree to protocols. We may want to do the same -- if we can get someone to come from the desk.

Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") are exposed to market, credit, operational and liquidity/funding risks in the normal course of its business activities.  The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the ""Policy"") on August 14, 2001.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluated, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transactions via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes, and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of various risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management framework.  

Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at <http://home.enron.com/resources>.  Following an initial transiton period, various individuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk management framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an example of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.

We are working very hard to have an operational and reliable EDI environment in New York. So far, we are covering the three main billing scenarios (UDC-bill ready, UDC-rate ready and ESCO-bill ready) that we may choose and switch as needed. EDI billing is not ready yet but we expect having it implemented (testing included) at the most by May 2002. I'll keep you posted on the latest developments. Let me know if you need any questions.

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

I was told Bradford would, ""release the $1 million tomorrow.""  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

Subject:	RE: Enron's Security Review

Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		1,395						1,395
Peak Month MWh	8,993						5,694
Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Looks very good.  We need to stress the points on what we need FERC to do -- fix their mistakes in the Rehearing.  One other point, maybe we should stress that FERC could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the Cal ISO is taking so long.  Also, don't be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the ""abuses"" of the Cal ISO and its lack of independence.

I'm looking for direction on who in the company this request should be sent to.  I typically would have forwarded to Jeff Keeler/Mary Shoen with a copy to Fred Mitro and Ben Jacoby.  Let me know if you have any other suggestions and I will forward this message on.

ps--I believe that the answer to the question is that we do not own any units, as we sold the Lincoln Center project last year, but I am not in the know enough about whatever else we might have an ownership interest in to make that determination.

Dear Ms. Landwehr:

According to Illinois EPA records, Enron Corp. owns or operates one or more emission units that are subject to the Pollution Control Board's regulations for the control of nitrogen oxides (NOx SIP rules) specifically, 35 Ill. Adm. Code Part 217, Subparts U and W.  As such, this letter is intended to remind Enron Corp. of its obligation to submit to the U.S. EPA Clean Markets Division a complete account certification of representation as required by the NOx SIP rules.  This certification must include information sufficient to establish an account representative for the source and an account for each unit at the source that is subject to the NOx SIP rules.

If Enron Corp. has not already done so, please forward the requisite certification to:

		NOx Budget Trading Program
		U.S. EPA Clean Air Markets Division
		Mail Code 6204N
		1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
		Washington, DC 20460

As required by the NOx SIP rules, please forward a copy of the certification to:

		Compliance and Enforcement Section, Bureau of Air
Illinois EPA
		Mail Code 40
		P.O. Box 19276
		Springfield, IL 62794-9276


Should you have questions regarding the certification please contact U.S. EPA's Clean Air Markets Division Hotline at 202/564-9620 or Scott Owens of my staff at the above-referenced telephone number.

Sincerely,




Julie K. Armitage, Acting Manager

"RE: Energy Infrastructure Security Legislation","John --

On this bill, I would think that as far as our competitive businesses go, we should work through EPSA.  Better to have the industry speaking with one voice.  To that end, do we know where EPSA is on this - Reliant and Mirant will have a much larger impact.  Finally, we probably will need this ability for our Control Area operators.

Subject:	Energy Infrastructure Security Legislation



Senator Schumer's office sent over a copy of the Chairman's Mark that will form the basis for a hearing tomorrow and a mark up Wednesday in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on energy infrastructure security legislation.  Pat is working with the pipeline group on how it affects them since it clearly applies to natural gas pipelines.

It would also clearly apply to PGE and to physical power plant assets we operate.  The main impact here would be in the area of criminal background checks, including fingerprinting, for employees in categories to be determined in DOE implementing regulations.  The background check data would be shared with law enforcement.  The legislative language says that the background check regulations will ""enable entities"" operating ""critical energy infrastructure facilities"" to have these background checks.  ""Enable"" is an odd choice of language because it could mean ""authorize"" only or it could mean ""require.""  We should assume that the background checks will be mandatory despite this odd language.

The definition of ""critical energy infrastructure facilities"" would NOT appear to pick up our trading and other energy services businesses beyond pipelines, power plants and PGE.  The definition is ""a facility for the generation or transmission of electrical energy, or the production, refining, transportation, or storage of petroleum, natural gas, or petroleum product, the incapacity or destruction of which would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States.""

If there is some reason why we would want other facilities included in the definition in order to obtain authorization for background checks, please let me know.  It should be pointed out that the current draft does not contain explicit legal immunity for employers who provide information about employees to authorities.

Subject:	disruptive technology, short and simple and confidential


We produce political/public affairs television programs which air in state capitols. Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio, expanding into NJ, Md and DE. The disruptive technology is this: the real target of the TV show is the guest, not the audience. Lobbyists have trouble scheduling time with politicians and regulators, and when they get on the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from government decision makers. We don't have trouble with either. Every politician and appointee wants to be on television, they always say yes. When they ask us what the topics will be, and we mention something like telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on television. In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them.
 
In short:
 
Step one: identify gov't decision makers that our sponsors want to influence
Step two: invite them on the program and, in doing so, develop rapport with their key staff members on the relevant issues
Step three: send briefing materials and/or give a briefing in person before the the taping
Step four: towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely been bragging about his/her policy agenda
Step five: steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics, framing the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to resist the conclusions suggested by the host.
Step six: take the statement of support for the position we favor e.g. tort reform, privatization, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. (which by the way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air) and in addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show, we digitize it and send it out to legislators, regulators and the proper beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker to back off later.
 
Current sponsors: Medical Society, Hospital Association, State System of Higher Education, Manufacturers Association, Cornell Corrections, AT&T.
Levels: 25K, 50K, 100K per year for Pa; 15k for Ohio (one level only).
 
This is an amazingly simple, elegant and direct way to influence policy makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energy-oriented firms in partnership with us. Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit.
 
I'll be in touch,
 
p.s. Sponsorship can be done in ways that are not visible if you prefer, via intermediaries, if you are publicity shy.

Identify who will prepare the affidavit and give testimony if needed

In trying to clear up some of our outstanding invoices, I contacted the
Enron Accounts Payable Department and they have no record of our May invoice
for $12,500.

They told me to go ahead and send a copy of the invoice directly to them,
but it will expedite things if I include on the invoice your Enron company
name and number and your external identification number. If you could reply
to this message with that info, I'd appreciate it.

If I can answer any questions regarding the invoice, or anything else for
that matter, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks.

Subject: CEC Siting Regulation: Staff Report and Business Mtg. Scheduled
for Sept 12


Recently, the CEC initiated a Rulemaking on siting.  The purpose is to
review and rewrite the Commisison's Rules related to siting of new
generation.  As the Siting Committee has failed to convince the full
Commission of how best to proceed, the Commission is scheduling a Business
Meeting on Sept . 12 to discuss this matter and, presumedly, provide the
Commission direction.

Attached is a staff report laying out the issues.

IEP is monitoring this matter through its Regulatory Committee.  Presently,
staff plans to attend the meeting.  Comments on the staff report prior to
the Business meeting on the 12th,  as well as comments on other matters
related to the Commission's Rules regarding siting, would be advantageous.

IEP is interested in hearing from company's willing to fund a stronger
intervention (i.e. the development of comments, etc.) than mere presence at
the Business meeting.  Please contact Steven Kelly ASAP if your company is
interested in IEP developing comments on this matter.

As some of you may be aware, Dick's consulting arrangement with Enron ends later this fall.  In an effort to make the transition as easy as possible, I would recommend that the following people work with Dick to transition on critical committees and tasks (nothing is hardwired, so if we need to change people, let me know).

Dick will attend the upcoming WSCC EPITF meeting (not sure of date, but think in the next two weeks).  My recommendation is that Steve Walton attend with Dick and become the lead.  We may not get a voting seat after Dick leaves, but we should try and cover.

Ray Alvarez should attend the WSCC Board Meeting on Aug 27 with Dick to pick up these responsibilities.

Charles Yeung should pick up coverage for the FlowBased discussions.  Dick will not attend the next meeting in Chicago that takes place on Aug 30.  

Andy Rodriguez should pick up the Security Coordinator Subcommitte discussions that take place Sept 25 - 27.  Dick will not attend.

I think that Charles, Ray, Dick and I should attend the NERC Stakeholders Mtg on Oct 15 - 16.

Finally, Dave Perrino should go with Dick to the next WSCC OCTPG meeting.

Let me know if this transition plan works.

Oscar -- At this point, FERC does not have jurisdiction over coops and munis (most public power entities are non-jurisdictional) and cannot ""force"" them to join RTOs.  TVA does not have to join an RTO either.  However, FERC does have some carrots and sticks that it can use, for example, a public that does not join an RTO could be precluded from using the jurisdictional (actually, the rest) of the transmission system.  Therefore, many will probably join just as they have currently filed ""reciprocity"" tariffs at FERC in order to have the advantages of using the system.  EK Coop currently has a reciprocity tariff on file with FERC, so would probably have to withdraw it at some point if it decides not to join an RTO.

Also, requirements to make publics join RTOs are in the current legislative proposals before Congress.  I am not sure that any will actually pass; however, Enron is working on this too.

Other questions are answered below.

Christi/Mike: 

In a meeting yesterday with East Kentucky Power Cooperative, they indicated that they will be joining a RTG to be headed by TVA which will essentially become and RTO for Public Power entities.  We have also heard indirectly, that EK will make some type of filing/release that they are non-jurisdictional and therefore not required to join any 

RTO. 

I would like your comments on whether FERC can force EK into the MISO or Alliance. 

EK has mostly 161 kv line with some 345kv and is right in the middle of the North to South transfer that takes place between the Midwest and TVA.

Key questions: 

1.  Can EK opt out of the process....even if they have a large transmission system 
[Nicolay, Christi L.]   Currently, yes, see above for sticks. 

2.  Will a RTG for public power be encouraged/discouraged.  If its discouraged by FERC, can FERC shut it down? 
[Nicolay, Christi L.]  FERC cannot actually tell publics that they cannot be an RTG; however, FERC has the same sticks.  If legislatively or otherwise (through DOE) TVA ends up joining an RTO, these others in the vicinity of TVA may well follow.

3.  Where in the process is the Public Power RTG? 
[Nicolay, Christi L.]  I am not familiar with this RTG (I don't think they have filed anything at FERC and they do not have to.)  JOE C.- have you heard anything?

any other comments would be helpful.

To All,

Below is the announcement of a Market Monitoring workshop to be held in San Francisco on November 16.  There is a fee to attend of $50.00.  The scope of the meeting is to discuss market monitoring in the west.  The workshop is hosted by the CAISO and co-sponsored by RTO West and WestConnect.  I am planning on attending and I'm guessing Alan and Sue will want to attend as well.  You'll see on the agenda, that the friend of the market - Anjali Sheffrin is on the first panel, so expect an action packed day!  And our own Vince Kaminsky is on panel 3 (Christi, do you know Vince and should we check with him on any positions we have?).

Kind Regards,

Dave

Subject:	TVA

Ben Jacoby told me that the state of Tenn. (through an Energy Policy Committee) has implemented a moratorium on the state reviewing air permits and siting on new IPPs.  Apparently TVA is exempt from the moratorium.  He heard that TVA has been telling the govenor's office that all the new IPPs coming on line in Tenn. are putting TVA's transmission resource at jeopardy.  If this is being said, it is incorrect because, per TVA's ""procedures"", TVA conducts an interconnection study before connection, so TVA actually approves the interconnection, plus TVA would not let the IPP purchase transmission (or would cut its transmission).

Enron's proposed plant in Tenn. already has the air permit, so Ben is not as concerned about Enron's plants.  However, this type of behavior could show that TVA may be simply keeping IPPs off its system (even though presumably they would pay it revenue -- same problems that we continue to have with VIUs).  Could this be helpful in messaging somehow to DOE, etc. that TVA should be in an RTO?

The spinmisters are already at work.  People at FERC thought we had bought into the ""new NERC"" Enron DOES NOT SUPPORT NERC in working through commercial issues.  We need to develop our opinions of where to go next, but right now you can respond to Dave Nevius that we still don't believe that NERC and its process/organziation is the right vehicle.  We are willing to find a way to do this, but we can't have the same SRO bullshit that they have been saying for 3 years.

We will discuss this on the 2:30 pm call Tues.

I think what NERC needs to know is that their job is not done. Big issues were tied into the Stakeholder's recommendation - changes in governance, voting, funding.  The idea of expanding NERC's role is not for the sole purpose of getting NERC to develop business practices - but rather get NERC to recognize the market and commercial needs in its reliability rules.  Presently, NERC focuses on reliability rules and considers commercial impacts as a secondary issue.  This is what the Stakeholders wish to change.  We must make sure that message is not misconstrued by spin-doctors.

To ensure, this, the charter of NERC would need to change and the idea of a Self-Regulated Organization should cease.

Subject: New Role for NERC


Jose and Charles
Given the actions taken by the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board
last week, we need to take steps to broaden stakeholder support and
endorsement of these recommendations, especially the one dealing with
NERC taking on an expanded role for the development of business practice
standards in addition to reliability standards.

At the FERC panel discussion last Thursday on standardizing business
practices, it was pretty clear that FERC is not going to make this call,
but rather leave it up to the industry to decide who assumes this
responsibility. In this regard, we would welcome the support of Enron
and EPSA.

Give me a call when you can so we can discuss where Enron is on this,
and how you might help gain EPSA's support.

Thanks.
dave

PS - I still remember that at the 1995 FERC Technical Conference on
OASIS it was Rick Shapiro who first spoke up in response to Betsy
Moler's question about who should take on the responsibility for
developing OASIS standards. Maybe Enron wants to be the first one to
publicly endorse the ""New NERC"" as the one-stop shop for wholesale
electric standards.

Subject:	Alliance Bridgeco acquisition of MAIN assets

Jim and Christi,

The attached document is a contract, approved by ARTO's members, covering the sale of MAIN's facilities and transfer of assets to ARTO.  The document raises the question of whether the Alliance is violating FERC's July 12 order by making ""business decisions"" that should be made by an independent board. You'll recall the language in the July 12 Order -- ""We further direct that from the date of this order an independent board be established to make all business decisions for the RTO.""  The footnote following that statement references the Grid Florida order, in which the Commission stated: Leasing office space, establishing employee benefit plans, putting accounting systems into place and other basic intrastructure tasks....clearly do not pose independence concerns.  Regarding the acquisition of transmission facilities...., any agreements for such acquisitions that are entered into before the independent Board is selected will be carefully scrutinized.""  Thereafter the Commission identified several ""more problematic' steps necessary for implementing market design, including the acquisition of software and other systems implementing market design as significant to the future operatioin of the RTO, and required that any acquisition of software or other systems implementing market design not be undertaken until the independent Board has been seated and given approval.

To the extent the facilities conveyed to ARTO via the Asset Purchase Agreement impact market design, the transaction is problematic.  The purchased assets include certain software licenses, but these may not be ""market design""-sensitive.

Please let me know if you want the Midwest team to pursue this issue.

Thanks for getting back to me.  I can make 7:30 AM next Thursday.  Are
you at a hotel in DC or surroundings?  It would probably make the most
sense for me to meet you there; we can talk over coffee, or else let me
know what would be convenient for the two of you.

If you are truly interested in this topic, and in any sort of hurry, we
can prepare a more detailed preliminary proposal in short order; but I
am guessing that you are not there yet, and we can just talk about it
next week.  There are a couple of different ways you could proceed; it
might even be interesting to combine forces with other market players
through EPSA.  So there's both the substance and the process to think
about.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the subject.

"Alliance - NG Next Steps","A couple of thoughts --

1.	NG is trying to schedule a meeting in Columbus either Dec 4 or Dec 5.

2.	I did speak with Ashley.  He indicated that NG has no specific inclination to avoid LMP in the real-time.  He did not, however, confirm that NG was indifferent.

3.	I am very concerned with the implication that Mike highlights in his point #1.  NG may simply have misstated its intentions.  But clearly this position makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I (they would be giving up too much).

4.	I agree that what NG is really saying is a for-profit RTO with ownership of some (but not necessarily all) transmission plant in its footprint.

5.	Let's try and coordinate our discussions with Paul Dawson in the London office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market.

Luiz -  Can you please develop some questions / talking points based on the attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meeting?

Subject:	RE: Alliance

Just been through the paper and have the following thoughts or concerns depending on your viewpoint:

1.  The model is inconsistent with the approach taken by FERC.  NG propose that every transco. sets its own rates, runs its own OASIS and manages congestion....how can this ensure 'seamless practices' within each RTO footprint?  I suggest the opposite will occur, that is balkanization.  For example, Transco's can join MISO under Appendix I, and a number are proposing to do so.  Based on NG's proposed split of functions each transco. could join MISO with its own tx rates, OASIS platform and congestion protocol regardless of whether they are consistent.  Under this scenario transmission rates and markets would remain balkanized and vary depending on transmission company geographic reach (similar to today).
2.  NG state that the benefit of a 'for profit' entity is that it can and will manage risk commercially, i agree!  However NG miss the point here....If an RTO/ISO is a non profit organisation, it will only provide services such as tariff admin., OASIS and congestion management (such an RTO will not own tx. assets...the tx. companies that it provides services on behalf of will continue to do so!).  In providing these services the RTO/ISO only manages risk associated with non provision of service, not the underlying transmission delivery risk.  The transmission companies, for whom the RTO provides services, will continue to be 'for profit entities' and will continue to manage risks commercially (RTO benefits result primarily from aggregation of services not from more appropriate commercial risk management...there is nothing to stop tx. owners from managing risk more effectively regardless of proposed RTO structure.  For example NG as a transco., Translink or Cinergy transmission could propose liquidated damage clauses for overselling firm transmission under the non profit RTO structure.  Likewise NG as transco and RTO could make the same proposal).  Commercial form is a second order issue!
3.  NG should have concentrated on supporting FERC policy (4 RTO's) rather than stating one parties view on separation of RTO functions between profit/non profit entities.  FERC policy suggests that the key structural issues are; increasing market size (4 regional markets) and third party access ('level playing field').  This was the basis for the CGM proposal that came out of the SE mediation.  Separating CM and OATT admin. from planning and security coord. improves third party access to real time information which in turn will facilitate market based investment decision making (being investment in transmission, generation or DSM).  Suggesting that transmission investment is necessary to resolve existing transmission constraints either shows ignorance or more likely the conflict that NG has...i suggest that investment in generation or DSM could resolve the problems just as adequately.
4.  The model seems to be based on the assumption that transmission charges will continue to be based on 'contract path' (congestion managed through redispatch).  I assume that NG, and other transmission companies, prefer this approach as it allows them to both maximise cash returns (above appropriate regulated rates) and control information that facilitates new investment (retain monopoly).  I agree with Jim that this suggests a physical approach to congestion management.  NG's concept that third parties can 'energy markets' is consistent with the ARTO approach (i.e. allowing an APX to provide day ahead market functions for example).  I would propose that a transco. should not care what tx. charging methodology was in place as long as it is perceived to be reasonable by customers and receives its aggregate regulated revenue requirement.  Thus CM and OATT administration are not core transco. functions at all...

In summary, I suggest that NG actually propose the paper to reflect a 'for profit' RTO but they do not state this anywhere (even if true, they do not state anywhere that a transco. should have consistent OATT and CM protocols if the assets they own are non contiguous or the transco. has a number of owners). I agree with Luiz that in this form it is a hard sell and does not resolve Enron's ongoing concerns...

regards
Mike

Jim

As per your request, I examined the attached doc (Response of National Grid US to Questions posed by the  Com << File: National Grid Transco White Paper.doc >> m ission)

My initial reaction is:

1) The simple answer to your question is: yes, I think the proposed governance and organization structure can live with an LMP model. I am not familiar with other MISO CM model, but at least in terms of LMP, my feeling is that those are not mutually exclusive. It may be worth asking Ashley Brown

2) National Grid and other proponents of For-Profit-Transcos may have other ideas on how to manage congestions (e.g. different reliability level products by customer segment). However, the attached paper makes no allusion to avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models. The paper does not imply a physical model either. Your feeling may be right, but it does not surface from the paper per se.

3) National Grid proposal is, in fact, an expanded version of the Southeast Model proposed at the Mediation. It reinforces the role of the Transco Company, preempting, to some extent, the role of the System Admininstrator. This was a very controversial topic in the mediation: the System Adminstrator was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias.  (particularly from transmission companies who are not willing/able to transfer their T assets)

4) National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea; Your concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are ""surfaced"" in the paper, by creating a concept of ""core vs. additional"" functions and a chinese wall, if necessary.  But the perception of potential bias does exist. National Grid will probably face a lot of difficulty in "" selling""  this idea. Particularly when we get to the details

FYI.  If we were to ask NG, could they live with the MISO CM/market model??

NG proposal for ""splitting"" work between Transco and other parties.  Don't think they do a great job of managing the key fears - (1) generation redispatch and (2) long-term transmission plant over generation investments.  

As I read this document, I get the strange feeling that NG is a physical-right player.  Meaning, NG needs to build a model based on physical flows so they can control (a) TTC/ATC and (b) use of non-firm transmission.  

While the NG letter states that the ""functions related to energy markets can be performed by a disinterested third-party"", NG specifically reserves as a Core Function the ""Ability to propose congestion pricing methodology"".  Sure APX could go in and operate the balancing and CM system, but NG has the right to design subject to FERC procedures.

Not sure what you guys think?  

I will probably get back to Ashley Brown later this week.

Joe / Thane

TXU was not able to send ERCOT the files as they had stated earlier this
week.  Here is the meter read information for 7 of the 11 meters.  The
other 4 will be read today.  The files (867_03) will be sent on Monday,
all still with a meter read date of 12/13/01.  This will update ERCOT's
system to show that Enron is no longer the REP of record for these 11
ESI IDs, once the files are processed.

Thane, please note, if I am correct, when initials are run for 12/14,
12/15 (as they are run 3 days later) the load may still show for Enron,
however on final statements, it will be fixed, as the meter data will
have been run through our system to update correctly.

Please call me if questions.

Thank you

I am working on the questions for Ashley Brown. I should have a draft tomorrow, to be checked by Paul.

In the meantime:

1) I am examining the currrent NGC system operator price control and incentive schemes under NETA. It is a radical change from the previous regulation. I would say it is a sophisticated piece of PBR. It includes penalties and incentives on internal and external costs (e.g. balancing) This document clearly states that the system would move away from central, merit order dispatch and would become much more self-dispatched. As a ramification, T rights would be defined on a pnysical basis. (far from our LMP, physical rights model). Your suspicion about NG proposal was right on targed

2) As part of the definition of Profit-RTO (which I think lends itself to multiple interpretations), I prepared this simple graph. In one of the questions we shoud ask Ashley where do they see themselves in the end-state. My feeling is that the Southeast Mediation Report advocated for stage II, NGC is stage III and the ""textbook"" RTO is stage IV.

"EPSA MBR Authority Leave Behind","Here are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper:

1.	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an ""out"" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.

2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says ""Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power"" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in ""real-time""?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?

3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a ""bias against new entry"" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  

4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.

5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market ""breaks"" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.

6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?

Jim --

I see in today's Energy Daily that the PA PUC person you mentioned when I was in Houston -- Kevin Cadden -- was officially named by Pat Wood as the director of external affairs at FERC.  You had suggested that once this happens, we should make contact with him.  Please advise if you wish to contact him first now that he is on board -- and make the introduction.  It would be good to get together with him now that the legislative side of things is heating up.  We can help them and vice versa.  Thanks.

I'm looking for direction on who in the company this request should be sent to.  I typically would have forwarded to Jeff Keeler/Mary Shoen with a copy to Fred Mitro and Ben Jacoby.  Let me know if you have any other suggestions and I will forward this message on.

ps--I believe that the answer to the question is that we do not own any units, as we sold the Lincoln Center project last year, but I am not in the know enough about whatever else we might have an ownership interest in to make that determination.

I have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that ""passes thru"" congestion.  There may be some billing and settlement issues given ERCOT's systems.  Basically, we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was.  I want to make sure that EES billing can determine how to charge this?

Hi Jim- 

A lot of visitors that Jennifer and I tour are not familiar with Enron and even less familiar with our history and what started the gas commodity industry.  Given your expertise 
and knowledge of natural gas, I was hoping you would be able to recommend article(s)/book(s) and/or spend about 20 minutes with Jennifer and I to help us better understand the history of the natural gas industry, what problems and inefficiencies exited to bring on deregulating the industry and how gas became a commodity.  

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Subject:	Invitation


I'm writing to invite you to a meeting on August 16 to discuss origination and trading opportunities in the renewable power sector. On April 1, we established the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading and West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply Enron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for green power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five year fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several million dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market nationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establishing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has garnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/demand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's skills in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the increasing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors, it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and market-maker in the renewable power sector.

I would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading and origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordinated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide basis.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a designate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agenda, and hope you will be able to attend.
 

Best wishes,

Subject:	Power Companies Unite to Lobby State

Power Companies Unite to Lobby State; They Want to Build Power Plants in Florida But Not Sell Directly to Consumers.

Sarasota Herald-Tribune ( November 01, 2001 )

To increase their lobbying clout, several of the nation's biggest independent power companies have formed a trade group focusing on Florida.

The group, Partnership for Affordable Competitive Energy, will try to
convince lawmakers to open Florida to companies like it that want to build
power plants but not sell the electricity directly to consumers.

Among the founding members are Calpine Corp., Competitive Power
Ventures, Constellation Power, Duke Energy North America, PG&E National Energy Group and Reliant Energy.

The announcement came a day before Gov. Jeb Bush's handpicked
research group, the Energy 2020 Study Commission, was set to discuss its findings with the Legislature and recommend opening the state to so-called merchant power plants.

Florida law prohibits companies from building power plants unless virtually
all of the electricity is for use in Florida.

Merchant power companies, however, make their money by selling power
on the wholesale market to other power suppliers.

Michael Green, Duke Energy vice president and PACE chairman, said a
deregulated Florida wholesale market will lead to lower costs for consumers and more dependable energy supplies.

Investor-owned utilities such as FPL Group and Florida Power Corp.
counter that they make plenty of energy, and prices are already among the nation's lowest.

Environmental groups worry that opening the nation to merchant plants
might set off a spree of plant-building that could damage the environment.
T
 he commission endorsed the idea of an open wholesale market last year,
but the idea buckled amid the California energy crisis and under pressure from lobbyists for FPL and Florida Power Corp.

Subject:	FERC Discussion on Standards of Conduct NOPR


My notes from the Standards of Conduct NOPR discussion:

Draft NOPR would:
adopt one set of standards to apply to gas and electric transmission owners;
broaden the definition to include all affiliates of transmission companies (including affiliates engaged in financial transactions)+
NOT apply to RTOs

The Commissioners were presented with 2 options:
Option A would maintain the status quo with respect to native load;
Option B would require separation of transmission function from bundled retail load.

It appears that there are 3 votes for Option B.   Breathitt was the hold out, expressing concern with respect to timing given that the FERC is trying to build a strong relationship with state commissions.    Pat said he was ""surprised"" to learn that bundled retail sales were excluded.  Massey sees this as an ""opportunity for discrimination to end.""   

NOTE:   Pat sent a message that, if he doesn't hear from ""people"" that this is the right way to go, he will back down.  He will be looking for factual evidence that on the costs and benefits associated with unbundling.   Massey asked staff if there are ""operational reasons why this change shouldn't be made.""  We may want to comment on this.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MEMORANDUM FOR HOUSTON

Update on Legislative Issues (September 1-15, 2001)

 ENERGY ISSUES

1.    Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman (D-NM) released his draft ""Chairman's Mark"" of electricity restructuring legislation.  The draft is positive for Enron on transmission issues (including access, jurisdiction and RTOs) and reliabiilty.  We have concerns about provisions on transparency, market-based rates and merger review.  We have said we are generally pleased, while we work to amend those provisions about which we have concerns.
 
2.    We drafted testimony for Jim Steffes to be the EPSA witness at a House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing on reliability, siting and transmission pricing issues (the hearing was cancelled due to the tragic events of September 11, 2001).
 

TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY
 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) said that he didn't expect the House to vote on Trade Promotion Authority until next month citing a need for House Republicans to ""get all our ducks in a row.""  Senate Finance Chairman Baucus (D-MT) has stated that he would wait until the House took action on TPA before he would introduce his measure.  With the House pushing the vote until October, it lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the likelihood that a bill will be done this year.
 
Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA), who is taking the lead for the House Republicans, has vowed to spend more time working with Democrats to craft a bipartisan product.  Ways and Means Ranking Member Carl Levin (D-MI) has not yet introduced his bill.  He is still meeting with Democrats and has stated that he wants to introduce the most ""balanced"" bill he can that will include labor and environmental provisions.  
 
The Administration continues to push hard for TPA.  They have made securing trade promotion authority their chief trade objective this year.  President Bush recently said that he wants TPA before the World Trade Organization ministerial in November.
 
BANKRUPTCY REFORM
 
House and Senate Conferees are hoping that conflicts between the House and Senate versions of the Bankruptcy Reform bill will be worked out expeditiously.  House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R-MI), who is chair of the Conference, has stated that the Conference will meet formally for the first time next week.
 
There are two sections of the Bankruptcy Reform bill that have significant importance to Enron: 1. financial contract netting provisions, which are included in both the House and Senate versions; and 2. a technical corrections amendment regarding production payments, which is currently included in the House version only.  
 
There are 32 members of the House and Senate who have been appointed to the Conference, which is unusually large.  The Conference has to deal with 38 amendments that the Senate made to the House bill (including the technical corrections amendment regarding production payments).  The Administration has some problems with the bill, none that pertain to our issues.  The progress is expected to be slow.
 
FY 2002 TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS - MEXICO TRUCKING BAN
 
Just prior to the adjournment for the August Recess, the Senate passed the FY 02 Transportation bill, which contained provisions that called for strict safety standards for Mexico trucks gaining unrestricted access to U.S. roads.  Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Senator John McCain (R-AZ) both vehemently oppose the restrictive language but in the end allowed a final vote on the appropriations measure.  They have vowed, however, to hold the bill up in the House-Senate Conference until the Mexico trucking language is resolved (note: the House prohibitive language is more restrictive, effectively prohibiting Mexico trucks from ever going beyond the current 20-mile radius they now have access to).  The White House has, on several occasions, reiterated their objection to any language in the bill that would halt or slow down NAFTA provisions allowing cross-border transit, which were to have been enacted January 1, 2001 - making the provision well-behind schedule already.
 
While the Mexico's Economic Minister has stated that he would not seek sanctions against the United States for violations of the NAFTA, Mexico President Vincente Fox has stated that he would consider limiting or even prohibiting U.S. trucks on Mexico's roads.  A recent study indicated that the U.S.'s failure to execute the cross-border transit provisions of NAFTA could cost Mexico's economy upwards of $100 billion per year.  
 
The Senate and House will now go to conference on the measure, and it's expected to be a contentious debate in Conference.  
 
MINIMUM WAGE HIKE
 
The House will likely act on a minimum wage measure following Senate action, which is expected this fall.  House Republican leaders are insisting, however, that any increase in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax breaks for small businesses.  Additionally, it is likely that the minimum wage bill will be a vehicle for other business tax credits and pro-business measures.  
 
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) said that the Democratic minimum wage bill will come to the floor in the fall.  It is expected, however, that Senate Republicans will attempt to add several tax cuts, which Democrats would oppose unless there are offsets (meaning, the tax measures would have to be paid for elsewhere in the budget).  
 
The White House has said it favors a minimum wage increase providing it contains flexibility provisions.  President Bush would be unlikely to veto a measure absent state flexibility provisions if it contained certain tax cut components.

Subject: Tariff changes effective October 22, 2001


The following notice was posted on the Nominations Electronic Bulletin
Board today:


On October 12, 2001 the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved
Columbia's tariff filing to become effective on October 22, 2001, subject
to an Administrative Law Judge Recommendation.  This tariff filing includes
several changes that may be important to suppliers, such as changes in
Columbia's banking and balancing service, introduction of a new Flow Order
Management Service, and a new Imbalance Trading Service.

The full text of Columbia's original tariff proposals, as filed with the PA
Public Utility Commission on August 22, 2001, can be accessed at the
following site:

                                     h
ttp://www.columbiagaspamd.com/products_services/tariff_revisions_effective_oct.htm

Shippers serving aggregation pools on the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania,
Inc. system should carefully review Columbia's new Elective Balancing
Service (proposed tariff pages 164 - 169) and choose one of the three
balancing service options for each aggregation pool.  Also, suppliers who
have been designated as an authorized agent for non-aggregated customers
may choose an elective balancing option on behalf of those customers.
Columbia's current estimated rate for Option 1, Full Balancing Service, is
as follows:

SGS, SDS Customers  $0.20/Mcf
LDS, MLS  Customers $0.10/Mcf

Please note that Columbia's interruptible banking and balancing service
will no longer be available.  The cost for the interruptible service
($0.1109/Mcf for SGS and SDS, and $0.0358 for LDS and MLS) will be removed
from customers' distribution rates when the new Elective Balancing Services
become effective.

Under the newly approved Elective Balancing Service (Rider EBS), customers
or their authorized agents are given 20 days in which to elect their
service option.  Customers or their authorized agents who do not elect one
of the three Elective Balancing Service options on or before November 12,
2001 will default to Option 1, Full Balancing Service.  Columbia will post
final rates for Rider EBS Option 1 by the close of business on November 15,
2001.  If the final rates exceed the above estimated rates by more than
20%, customers or their authorized agents who have elected Option 1 may
change their election by submitting a change to Columbia in writing  by the
close of business on November 20, 2001.  Columbia will begin providing
service under the elected option as of December 1, 2001.

A form for the election of Rider EBS options will be e-mailed to the
""notices"" contact person for each supplier that is active on the Columbia
Gas of Pennsylvania systemwhen it is available.

Please contact your Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. representative at
412-572-7117 with any questions relating to these new services.


Attached are the forms and a brief outline of the changes.

Rebecca/Nancy,

I did not file the Commission template as an attachment because I do not think that is necessary. Also, the filing outlining the customer classes and their meter classifications is not required by the Commission, and is competitive information. In the attached, I indicated the class of customer that we served during the pilot, and number of customers. That will suffice to meet our rule obligations. Please call with any questions.

Many thanks,

Subject:	RE: CA Extenstions/Amendments

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA ""contract"".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

Subject:	EPSA conference call re. Reporting Requirements NOPR

Today's EPSA conference call was well-attended and the participants seemed to agree that the status quo (i.e., making relatively limited paper filings of transactional information) is much preferable to the more extensive electronic posting that FERC is proposing.  Admittedly, though, some of what FERC is proposing seems to be justified -- for example, the FPA requires every public utility to show rates and charges in the form prescribed by the Commission, which gives the Commission a lot of latitude.  

The basic conclusion was that EPSA's filing should make the point that FERC should be able to find a way to meet its Section 205-c obligations in a way that is not potentially commercially damaging to market participants.  Also, FERC may be overreaching in requesting data that does not pertain to physical transactions.  Additionally, there was some discussion of requesting confidential treatment of the information to be posted.  EPSA will draft comments with the assistance of outside counsel, Dickstein Shapiro.  A draft will be circulated and if any of you are not on the EPSA distribution list I will make sure you get a copy.

Elizabeth and others, we have already discussed the importance of Enron weighing in separately in this proceeding.  Since comments are due October 5, I believe at this point it would be prudent to call our outside counsel so that we can begin the drafting process.

Subject:	RTO Week Comments

Comments on FERC's RTO Week are due on November 3 (Saturday) so we would like to submit comments by the end of this week.  Some of us have briefly discussed the types of comments we may want to submit on behalf of Enron, and the attached list of ""Talking Points"" are issues that Christi and I put together for Rick during his Washington meetings last week.  These talking points focus on issues that were raised during RTO Week by panelists that we may want to address -- either because the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  We will use the talking points as an outline on issues to raise in our comments.  

We also want to state up front in the comments that FERC is on the right track and that FERC has done a lot of analysis and studies to determine that ""right sized"" RTOs are in the public interest (this is in response to the negative comments made by the state commissioners that FERC is taking action that has not been proven to be beneficial to consumers).  We also want to make the point that RTO creation is not about retail access and does not impact whether or not a state offers retail choice.

Also attached is a link to FERC Staff's notes from RTO Week.  I have not reviewed these notes yet, but we may also want to respond to these notes in our comments using the same criteria as above; i.e., on areas where we feel that the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  

Please review the Talking Points paper and the Staff Notes, and let me know what you think about this strategy.  I am writing the comments and welcome all help and input.  

I hope to keep these comments limited (10 pages or so), so we need to stay focused -- raise the issue, make our point, and move on.  

Thanks Everyone

Sarah

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly

require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.

Subject:	Important Update on California Legislation--08.23.01


Received the following additional information late yesterday from Speaker Hertzberg's chief of staff regarding Direct Access in the legislation working its way through the Assembly.  He relayed the information during an informational hearing that an Assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in Sacramento.  See previous note attached below for more a detailed description of DA provisions in the bill:

A new print of the bill is likely to be issued today.
With respect to DA, the Governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of DA in the bill.
Assembly Ds and other market participants lobbied him hard, explaining that, since the bill covers all costs of bonds and DWR contracts through ""exit fees,"" there is no reason to suspend DA. 
The Governor is resisting hard, stating that ""he wants time for the market to stabilize.""
So it looks like the Governor's plan is to 1) have a bill that provides for Direct Access as of 1.1.03 and 2) have the PUC ""temporarily suspend"" DA from September 1 to 1.1.03.
We're continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate, or significantly shorten, the suspension.
The bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by August 23, 2001 (yesterday) will not be responsible for any DWR going forward contracts.  The customer will have to pay for any power consumed that DWR purchased on the IOUs' behalf between Jan 17 and the date of the switch.
The bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and Sept 1 be responsible for DWR going forward contracts (though details of how that would work were not clear).
The stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the August 23rd date is to prevent a ""rush"" to Direct Access between now and Sept 1.
There are currently NO efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to Sept 1.
Finally, the bill apparently will also give self-generation priority over Direct Access in each ""open season."" The bill would set aside 250 MW of the short position each year for customers to do self gen.  If the self gen is not subscribed, the MWs would go to DA.
The bill, including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues, is supposed to be released today.
The bill will be heard in the Assembly committee on Monday afternoon.
We continue to work with the business customers to improve the DA and self gen provisions.
It remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the Assembly.  
The politicians are very reluctant to pass any ""Edison bail out bill"" and the political pressure not to vote on any ""bailout"" is significant and growing.  But the Governor is working the bill very hard.
Mirant is actively working against the bill.  
Mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a ""bailout"" could lose re-election.  Mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take Edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes.
The bill also has to make it through the Senate.  Our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the Senate President, John Burton, who said flatly that ""he's not doing anything.""  But there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session, and the possibility of Burton doing a deal is 50-50.
With respect to the bill's provisions preventing Edison from paying wholesale providers with the ""dedicated rate component"" included,  Edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that Edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers.  Edison also said that, under the Assembly version of the bill, Edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds.

More info to follow as it becomes available.  If anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Latest Legislative Version of Direct Access --08.22.01

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly. 

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

Best,
Jeff

Can put some analysis into this market opportunity and relay the results to the Enron Direct team?  Current Shopping Credit versus 2002 Shopping Credit versus market.  

Maybe we should be highlighting the opportunity to pick up some quick market share where the saving opporunities are relatively large and have Enron Direct enter now to lock in the deals?

Pittsburgh 2002: A Golden Opportunity For Renewable Energy

The end of large stranded cost charges to consumers will usher in a golden opportunity next year for the Pittsburgh area to become the renewable energy capital of America. In the Duquesne Light Service Territory in 1996, rates for some customers approached 50 percent above the national average, with residential customers paying more than 12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Of this 12 cents plus total, about 8.5 cents was for just generation.

And what did consumers get for this premium 8.5 cents generation price, well above any price - including for today's 100 percent renewable energy products - seen in Pennsylvania's competitive retail market since 1997? Did they get clean and safe energy? Not unless you believe that coal and uranium are renewable resources.

In fact, the Pittsburgh area was powered by incredibly expensive nuclear plants that often were shut down more than they ran, as well as some of the highly polluting coal plants that kill 2,250 Pennsylvanians each year with microscopic dirt, cause acid rain, produce smog, and contribute to global warming. Both the pollution and the high costs were jammed down the throats of consumers by monopoly-friendly regulators.

Those who challenged the legacy of high rates and dirty power and asked the old Pennsylvania monopoly utilities about renewable energy were often lectured that renewable energy technology would cost more or was not practical. Today's competitive retail market shows how wrong those lectures were. Right now in Pittsburgh, four competitive suppliers (two are Green-e certified) are offering 100 percent renewable energy products for prices ranging from 6.5 cents to 7.5 cents per kWh. Those prices are less than the 8.5 cents Duquesne's customers paid for coal and nuke generation five years ago. In fact, they are more than a full cent less per kWh.

Since renewable energy products exist in the marketplace, are exponentially cleaner, and cost less than Duquesne's traditional power products, why have they so far not swept the marketplace?

Can You Say Stranded Costs or Competitive Transition Charges?
Customers who switch to renewable energy products pay not just the price of the product, but also a regulatory stranded cost charge of up to 3.39 cents per kWh. On a system average basis, the stranded cost charge is 18 percent of each customer's total electric bill and for residential customers it is a whopping 27 percent of the total electric bill. The stranded cost charge is paid even if you switch from Duquesne Light to another company, and allows Duquesne to recover uneconomic investments in nuclear power made when it was a regulated generation monopoly. Without the collection of stranded cost charges, Duquesne may have gone bankrupt.

Yet, adding the stranded cost charge to the otherwise less costly renewable energy products has the effect of increasing a customer's total bill when s/he bought renewable energy products. Thus stranded cost charges are a real barrier to renewable energy products and other competitive retail electric products.

But in 2002 in the Duquesne Light service territory, the regulatory ball and chain of stranded cost charges will be eliminated by giving a large total rate cut of probably 17 percent to all residential customers and by increasing the shopping credit from 4.89 cents to about 6.1 cents for residential customers. The removal of stranded cost charges means many Pittsburgh-area customers will soon be able to switch to renewable energy products and pay less or no more than what they were paying for electricity in 1996.

Yes, they could save even more by buying even lower cost dirty power products. But the coming opportunity to power Pittsburgh with renewable energy and pay less than 1996 bills is a once-in-a-century chance.

The Duquesne Transition
The reason why Duquesne will be the first Pennsylvania utility to eliminate stranded cost charges is its successful sale of its generation plant. Duquesne first swapped some generating assets with FirstEnergy and then sold all of its generating assets to Orion, while contracting with Orion to continue to provide default service to Duquesne's native load customers. Duquesne has provided distribution service and Orion has provided default generation service at capped rates without notable problems.

Without a former monopoly utility with a vested interest in keeping generation customers, a far greater portion of customers switched to a competitive supplier than anywhere else in the U.S. Competitive suppliers now serve about 30 percent of all Duquesne customers. The number of Duquesne customers served by competitive suppliers rose steadily until peaking in late 2000 at about 185,000, held steady through spring 2001, and then declined to about 171,230 as of July 2001. The recent decline occurred when retail offers exceeded the system's shopping credit but remained well below Duquesne's 1996 generation rate of 8.5 cents.

Today, there are four competitive suppliers offering six different products to residential customers in the Duquesne territory, one of which is priced below the shopping credit and enables customers to switch and save, and four of which are renewable energy products. Recent sharp declines of more than 50 percent in forward electric markets make it likely that more products will soon be able to beat the current Duquesne shopping credit of 4.89 cents and of course the 8.5-cent 1996 monopoly rate.

After 2002, the two remaining principal impediments of completing a successful transition to competition in the Duquesne Light service territory will be the full integration of its control area and wholesale market into PJM and wide deployment of demand-response technologies. Time-of-use meters and appliance-control devices allow customers to profit from reducing usage in summer peak hours, protect reliability, reduce market power, and can lessen pollution. The failure to achieve PJM integration and demand response could derail the benefits of stranded cost elimination and what has been so far a successful transition for the Duquesne Service territory.

No More Stranded Costs!
Stranded cost charges will likely be first removed for residential customers starting in March 2002. Up until now, average system customers have had to pay 18 cents on every dollar paid for total electric service so that Duquesne could recover its stranded costs. With the end of stranded cost charges, different classes of customers (and different individual customers, depending on their usage) will receive a substantial rate cut.

Current Prices for Electric Service from Duquesne Light
(Rates in cents/kWh)
                         RS Rate         GS         GL
Distribution     4.263             2.453        0.475
Transmission 0.250             0.257         0.119
Generation     8.50                 6.451        3.172
CTC portion
of Gen.             3.390             2.205         0.926
Shopping
Credit             4.880                 4.246         2.246
Total             12.533                 8.085         3.646

The portion of the bill that is the ""Competitive Transition Charge"" represents the basic rate reduction that each class will enjoy when the charges are terminated. The charges are scheduled to end in March for general residential customers (RS), April for smaller commercial customers (GS), and September for larger commercial customers (GL). The charges end for other customer classes as late as April, 2004. Residential customers using 600 kWh/month, for example, will stop paying 3.39 cents/kWh for stranded costs, reducing their total electric bill by 27 percent.

Real Market Prices
Generation rates will still be regulated for customers receiving default generation service under Duquesne's contract with Orion. However, the rates will no longer reflect the remnants of pre-restructuring cost-of-service rates. Instead, they will be based (imprecisely) on ""market rates."" When the PUC approved the sale of Duquesne's generating plants and the transfer of the default service to Orion, it approved tentative default rates at ""market prices"" as determined by the Duquesne contract with Orion.

The precise level of default rates remains unknown, however. Consumers would see total rate reductions of about 21 percent if the default rate is set at 5.5 cents/kWh, and a total rate cut of 17 percent if it is pegged at 5.9 cents. Again, these default rates are well below the 8.5-cent 1996 monopoly rate.

Although the Duquesne/Orion contract set and the PUC approved the default rates, the rates did not assume that Duquesne would be joining PJM West. There have been some non-public discussions taking place between the PUC, Orion, and Duquesne as well as some public discussions, but at this point it is unclear whether the existing rates should or will be adjusted. Whatever the precise answer, the PUC needs to move these proceedings to the public domain and resolve the issues expeditiously, so that customers and suppliers may plan to take advantage of the new market opportunities.

Competitive Market Opportunities
In 2002, the shopping credit will increase for customers who choose to buy generation from a competitive supplier instead of Orion's default service. Given reasonable assumptions about market prices and what the shopping credit may be, it appears that competitive suppliers will have substantial opportunities to provide competitive service at prices below the shopping credit. For example, if the present residential shopping credit of 4.88 cents/kWh is raised to 5.75 cents/kWh, as presently scheduled, consumers would have a modest opportunity to save by shopping in addition to the savings that all customers - including those remaining on default generation service - will experience from the end of stranded cost charges. If the residential shopping credit is increased to about 6.15 cents/kWh, suppliers competing on price would have a substantial opportunity to offer consumers meaningful savings by shopping.

One might presume that the 30 percent of all customers already shopping in the Duquesne service territory include many of those most interested in shopping. Will the opportunity to save a bit more after receiving a 17 percent rate decrease without shopping be sufficient to entice many of the remaining customers to shop? Setting the rate too low will provide a disincentive to shop by delivering even more savings to non-shopping customers who already will be getting a huge rate cut because of the end of the stranded cost charges. Given that ""market rates"" are a prediction that no one has been making accurately, perhaps the PUC should err on the high side to increase competitive market opportunities. There is no better time for doing so than when all customers are about to receive a huge rate cut from the elimination of stranded cost charges.

Renewable Energy's Time is Now
Even moderate additional shopping based on price does not mean a non-competitive market, however. Perhaps the most successful competitive suppliers will be those that offer products or services that encourage customers to switch for reasons other than price. Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and demand-side response products may well provide suppliers with the competitive edge.

The opportunity for renewable energy market penetration is, in fact, unprecedented. Two new wind farms are under construction at this time in Somerset and Fayette counties, bringing the total installed wind capacity in the region to about 34.4 megawatts (MW). Two additional wind farms are under development in the same area and another is under development about 30 miles across the state line in West Virginia, potentially bringing an additional 127-145 MW of wind power to serve the Pittsburgh market. Depending on the precise shopping credit, it is likely that wind electricity from these developments could be sold to retail customers at prices close to or not too far above the shopping credit.

Even if buying renewable energy is not the lowest cost option, consumers would still be investing a portion of their 17 percent rate cut in renewable generation and still receive a reduction in their electric bill from what is now paid. For example, a residential customer could buy one of the five renewable products presently available to consumers in the Duquesne territory and still save from 1 cent to 2 cents per kWh. Alternatively, consumers probably will be able to buy 50 percent wind energy and still receive a total electric bill more than 5 percent less than it is today and was in 1996.

Large institutions, government agencies, businesses, and families can, without increasing their current electricity bills, become renewable energy consumers. With their choices, they can make Pittsburgh known far and wide as the first green-powered city.

Subject: Meeting with Dan Larcamp/ Marketing Affiliate Rulemaking




Leslie Lawner, Becky Cantrell and I met with Dan Larcamp at FERC yesterday to discuss the marketing affiliate issue.  He agreed with the latest press reports that the upcoming rulemaking NOPR, expected to be voted out in September, would not make major structural changes to the industry.  The current document is up to the Commission level and the Commissioners are clearly considering the alternatives now.  Larcamp said he expected a broadening of the current market affiliate rules structure to include all corporate entities.  He did specifically mention that the Commission is not comfortable with the link between financial and physical transactions and the possibility for manipulation of market prices in one market (financial) to affect prices in the other market (physical).  He also expects the Commission to blend the gas and power rules, using the best practices of each.  Any NOPR that is issued will of course have comment dates to allow Enron and all industry participants to comment on any proposed rule changes.

Larcamp indicated that he did not think there were pervasive afilliate discrimination issues in the industry, but said that the Commission needed to act due to the political pressures they got from the Hill, etc.  The El Paso case is top on everyone's mind and is of special concern because it affects the California market, both gas and power. 

Larcamp indicated that he is just now learning what a ""Pat Wood"" Commission is going to want.  He indicated that Wood has closer ties to the producer community than either of the two former Chairmen.  He therefore expects  that the Commission will be responsive to that sector in taking a relook at the affiliate rules.  However, Larcamp did mention that the only meeting that he had previously had on the affiliate issue was with the INGAA group (Joe Hartsoe went with them).  It is not clear whether the producer community has lobbied this issue at the Commissioner level.

We discussed strategy with Dan, how to let the Commission feel more comfortable with the marketing affiliate issue.  He suggested that he had gained a lot by visiting the trading floors (including Enron's).  He thought the Commissioners and their immediate staffs would benefit from similar visits.  

We specifically raised the issue of market prices, and talked about tranportation costs not equalling basis differentials.  We stated that our marketers believed that the prices in the market were determined by market factors in the specific areas of delivery rather than basin costs plus transport costs.  Dan did indicate some agreement with this concept and thought that more education at the Commissioner level would be very worthwhile.

If you have any questions, call Leslie, Becky or me.

Subject:	RE: Texas Comission supports prompt implementation of SPP

SPP is joining MISO and today MISO said that the merger should be filed at FERC 1Q02.  MISO also told FERC that the same congestion management systems would be used in SPP/MISO, so no seams.  Since MISO is moving toward the market design we want, then really it seems that SPP should be implementing the MISO system for Day1 (which may well be up 12/15/01) and should be right in line with MISO on Day 2 issues (that we like).

However, FERC should not approve SPP as an RTO until it is in with MISO.  I don't see that FERC needs to approve SPP as an RTO in order to allow SPP to finish work on a wholesale energy system because presumably SPP will be using MISO's system.  This summer FERC told SPP to not spend more $ since it was not an RTO yet and it was going off on its own merry way.  Therefore, FERC could say ""use MISO's system and specify exactly the minimum that needs to be done on systems in order to have the TX retail settlements done.  This should be done consistent with the no seams, as represented by MISO.""  That should satisfy Texas PUC concerns.

My feeling is that FERC is not going to change its RTO plans because of this possible interference from the Texas PUC

A possible scenario is SPP to ask permission to continue the implemantation of a new settlement and congestion management system. A good point for internal discussion is: To what extent  we want to oppose to those changes ? (which seem to be aligned to our recommendations, but those may imply additional SPP resources)

You were right. SPP is going to use this episode as a lever to be ""promoted"" to an RTO. 

Texas is recommending three steps to introduce competition at Texas-SPP. One is described as follows:


*	Support the SPP's efforts to begin wholesale market operations: Mr. Brown, Vice President of SPP, testified that SPP can begin wholesale market operations and complete systems testing by April 1, 2002. He has requested that the SPP Board approve his recommendation to start to wholesale market operations. This Commission should support that process by:

-	Requesting in writing that the SPP Board begin wholesale operations as soon as possible with a target date of completing systems testing by April 1, 2002.
-	Advising FERC of the need to support SPP wholesale market operations. While Mr. Brown testified that the recent July and September Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) orders regarding SPP's start up expenditures will not impede SPP from implementing wholesale market operations, this Commission should advise FERC that the findings from our hearing show the need for FERC to fully support SPP wholesale operations startup.

It appears that the calculation and collateral call is pretty accurate.  Basically, EPMI had made significant purchases from the New England pool to fill the UI, NSTAR and CMP load (approx 1,000 mw/h).  Based on a 42 hour post petition calculation, ISO projects 30 day exposure at $39MM.  Since collateral is calculated at 3.5x, we would owe $137MM in collateral.  Unless we feel that our load/supply shape will change, as per the letter, we can request the ISO to reconsider the collateral amount.  Let me know your thoughts.

I am concerned with the credit worthiness issues with the various ISOs, and I am seeking your comments/advice on the appropriate action items that GA should take to assist the various sections in Enron to comply with the requirements in an expedient, proactive,  and cost-effective manner.    
1.	Perhaps I should start by mentioning that in NYISO, and PJM (and I assume the same for the rest), there is an obligation on the market participants for informing the ISO (some in writing, within 5 business days as the case in PJM) of any Material change in its financial condition.  The issue here should GA assist in communicating this change.   
2.	Does the Team agree that there is a need to determine exactly what are the conditions for posting a financial instrument.  How the instrument size is calculated (hence the total additional obligation)? how does it change with the change in our business volumes, or credit rating? are the terms for the financial instruments applied consistently to all market agents or just on Enron?
3.	What is the best approach to assist RAC in prioritizing which financial instrument should be dealt with first, if there is a prioritization process.  

I do have language for PJM, and NYISO if you would like to have access to them.  

I look forward for your comments and suggestions

Many thanks and Brgrds

PS:  Material change is a defined term in PJM, and includes a downgrade of a long or short term debt rating by a major rating agency; being placed on a credit watch with negative implications by a major rating agency.

Subject:        Senate Hearings 

The Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee will take up the 
folling items next week pending approval of the Rules Committee: 

Tuesday, August 21 - 1:30 p.m. 

Informational Hearing: ""A Review of DWR's Electricity Rate Agreement"" 

Wednesday, August 22 - 1:30 p.m. 

AB 1233 (Pescetti) This bill would prohibit assessment of local transmission 
rates on natural gas if (a) it is delivered to an end-use customer, (b) it 
is delivered through a transmission system owned by another entity  that is 
not interconnected with a local utility transmission system, and (c) it is 
blended with gas supplies produced from an in-state source for the purposes 
of achieving a usable thermal rate.  The bill would require the commission 
to administer this provision in a manner that prohibits any cost shift to 
core customers resulting from the rate exemption required under the bill. 

ABX2 14 (Canciamilla) This bill exempts certain natural gas producers, 
suppliers and transporters from the definition of a public utility as 
described in Public Utilities Code Sections 216, 222 and 228.  Specifically, 
this bill; (1) provides that a public utility does not include a gas 
producer, supplier or transporter if the gas produced is of insufficient 
quality or heating value to make it acceptable for introduction into the gas 
line, plant or system of a gas corporation and if the natural gas is not 
provided for sale to more than five end users, 2)provides that a ""gas 
corporation"" does not include a producer, supplier or transporter as defined 
in item #1 above, 3)provides that a ""pipeline corporation"" does not include 
a producer, supplier or transporter as defined in item #1 above (4) 
establishes that entities covered by the exemption from public utility 
status as gas suppliers, producers or transporters are subject to 
jurisdiction of the CPUC with regard to safety, service quality, and 
consumer protection, and 
5)requires these exempt entities to apply the public goods charge to end use 
customers, as applicable. 

ABX2 30 (Dutra) This bill would amend CPUC act to authorize a public entity 
to assume from a public utility the work of relocating utilities that 
relates to a project of the public entity if the public utility defaults on 
executing utility relocation work under a relocation agreement with the 
public entity in connection with a transit or transportation capital 
improvement project, and would authorize the public entity to issue 
contracts with another qualified entity to conduct the utility relocation 
work. The bill would require a public utility to reimburse the public entity 
for the utility's share of the costs of the relocation work in accordance 
with the relocation agreement with the public entity.

Subject:	FERC rehearing of the California monthly gas sales reporting requirement, RM01-9

This is not intended to be summary of the FERC rehearing just issued on the Monthly Marketers' Report of Gas Sales to California, but just a heads-up on one issue.  We argued that since we manage our business on an aggregated basis, we cannot report the sales, purchases and transportation on the back-to-back basis contemplated in the rule.  FERC's response was that did not relieve us of the need to report and that since everything is aggregated, then all purchases and transportation should be allocated pro rate to the sales made into CA.  This interpretation is as arbitrary and meaningless as the after-the-fact allocations of supply and transport to specific sales woud have been, that we argued against.  And it is probably just as labor intensive.  When Becky gets back we will look into the burden of compliance, but we have the option to seek further rehearing on this issue.

Subject:	Re: California - Credit Worthiness requirements

Amr,
The situation with the California ISO is complicated by the fact that they recently had to face a loss of creditworthiness from PG&E and Southern California Edison. In an ammendment to the the ISO Tariff, the ISO proposed revisions to the tariff that would in effect waive the sanctions ot the ISO Tariff's creditworhiness requeriments for certain entities that were creditworthy as of January 3, 2001 but were about to lose the Approved Credit Rating that established their creditworthiness. This only applies to purchases using their own generation and transmission, but opened a pandora box in the evaluation of creditworthiness for market participants in California. In addition, the ISO Tariff did not have procedures in place to admit guarantees from third parties to back energy, ancillary services and grid management charges. A process was incorporated to this effect recently to allow SCE and PG&E buy power backed by California Department of Water Resources.
In any event, each Scheduling Coordinator (SC), Utility Distribution Company (UDC) or Metered Subsystem (MSS) must maintain an approved Credit Rating or provide in favor of the ISO one fo the following forms of security for an amount to be determined by the SC, UDC or MSS in the form stated in the Tariff:
An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit confirmed by a bank or financial institution reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional surety bond posted by an insurance company reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional guarantee which has and maintains an Approved Credit Rating;
A cash deposit standing to the credit fo an interested bearing escrow accoint maintained at a bank or financial institution designated by the ISO;
A certificate of deposit in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO; or
A payment bond certificate in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO;
Letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, payment bond certificates, escrow agreements and certificates of deposit shall be in such form as the ISO may reasonably require from time to time by notice to SC, UDCs or MSSs. SCs, UDCs or MSSs that do not maintain an approved credit rating will not be allowed to submit a schedule to the ISO, and the ISO will reject any schedule submitted if the security amount is not deposited. If an outstanding liability exceeds 90% of the required security amount, a notification by the ISO will be issued to cover the security within 15 days.
As of March 13, 2000, an approved credit rating with respect to market obligations, is defined as an entity maintaining at lest an A2/P2 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating or a A3/A- (or equivalent) long-term credit rating from a national credit rating agency. Market obligations are Imbalance energy, Ancillary Services, Grid Operations Charge, Wheeling Access Charge, High Voltage Access Charge, Transition Charge, Usage Charges and FERC Annual Charges. I suppose day-ahead energy charges are also included since the dissolution of the PX, although I could not find an explicit reference to this issue in the regulations.
SCs, UDCs or MSSs  must maintain A1/P1 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating for the Grid Management charges, or the charges the ISO makes to fund its operations.
If you have any questions, please let me know. Regards,
ALF

RE: Industry Meeting Regarding the Wholesale Electricity
      Standard Organization

The Department of Energy (DOE) is sponsoring an industry wide meeting facilitated by EPSA, ELCON and the National Energy Marketers Association.  This forum will be held on December 7th, and is designed to provide an opportunity for open discussion on the organizational structure needed to represent the wholesale electric interests in the development of market-based standards and types of standards that should be addressed.  As with the previous industry-wide meetings held on standards development activities for the wholesale and retail natural gas and electric topics, the DOE has graciously offered its facilities for the meeting site.  The meeting specifics are below and a draft agenda is attached.

WHERE:	Department of Energy
	Forrestal Building
                1000 Independence Avenue, S.W.
	Washington, D.C. 20585

ROOM:	Large Auditorium, Room GE-086

WHEN:	Friday, December 7th
 	10:00 a.m.  to  5:00 p.m.

The nature of the debate should address the framework for an organization whose role would be to develop wholesale electric standards, including scope of activity, segments for each of the industry quadrants, and any additional key principles that are necessary.  As supporting information for the meeting is prepared, which would include a more detailed agenda, it will be posted on the GISB web site, (www.gisb.org) and sent out to both the Regulatory Affairs Committee and the NERC Working Group.  A draft agenda for the meeting is attached.

If you are unable to attend the meeting, or would like to provide written comments in addition to attendance, please provide them to the GISB office via email (contact:  gisb@aol.com) by December 3rd.  The work papers and comments received by December 3rd will be posted on GISB's web site (www.gisb.org) and emailed to all registered participants on December 4th.  The meeting will be transcribed and transcripts will be available for purchase.

The DOE has security procedures for visitors, so those intending to attend the meeting should notify the GISB office (contact: gisb@aol.com) by end of business Monday, December 3rd and provide the following information:

? Name of Attendee
? Company Represented
? Phone Number
? Email Address
? Fax Number
? Country of Citizenship

In addition to its normal security process, the DOE has additional security measures if should you bring in cell phones or laptop computers.  The auditorium has very limited number of power outlets for laptops, and it is advised not to bring them to the meeting.  Should you need to bring in a cell phone or a laptop, you should allow more time for a longer procedure for checking through security.   The auditorium has a seating capacity of 200, with limited standing room.  An attendance list will be provided to the DOE to facilitate the sign in procedures, and will be made available at the meeting.

Please feel free to contact Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 if you have any questions or comments.

FYI.  Note that we even had a meeting which included EES on 9/5 where the responsible party (Kelly Lovvorn) committed to certain tasks, which he obviously did not perform.  (Kelly is a contract employee.)  

Jim - there will be a charge (probably significant, especially for the ""emergency"" processing) from CSC to produce the required information.  There is some expectation that Government Affairs should be paying for it, especially since it will be a recurring item for several months.  Who should I go to to resolve this?

Unfortunately, no action was ever taken nor followed through on this request originally initiated 8/14/01, which has now

and CSC.

We're in the process of writing system specifications and will forward an ""emergency"" request for data to Brenda and CSC
this afternoon.   

Becky Cantrell will submit a request for an extension to FERC as soon as we determine how quickly CSC can produce the

I passed on all the details regarding data specifications and a high level overview of ENAs plan.

The EES data will need to be pulled from all Settlement applications which include HP9000, STAT, and Altra.  Kelly does
have a few programming resources available in house, yet he may need to request the information from CSC.  If that is the
case, there will be costs associated with the data pull and it will be much more difficult to validate the data.  In addition, there
may also be timing issues (????)....

I have asked Kelly to coordinate directly with you as he has questions/concerns.  You may want to check back with him in a few days to
workout target dates for your team to actually receive the information, who he should forward info to, etc...

Thanks,

dg

(note:  Just as an ""extra"" thought....as long as we Settle out of Altra/HP/Stat, all FERC data 
 requests (involving pricing w/ volumetric actuals) will need to come from those systems.)

Publicly, I am unsure thats what prompted my question about allegiance to the Independent Board members.  If we push for the EISB, there is a good chance the Independents will become obsolete.  The GISB process requiers stakesholder Board members.  The Independents may be able to remain on in some advisory capacity for reliability - but I don't think that will fly.  The whole purpose for the independent members was to ensure non-discriminatory decision making.

I will be presenting the EPSA position - which I will be working on with other EPSA folks, Mon and Tues.

Nancy --

Please keep John & Charles in the loop on this question.  They are both working on next steps for NERC and while not directly related to the RSB, there is potential for overlap down the road.

Also, where does Enron publicly stand on the incorporation of this into an EISB?  I thought we were ready to go?  Finally, are you giving the presentation?

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Subject: Tariff changes effective October 22, 2001


The following notice was posted on the Nominations Electronic Bulletin
Board today:


On October 12, 2001 the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved
Columbia's tariff filing to become effective on October 22, 2001, subject
to an Administrative Law Judge Recommendation.  This tariff filing includes
several changes that may be important to suppliers, such as changes in
Columbia's banking and balancing service, introduction of a new Flow Order
Management Service, and a new Imbalance Trading Service.

The full text of Columbia's original tariff proposals, as filed with the PA
Public Utility Commission on August 22, 2001, can be accessed at the
following site:

                                     h
ttp://www.columbiagaspamd.com/products_services/tariff_revisions_effective_oct.htm

Shippers serving aggregation pools on the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania,
Inc. system should carefully review Columbia's new Elective Balancing
Service (proposed tariff pages 164 - 169) and choose one of the three
balancing service options for each aggregation pool.  Also, suppliers who
have been designated as an authorized agent for non-aggregated customers
may choose an elective balancing option on behalf of those customers.
Columbia's current estimated rate for Option 1, Full Balancing Service, is
as follows:

SGS, SDS Customers  $0.20/Mcf
LDS, MLS  Customers $0.10/Mcf

Please note that Columbia's interruptible banking and balancing service
will no longer be available.  The cost for the interruptible service
($0.1109/Mcf for SGS and SDS, and $0.0358 for LDS and MLS) will be removed
from customers' distribution rates when the new Elective Balancing Services
become effective.

Under the newly approved Elective Balancing Service (Rider EBS), customers
or their authorized agents are given 20 days in which to elect their
service option.  Customers or their authorized agents who do not elect one
of the three Elective Balancing Service options on or before November 12,
2001 will default to Option 1, Full Balancing Service.  Columbia will post
final rates for Rider EBS Option 1 by the close of business on November 15,
2001.  If the final rates exceed the above estimated rates by more than
20%, customers or their authorized agents who have elected Option 1 may
change their election by submitting a change to Columbia in writing  by the
close of business on November 20, 2001.  Columbia will begin providing
service under the elected option as of December 1, 2001.

A form for the election of Rider EBS options will be e-mailed to the
""notices"" contact person for each supplier that is active on the Columbia
Gas of Pennsylvania systemwhen it is available.

Please contact your Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. representative at
412-572-7117 with any questions relating to these new services.


Attached are the forms and a brief outline of the changes.

Marc is out til next wednesday or so with surgery.  I already sent him an email to refocus.  This is not what I had expected.  I will talk to him next week when I get back.  However, Jim on your point that the ICC doesn't care if we lose market share, the premise of the anticompetitive argument is that the increase threatens our existing market share and prevents us from competing for more market.  That is the essence of the impact of an anticompetitive situation.  This would be the result not only for us but for others as well.

Where does this stand?  I just read the text and agree with Harry.  Most importantly, the HHI may not be suitable given the high degree of regulation of ComEd service.  

As important, I don't think the ICC cares too much about Enron losing market share.  Not the best lead argument.

Jim,

This is a 3 year deal, beginning Oct. 1.  Our standard terms and conditions, which MG has already executed, includes a ""regulatory"" out provision.  In addition, a change in law allows EES to terminate.

If ICAP or UCAP goes away, this would be a material change and EES would try to renegotiate the deal with MG or terminate if an acceptable deal cannot be reached.

Thanks - Jeff

BTW, I will be out of the office Monday-Thursday of next week.  I'll have a computer (if it works) and will call in for messages so if you need me, please leave me a message.  Thanks.

Subject:	American Thanksgiving
Importance:	High



A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? ""What we do in life echoes through eternity"".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to earn your trust and respect.  

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For those not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take some additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

Subject:	RE: California AG's Invesigator/Gray Davis' Customer Contact

We are considering four courses of action:  a suit against Gray Davis for tortious interference with contract; a suit for an injuntion against the AG; a letter of to our customers; and a letter to the press from one of our customers.  

California counsel is researching whether under California law state officials can be sued for tortious conduct.  The answer depends upon whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity that would normally protect it from such suits.  We may not have a definitive answer to this question until Monday.  If California law does provide for such a waiver, we could sue the Governor and the State for tortious interference with conduct.  

An additional obstacle to enjoining the AG is that the California statutes give the AG broad authority as to how he conducts an investigation.  Still, if we can get evidence that the AG's investigator is making untrue or misleading statements or engaging in some other misconduct (we would need an affidavit from a customer as proof), we could go into court to complain that the AG is abusing his authority.

A letter to our customers could cause Davis and Lockyer to back off.  Neither wants negative reports about them circulating among California businessmen (who they primarily see as potential campaign contributors).  The letter would lay out the ""truth about the California energy crisis and Davis/Lockyer's misguided and politically-motivated search for a scapegoat.""  We could perhaps use Judge Kobayashi's statement in the Dunn subpoena proceeding that the California energy crisis was ""created in part by all arms of the California government"" to support our case.  We could also use published reports (if verifiable) about the DWR's imprudent purchases of power, and cast the AG's investigation as an attempt to divert attention from Davis/Lockyer's lack of any success in addressing the the crisis.  We could thank our customers for not being swayed by the demagogery and rhetoric, and for continuing to be our business partners.  We would want this to be positive in tone.

A fourth response would be a letter from one (or more) of our customers to a newspaper complaining about the harassment by the AG's office.  This letter could make some of the same points as the letter from us to our customers. 

We are still thinking of other approaches.  We will have the answers to the legal questions buttoned up by Monday at the latest.  Please call me with any questions or comments (x52402).

David Tagliarino, Enron Sports Marketing Group, received a call today from John Yee, CFO of the SF Giants.  David, John and I got back on the phone this morning.  Following is a summary of our discussion:

John Yee, CFO, SF Giants, received a letter from the CA AG's office requesting their cooperation in an ""....investigation concerning Enron...."".  (John will fax that letter to me and I will circulate it)
John called the AG's office per their request in the letter received
The AG's office was digging for a bunch of information:
total MWH consumed
contract start date
term of contract
general questions about T's & C's
whether Enron had cancelled the contract
who was supplying electricity
copies of the agreements and letters of communication from Enron to the SF Giants
John was generally responsive and indicated that Enron has been great, has honored its contract, still has a contract in place, etc.
John pushed back on supplying any more information without a written request from the AG's office, and then also indicated that they would only supply what was required by law
The AG's office responded by indicating that they may have to subpoena the Giants
John will wait and see what the AG's office does
He will keep us in the communication loop and make sure that we have copies of the communication from the AG's office

Thanks - Dan

Subject:	Cornell University Experiment on Market Prices

Cornell has published a report of 4 experiments conducted to test market trading behavior and its impact on electricity prices under different price auctions. 

1) uniform price auction
2) uniform price with interruptible loads
3) discriminative auction - generators are paid their actual offers
4) soft-cap auction 

The study is fascinating as real subjects were employed and paid real dollars based on their trading performance.  The findings are consistent with our arguments against price caps - particularly soft caps as installed in California.   I think there is some ""empirical"" data that can be used in our arguments against price caps.  

More variations of the auctions aimed at testing some assumptions used in these 4 experiments are planned, and industry is invited to participate in the experiments.

The Commission denied the requests for rehearing (including Enron's) of the Commission's July 25 order on reporting requirements for California natural gas transactions.  The Commission finds that the information is necessary for FERC to better understand how the California natural gas market operates so the Commission can determine whether anything else is needed to be done to protect consumers.  Also, FERC states that the information is necessary for the Commission to advise Congress on whether Congress needs to change the regulatory framework that FERC works under.

A more detailed summary will be provided shortly.  Please let us know if you have any questions.

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those ""involuntarily"" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the ""effective date"" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

"RE: ComEd Imbalance Issues","Janine --

The other thing that I am thinking is that we don't want to file anything at the FERC without a broad coalition.  At the right time (after we understand the facts and our desired outcomes), let's sit down and discuss how to approach FERC.  I think the timing is right to make a cogent, well-defined argument before FERC but we need to sell this to the FERC before the filing and we need to have Enron as a minor player in the fight.  The FERC is looking to help retail markets.

Jim, Let me look into this further.  My concern is that the imbalance provisions are something we may have agreed to in the settlements which would make us look bad should we file a complaint.  Jeff Merola has been working on how we can do physical delivery and how we can address this issue.  I know he thinks it is a roadblock, but not necessarily an insurmountable one.  On the other hand, this is another way to focus on the issue of wanting a PJM-type model and perhaps the next step would be to educate ICC Commissioners and Staff on the problem.  If we approcah it as a need for a PJM - type model, it should not antagonize our efforts of working with ComEd at the moment, since they have said they would like help moving in that direction.

Jim,
Per your request, below is an email from Chris Townsend explaining the imbalance program.  I plan to call him to get a better handle on the discount issue, but I think that it is useful that marketers can trade imbalances, but the benefit is premised on there being many suppliers.  More to follow when I return.

As you might recall from the memo summarizing the 1999 Edison DST
proceeding, the Illinois Commerce Commission essentially ""punted"" on the
imbalance issue, instead deferring to FERC.  Attached is the section from
our memo that discussed the imbalance issue.  It is my recollection that the
issue of establishing subaccounts was not addressed.  We will try to confirm
this tomorrow.

As lawyers, please do not hesitate to call or email if we can be of any

		Energy Imbalances

		1.	Jurisdictional Issues

	The ARES Coalition, Alliant, and IIEC argued that the Commission
should address energy imbalances in the proceeding.  Enron and NewEnergy
abandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison.
Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly
addressed within Edison's OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.


	The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted
litigation and the harm of delay to retail competition, the Commission would
not address the propriety of FERC's asserted authority over energy imbalance
issues.  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way
""waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at
some future time.""

		2.	Factual & Policy Issues

	Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers
containing the following provisions:

*	Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and
settlements will occur on a cash basis for each hour's imbalances;
*	For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2% or less, or 2
MW or less, settlement is made at 100% of out-of-pocket costs (""OPC""),
regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error;
*
*	Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25% of their own
individual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25% of
OPC.  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discounts
applicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount
below.  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows:
*
*	From October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 -- No adder  will
apply under this provision.
*
*	From January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount
will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 20%
or more of the hours of the month.  If the 20% of the hours are exceeded,
the adder/discount shall apply to all hours.
*
*	Starting April 1, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount will apply to those
RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 10% or more of the hours
of the month.  If the 10% of the hours are exceeded, the adder/discount
shall apply to all hours.

*	Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance
attributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs.  If the hourly
imbalance caused by all unbundled retail load, excluding PPO load, is within
the 100 MW bandwidth, no RES (except those whose imbalance exceeds ?25%, as
noted below) will be subject to an adder or discount.  PPO load will, in
aggregate, be subject to the same terms and conditions as above, but
imbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadband
separately from all RES load.

*	Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves,
to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish, before
applying a charge for energy imbalance.  According to Edison, this feature
will allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging
overscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the same
hour.  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100% of Edison's
OPC.  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the
opening of the trading window.
*
*	The net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be charged
an adder or discount of 10%.  This charge will be allocated among RESs who
are out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds
their individual deadband.  The allocation will be based on the ratio-share
of the amount by which these individual RESs' imbalances exceed their
individual deadbands.  Any such adder/discount will be billed separately
from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading. Likewise, any
adder/discount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billed
separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading.
*
*	Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with
seasonal adjustments.  Edison will not require the installation of interval
demand recorders for customers of less than 400 kW at this time.
*
*	Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth (i.e.,
no adders/discounts) when the imbalances are due to (1) Edison interruptions
and restorations, or (2) customer force majeure events, that are in each
case material to the RESs' schedule and of which the RES could not
reasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule.
*
*	Edison will include a description of the methodology for determining
OPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC.

	The IIEC opposed Edison's proposal and requested that the Commission
require Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distribution
level.  Blackhawk also opposed Edison's proposal and supported the IIEC
proposal  Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energy
imbalance service at the distribution level.  Mid-American opposed any
effort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances.

	The Commission failed to weigh-in on the energy imbalance issue
consistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum for
such issues.  The Commission reserved the right to address the issue in some
future FERC proceeding.

Do we have to do something related to this?  Thanks.

Note also that in a separate development FERC
simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section
206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide.
What this means is that, although only three utilities are
mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC
will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes
to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30
companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to
determine if the commission believes they exert market
power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires
power providers with market-based sales authority to amend
their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with
open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission
determines that market manipulation has occurred.

Subject:	RTOs and Market Monitoring




The structure of an independent market monitor is arising in the RTO proceedings.  These are some thoughts:

Market monitor should have the ability to monitor the activities of the RTO and the markets.  For example, if the RTO is a transco, it is appropriate for the MM to review whether the RTO is doing something potentially problematic in planning, ATC calcs, etc.
MM should only have the ability to recommend changes to market structure, possible penalties, etc.  MM should not have the ability to issue a penalty to any one without first going to FERC.  It is possible that the MM could ask for FERC pre-approval to issue ""penalties"" or remedies for certain conduct.  The example that comes to mind is the $1000 price cap in PJM.  It has been approved at FERC and if someone bids above it, the MM could reduce the bid to $1000 without going to FERC again.
MM has no authority that FERC does not have.  (I have heard some (outside of Enron) people state that the MM should have authority to do things that FERC could not do.)
Market participants should always retain their right to go to FERC before providing documents in response to an MM request and should retain right to go to FERC even if there is an arbitration clause (should not be required to agree to binding arbitration).
Ultimately, FERC staff could provide the MM function.

Let me know any comments ASAP please (since I have comments due on this Friday for the SE RTO).  Thanks.

"RE: CPUC Authority to Adjust Rates","Jeanne --

Not quite sure that I am getting the picture.  Let me lay it out more directly.

The PX Credit for October 2000 was $225 based on the actual market rates.

Now FERC is saying that October 2000 hourly prices for CalPX DA and CalPX HA markets were ""too high"" in June 2001.  Can the CPUC change the PX Credit for October 2000 and make the Utilities recalculate our Negative CTC?

What is prospective?  Have they ever done this before?

Subject:	CPUC Authority to Adjust Rates

Jeff and Jim --

I have done some research into the issue of whether the CPUC would be able
to restate the UDC's PX Energy Charges (and thus PX Credits) back to October
if the FERC were to apply its mitigation plan back that far. Thus far, my
research indicates that the answer is yes (or at least there is a strong
argument that the answer is yes) and it would not violate the rule against
retroactive rate making.  The reasoning is as follows:

The Commission (as affirmed by the courts) have ruled that they may subject
a utility's rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to a
methodology or formula adopted before the date the utility's rates became
subject to refund. Thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because the
formulas are in place before the utility's rates are made subject to refund.
The PX Energy Charge is calculated pursuant to the formula/mechanism set
forth in the utility's tariffs.  These charges were always subject to
adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process.  The change
in energy prices which would be effected by the FERC ruling could very well
be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula.  Thus the change
would not be considered retroactive ratemaking.

I had a chance to talk with Mike Day for a couple of minutes about this
issue.  He concurred with my analysis.

Jeanne

Subject:	Southeast RTO: Southern's Load



The Barton discussion draft says that FERC's hands would be tied and that they would have to approve a proposed RTO, as to size and scope, if the proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities that serve at least 40,000 MW of load.  Southern's CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over 35,000.  I assume the 40,000 MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis, as I understand it.  Is this correct?

Who would know how many RTOs there would be if each were just over the 40,000 MW minimum?  I assume it is much more than 4-5 RTOs -- if so, this is a good contrast to use in our Hill efforts.

Thanks.

What are going to do would be my question.  Can you get their wire instructions just in case.  Also, I assume those are pre-petition amounts.  If so, I would clarify to the group.

I agree with your statement that we don't need an RTO, we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules.  It's important to keep consistent messages.

Jim -- Would Entergy in Texas have a PPO?  In your testimony at the Texas PUC we argued that a retail program doesn't necessarily need an RTO -- it does need the ability to go physical on a fair basis, including rational imbalance provisions of the TP OATT--not punitive.  Here we are stating that there should be a continuation of ComEd's PPO until there is a functioning wholesale market, including a good imbalance provision.  Should the argument go more toward that retail physical could work if ComED changed certain tariff provisions now, even without a PPO?

Subject:	ICC Meeting

The ICC Energy Committee held a meeting to discuss ComEd's proposal to drop the PPO.  We argued that this should not be allowed until the wholesale market/delivery issues are dealt with because otherwise customers will have no choice but to return to ComEd at the higher bundled rate.  The good news is that a rather lengthy discussion on this issue ensued as a result.  The industrial customer group and Mid American Energy supported our views; however AES New Energy said that this was not a problem for them.

We also commented that once the PPO goes away it should not be resurrected due to the uncertainty it would create in the market.  ComEd responded that under the statute they can not offer to waive the PPO but could negotiate an arrangement on the CTC if approached by the customer.  This would mean that we could negotiate on behalf of all our customers regarding the CTC.  

We have the opportunity to file comments to the Commissioners before the actual filing.  A draft is attached. 

 << File: Commissioner Terry Harvill.doc >> 

If you have any comments, please respond by the end of the week.

I would say, no downside to supporting implementation of Settlement proceedings.  As one of the customers replied yesterday afternoon: ""Count Phelps Dodge Corporation ""in"" for settlement conferences - possible certainty through settlement is preferable to several years of litigation.""  I'd bet that FERC would be thrilled to see a settlement proposal, even one that was contested, given - as you say - that they are swamped with other issues.  With no settlement, any decision they issue that disadvantages one segment is sure to be litigated.  At least with a settlement, they stand a chance of getting something out of the process even though they might not get everything they want.

Feedback from Janie, presumably cleared by the Desk:  ""I am deferring this to you but I don't see any reason we would have any problem with this  either.""

Subject:	RE: MG Load Curtailment Option

Howard,

Since this will be a financial deal initially that could be physical in the future, I have only included the value of the day-ahead program in our model.  Thus if we elect to become the physical provider during the 36 months, we will have an incremental benefit.  However, if we never become the physical provider, I need to know that I will be paid in the Day Ahead program for reducing load.

Three key regulatory issues:

1.  NYISO has an Hour-Ahead market that load needs to be allowed to participate in.  This would  clearly increase the value of the MG deal and our NY products in general.
2.  The Day-Ahead Demand Response Program needs to remain in-tact.  This allows EES to realize the value of our call options, whether we are financial or physical.  
3.  The baseline calculation for load reduction does not work.  This summer, one of IBM's sites reduced load by 2 MW's, which is clear when reviewing this usage curves on the day of curtailment.  However, when comparing to their CBL (as currently defined) there was no reduction and therefore no payment for IBM or EES.  As we have discussed, NY should look at ISO-New England's baseline calculations.  This is a much better approach for Enron and our customers.

Thanks - Jeff

Jim: I have participated in a number of calls with Jeff and his team over the past few weeks regarding this deal, goving over the details of how NY's demand response programs work, reviewing draft contracts, and putting him in touch with appropriate ISO staff when even more detailed followup was needed. I see little likelihood of NY's demand response programs being eliminated over the next few years given the increasingly tight supply situation the state faces and the long lead time for permitting and bulding new generation, and the great success these programs achieved this past summer. (Most folks credit the 600 MW produced by NY's day-ahead and emergency demand response programs with keeping the lights on in the northeast during the early August heat wave.) Only the day-ahead incentive program has a risk of not being continued beyond October 2003, it's current expiration date. However, even there, there is likely to be pressure to extend it for an additional year or two. With respect to potential RTO impacts, in our discussions with PJM, they have stated that at a minimum they would allow NY to continue its demand response programs in the new Northeast market on day 1, even if they differed from the rest of the region.Further, PJM would even consider making the NY programs applicable throughout the region on day 1 if that was what the market participants in the region wanted to do.

Subject:	Draft Decision on DWR Revenue Requirement

The Commission issued a draft decision yesterday (September 4) on DWR's
revenue requirement.  While the Commission had been scheduled to vote on the
revenue requirement at tomorrow's (September 6) meeting, the vote has been
postponed to allow for comments on the PD.  Comments are due on September
11th.  Cmmr. Lynch stated at her press conference held today that it  was
her intent to vote on the PD no later than the next regularly scheduled
Commission meeting on September 20th, and perhaps earlier if a continuation
meeting can be scheduled.


The PD approves the entirety of DWR's requested revenue requirement of $12.6
less the costs of certain demand side management programs which are not
included as ""authorized costs"" under AB1X.  The PD does not follow DWR's
approach of a pro rata allocation of the revenue requirement among the three
UDCs.  Rather the PD follows a ""cost of service"" approach.  The PD allocates
DWR's energy procurement costs on a geographic basis, depending on whether
the energy is delivered over facilities in northern California or Southern
California (Transmission Path 15 is the line of demarcation).  Energy
sources procured north of Path 15 are allocated to PG&E customers and those
procured south of Path 15 are allocated to SCE and SDG&E customers.  The
result of such allocation is to have 54% of DWR costs allocated to PG&E, 33%
to SCE and 13% to SDG&E.  Each of the UDCs are then allocated the same
percentage of bond proceeds.  In revenue requirement terms this means that
for the period of January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002, PG&E is
allocated $6.53 billion; SCE is allocated $4.01 billion and SDG&E is
allocated $1.53 billion.

Along with the revenue requirement allocation, the PD adopts a DWR charge
for each UDC.  The UDCs are directed to begin dispersing payment to DWR
based on the relevant DWR charge for each kWh sold by DWR to the UDC's
customer.  For PG&E this charge is 13.99 cents/ kWh; for SCE the charge is
10.03 cents/kWh; and for SDG&E the charge is 9.02 cents/kWh.  The PD also
notes that given the fact that PG&E's DWR charge is  !3.99 cents it may need
to remit to DWR an additional 4  cents for each kWh that was provided to its
customers by DWR since June 1 until this order becomes effective.

As for the necessity of raising PG&E and SCE rates to account for the DWR
revenue requirement, the PD states that such a determination cannot be made
until a decision on the revenue requirement for the UDCs' retained
generation is issued.  That proposed  decision is due out later this month.



If you have any questions or would like a copy of the order, please contact
me.

Privileged and Confidential 

Lisa and Michael,

I  talked with two representatives from PG&E today, Robert Orbeta and Fong Wan, regarding the reconciliation of amounts included in Enron's Proof Of Claim, which total almost $404 million dollars,  to the books and records of PG&E.  Both Robert and Fong agree that 1) no significant differences have been found, 2) the total variance, including IBM,  is approximately $2 million dollars, and 3) the reconciliation is substantially complete and therefore, the results should not change materially.  Diann Huddleson will call her counterpart, Mike Alexander,  this afternoon to request a schedule, by account, of these variances.  As you know, Enron's Proof of Claim is a compilation of charges/credits reflected on PG&E invoices, and therefore, the only differences should have been the result of omissions, duplications, or other query failures.  All things being equal, the reconciliation should have been a simple comparison, but at an account level.  The sheer number of accounts for several months of activity,  made this reconciliation a challenge. 

Both Robert and Fong made remarks regarding Enron's claim for the IBM dual bill accounts.  Mr.  Fong also commented that another outstanding item, in his opinion, was the ""FERC refund case"".   I suggested that these items be included on the agenda for the settlement discussions scheduled for next week. 

Let me know if you need anything further. 

Thanks,
Wanda

Please keep John & Charles in the loop on this question.  They are both working on next steps for NERC and while not directly related to the RSB, there is potential for overlap down the road.

Also, where does Enron publicly stand on the incorporation of this into an EISB?  I thought we were ready to go?  Finally, are you giving the presentation?

Subject:	ComEd wants to limit power purchase option

Attached is an article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune this morning
regarding Edison's presentation to yesterday's ICC Electric Policy Committee
Meeting that we thought you would find to be of interest.


From the Chicago Tribune
ComEd wants to limit power purchase option
By Melita Marie Garza
Tribune staff reporter

October 17, 2001

Commonwealth Edison Co. on Tuesday proposed weaning its largest commercial
and industrial customers from a power purchase plan that the company asserts
stifles competition in the state's emerging market for electricity.

Under the proposal, the utility would differentiate between industrial
customers that use less than 400 kilowatts of electricity at any given
moment and those that use more, Pamela Strobel, ComEd's chairman, told the
Illinois Commerce Commission. A standard Jewel or Dominick's grocery store
uses about 400 kilowatts of electricity at a given moment, Strobel said.

Under deregulation, corporate customers have three options: Stay with
ComEd's standard regulated electricity service based on rates set in 1996,
pick an alternative supplier or opt for ComEd's so-called Power Purchase
Option.

Customers who pick the last option get ComEd's market rate but are allowed
to choose ComEd competitors as their primary power suppliers.

ComEd's proposal would bar its largest customers from that option, which the
utility says has stymied deregulation because it allows competing suppliers
to merely resell the power that ComEd produced.

""So long as the utility is providing this option, real competitive markets
won't work,"" said Arlene Juracek, ComEd's vice president for regulatory and
strategic services. ""Some suppliers have taken the easy way out by telling
their customers to sign up for the plan.""

Terry Harvill, an ICC member, agreed. ""There was an unintended problem ...
rather than alternative suppliers coming into Illinois with diverse sources
of energy, essentially you have them just taking power from ComEd and
reselling it to customers,"" Harvill said.

Specifically, ComEd proposes to limit the Power Purchase Option to
non-residential customers paying competitive transition charges, effective
June 2002. The transition charges cover costs incurred by the utility prior
to deregulation.

""I think it's a step in the right direction, but the details remain to be
worked out,"" Harvill said. He noted that companies still would have the
option to fall back on ComEd's traditional regulated plan.

But Marty Cohen, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, was
skeptical.

""There are certain inherent conflicts in the way that Edison sees the world
because they are a subsidiary of a much larger company--Exelon--which is, in
fact, the largest producer and seller of electricity in this market,"" Cohen
said.

""So you have ComEd on the one hand being the largest buyer of electricity,
and you have Exelon, its parent company, being the largest seller of
electricity. This proposal doesn't address that issue.""

Jim,

Its been a long time and I hope post the New York incident everything is fine your end.

You must have had a feel of how things are evolving in our Indian office, from Amr. We are appearing to win some Court cases, but the case is dragging on. However with the Tata's (An Indian private company) showing interest in our project, things might hasten a bit. The most preferable solution from our standpoint is a buyout and we are hoping for it.

Meanwhile I understand there are a lot of changes happening in the department in Houston. I would strongly like to be a part of the group in Houston. With things in India heading towards a close, I really do not know how long my services would be required here. Going by the last months severances one is expecting another month, at max two before I too am on laid off.

The severance package is the attractive part (6 months + 2 months notice period - the latter part might be optional), but any day a continuation in Enron is always preferable. Having worked for you and Amr, I am always looking forward to continuing my association with you both if that be possible.

If you have something in mind wherein I can chip in and contribute I would be very happy to do so. I can contact Linda and seek an appointment for you in that case. It would be a pleasure for me if I can start working for you once again.

I look forward to hearing from you
Warm Regards
Ban

**I suggest you send a brief message to Jim and copy Amr.  In the message I would say that you understand that there is a lot of change going on in the department, but that you want to reiterate your strong interest in working with the group from Houston.  Perhaps then you suggest that you contact Linda (his assistant) to schedule a time to talk in more detail (assuming this is possible in spite of the time difference). 

**In addition to this, have you considered moving yourself and family to the U.S. and then finding a job?  If you do get a severence package then you could use the money for that.

thanks a ton jennifer. but thanks to the portland fiasco relations between me and Amr are not the same again. In short I have lost faith in people. He did mention about this fundamentals group, but did not mention that he was heading it or that he is looking to hire people.

lets hope for the best and see how things evolve. however the best part of the houston trip, apart from the value additions professionally, was that I got to meet good people like Jim, Rick and you. I am pretty contended with that. This however does in no way mean that i would not try for any opening in houston. i am doubly or should i say triply motivated now (post the arrival of the kid) to seek all options that would lead me to the US.

How are things your end. has the house been sold off or are you still struggling to find a buyer? where would you be this christmas - portland i presume appears the most likely place. how is steve, convey my regards to him.

You probably already talked to Amr about this, but it was just announced that he is going to be informally putting together a ""fundamentals"" group within this department.  It seems to me that this is something you would be interested in.  If you haven't already, I would ask him about it.  Also, he is probably a lot better able than I to give you a good idea about where this group is headed and whether he foresees any openings.

We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  

It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.

My reading of a memo that SCE sent is that we have a deposit requirement of ~$23MM and that it needs to increase.  It wasn't clear whether that deposit was satisfied with cash, bond or LC. In all areas where we are billing our clients for power and T&D, we may have the opportunity to go to dual billing and receive deposits back, as well as to stop funding the PG&E escrow account.  I would imagine that the tariff provides for our deposits only to be netted against a deficiency in our T&D payments, where we are probably 100% current.

We need to aggregate where we think we have this opportunity and take action today.

I am copying a lot of people on here to try and get as many sources thinking about this as possible.  Dan indicated to me that SCE appears to have a sizable deposit from us on hand (around $20MM) and is asking for more.  How can we trackdown/schedule out all of our deposits.  I would like to think we have them all in a deposit account on our balance sheet, but that is not likely (although Kim, Cindy and Mary Lynne should scour that).

Does anybody have any ideas?????

"MY THOUGHTS ON BALANCED SCHEDULES IN ERCOT","LUIZ --  Attached is a version that I changed.  Mainly formattting the intro.  I think that our current draft is too long without a short synopsis up front. We want a White Paper that reads like an advocacy piece.  Please add to whatever you are doing.  Also, move forward with contacting Larry Ruff for (1) his analysis of your and my combined draft and (2) a simple affadavit on this.  Govt Affairs will pay up to $10k for this work out of our current budget.  We need to have this finished by Tuesday EOB.  

CHARLES -- We need to make sure that Monday and Tuesday someone calls everyone on the Committee considering changing these rules on Thursday.  Let's get the list and start lobbying actively.  Call me if you have any questions.  Please talk with Doug Gilbert-Smith about who and where.  Maybe Christi and Jean Ryall can help.

CHRISTI -- Pls make sure that Steve Walton and Sarah Novosel are ok with this statements.

I am assuming that there is at least one willing member who was also a formal party to the proceeding which resulted in the Preferred Policy Decision.  Was the Alliance a formal party to that proceeding?
 
The basic structure of the Petition is complete.  I shall complile the Exhibits and then review same to determine whether the citations and to add any arguments which have been overlooked.
 
I would like to file on November 9.  I think that this Petition and the Commonwealth Petition should be filed on the same day.  If you concur, I will coordinate with Commonwealth's counsel.

I have spoken to Mark, he will send a list of issues to Nancy prior to the hearing.  The committee will acknowledge that you are an Enron employee, however, you are appearing in the capacity of  Chair of RMS subcomittee.  Bill B. from Ercot will be present, however he was not the most stellar witness.  Mark thinks Chairman Wolens will want to hear directly from the Chair of RMS.  The questions that you may be asked include:  what has RMS recommended to TAC, address issues of cutover from version 1.3 to 1.4...where are we, where do we go next, where are the participants on the issue?  Mark is preparing the list of questions and will email it to you soon.
 
Representative Paul Hilbert died last night.  If the funeral services are scheduled for Friday, the hearing will be postponed to enable the members of the committee to attend the funeral.  We may not know the date of the funeral until Wednesday.  I will let everyone know ASAP whether or not the legislative takes place on Friday.  Thanks, Jean

I checked the meeting calendar and the NERC hospitality and dinner is during the time we agreed to meet over dinner.  I suggesting changing our plans for a dinner meeting on Monday evening, Oct 15 to that morning instead.

I think if you check on flights from Houston to Vancouver, it will be tricky to get to Vancouver from Houston the morning of Oct 15 to make it in time to the Stakeholder meeting which starts at 1:00 pm.   It may be better to fly in Sunday night from Houston anyway.

What do you all think?  Lets coordinate so we can get the flights right.

Subject:	MOU - Update

The following are some of the proposed amendments to SBX2 78, in concept.
The amendments were developed by the Administration and Assembly Democratic
leadership and have not been finalized, nor have they been run past the
Senate in full detail.  It is unlikely that the Assembly will take the bill
up this week.

Direct Access: SBX2 78 will contain the final DA provisions from ABX2 82
which are located in Water Code Section 80110.  The amendments, in short,
provide that customers may switch during open enrollment periods provided
that there is enough head room and in proportion to the customer class.  The
Assembly has apparently convinced the Treasurer that DA can exist provided
there are non-bypassable charges and specified exit fees.

Threshold: The payment threshold will be lowered to 20 kw for 100% of the
undercollection despite the Senate's objections.  Lowering the threshold to
20 kw will probably force some of the liberal Democrats off the bill but
will bring even more of the moderate Democrats on to the bill.

Tax Refund: SCE will keep the $400 million projected tax refund and not have
that amount applied towards the bonding amount.

Easements: The easements are currently in the bill, however, they may need
to come out in order to secure moderate Democratic votes.

Renewable Portfolio Standard:  The RPS from ABX2 82 will be included in SBX2
78.

Attached is the first draft of our intervention in the Georgia Power rate case.
 << File: Georgia Power Case3.doc >> 

Our goals are to get:
Georgia Power's weather risk transferred to the market through purchase of weather hedges, in lieu of GP's proposal to refund a portion of above normal weather revenues in exchange for supposedly bearing downside weather risk (for EGM, principally);
Disclosure of new capacity contracts whose costs are proposed to be recovered through a new automatic capacity recovery mechanism, to help our own ability to hedge existing retail positions (for EWS);
Application of an earnings test that would limit when the capacity cost recovery mechanism goes into place, to help keep down rate increases on our existing retail positions (for EWS);
A reduction in GP's ROE if the automatic capacity recovery mechanism is approved; to limit rate increases on our existing retail positions (for EWS).

Andy and Mark, please give me your suggestions.  I will schedule follow-ups as needed.  Mark, I have talked to Gary Taylor and he is working up some hedge examples that will be very useful.  Also, Bob Frank and I had a very general discussion with Dynegy about our issues.  They have intervened in this case also and may be supportive.  Do you have any objection to sharing our views with them?  They could be very helpful.  

Mike, I think this is the first rate case where Enron is intervening in a closed state (Georgia).  It's certainly likely other parties will want to know our interests.  Most of the retail position is from Springs, Owens Corning, Quebecor, Rich, and Simon.  Another half-dozen contracts also have positions there.  I want to make sure you have no objection to Enron's participation.  Any suggestion on how best to characterize our interest would be great.

We have four weeks before this must be finalized so there is time.  But hearings start next week for GP's witnesses so any immediate feedback in terms of direction, etc. would be great.

Thank you.

PennFuture's E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market.

September 26, 2001
Vol. 3, No. 18

Straight to the Source

Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news. Importantly, the merger settlement provided $32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania.

This year, the company's wholesale trading and marketing unit, Power Team, presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania. These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement, and are not included in the $32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding.

Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East, the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms, two of which will be operational next month. The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week, and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week.

Mike Freeman, the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible, gave us some insight into Exelon's renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into America's power grids.
---------------------------------
What's in Power Team's renewable portfolio?
We have 525 MW of hydro that is not pumped storage, 150 MW of wind, 100 MW of landfill methane, 35 MW of Municipal Solid Waste, 20 MW of wood waste, and 16 MW of scrap tires.

All of the wind is Green-e certifiable as ""new"" resources. All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e, but only 10 MW is new generation. Of the hydro, all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards. The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e, but the biomass plant is.

Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio?
There were two principal reasons: a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace, and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel, emissions, and cost.

Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome?
I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business. I don't think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases. Part of the hands-off approach was due to, I believe, a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation, not changing the power system in any way.

Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system. For me that's the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development. I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable, and that demand for these products could be sustaining.

Will this encourage new development?
Generators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location, but is also willing to talk about additional new projects. Over time, other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same. If this chain of events occurs, I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter, just like other energy products now.

How do renewables fit into Power Team's overall business strategy?
We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio. So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy. More specifically, we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy, not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards, but also because of natural demand. The average person may not think of it this way, but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements.

Why Wind?
There's no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements, under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects. A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998, and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year. A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years, and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand, including supply-side and demand-side solutions. We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources.

What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal?
The first is probably the need for a long-term contract. Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price, long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period. We don't have a problem with long-term deals per se, although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well. We don't want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else.

In my discussions with generators so far, there has been some flexibility on contract length. In fact, our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built. Beyond the long-term contract, the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating. Exelon Generation is rated A- by S&P so we are a natural counter-party for project financing. Right now, there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have.

Will that always will be the case?
No. If we're right about long-lasting demand, I think other large companies, including distribution companies, will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects. We've teamed up with a retail marketer, Community Energy, to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it. In the development of conventional generation, it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built. For example, a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods. And in some cases, the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing.

Is there a financial advantage for wind?
If one's view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value, a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have. Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility. This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present.

It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term. But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project, outside of significant advances in technology. Over a long period of time, 15 or 20 years, I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite.

I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years.

Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio?
With conventional generation and firm transmission paths, a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets, whether they are hourly, daily, monthly, or longer. Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing, amount and ultimate sink of expected output.

The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100% of the time as possible, so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesn't match scheduled energy. The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different, because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy.

I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio. We're one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix.

How does intermittent generation add complexity?
A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows, not when you flip the switch on. It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency, even for an experienced organization like ours, because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind. You don't have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand.

In PJM, where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis, and receive (or pay) market-clearing prices depending on actual generation, wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties. An obstacle, and we're working with PJM on this right now, is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity. For purposes of regulating the system, PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate, or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand.

This will not be practical with wind generation. We'd literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do. In the must-run scenario, we'd still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators. Either way, we'd have to predict output, which is a dicey
proposition.

Does that make wind generation unreliable?
Not at all. We've got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time, such as a full year. Those predictions underlie our contracts. But it's another thing to tell the wind when to blow. The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what I've described. In PJM, a 54,000 MW system, this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now, but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives. A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system.

The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution.

How can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind?
An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as ""negative"" load instead of generation. Which is to say, when the plant is generating electricity, the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating. When the plant is not generating, the load will increase. A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve. In this unique circumstance, which of the ancillary services apply to negative load, and at what level? We're working with PJM on these questions.

I'm uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider. Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load, and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way. Other countries, and the western U.S. transmission systems, have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation, and so can we.

Are you working on other approaches?
Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market, to a control area that does have such a market. The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis.  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment. However, notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach.

Will PJM resolve these problems?
Yes. PJM is progressive and innovative, and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the scheduling/imbalance issue. It's hard now because we're breaking new ground. I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed.

How big might your renewable portfolio get? Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects?
As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy, we'll continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy. I'd like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market, such as PJM, to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output.

We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed. We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on. If we execute a contract successfully, we'd like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company. Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp. and National Wind Power.

What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster?
We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment, standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation, financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing, and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage.

Perhaps most importantly, we need consumers to buy the wind energy!

Subject:	Meeting with Dan Larcamp/ Marketing Affiliate Rulemaking


Leslie Lawner, Becky Cantrell and I met with Dan Larcamp at FERC yesterday to discuss the marketing affiliate issue.  He agreed with the latest press reports that the upcoming rulemaking NOPR, expected to be voted out in September, would not make major structural changes to the industry.  The current document is up to the Commission level and the Commissioners are clearly considering the alternatives now.  Larcamp said he expected a broadening of the current market affiliate rules structure to include all corporate entities.  He did specifically mention that the Commission is not comfortable with the link between financial and physical transactions and the possibility for manipulation of market prices in one market (financial) to affect prices in the other market (physical).  He also expects the Commission to blend the gas and power rules, using the best practices of each.  Any NOPR that is issued will of course have comment dates to allow Enron and all industry participants to comment on any proposed rule changes.

Larcamp indicated that he did not think there were pervasive afilliate discrimination issues in the industry, but said that the Commission needed to act due to the political pressures they got from the Hill, etc.  The El Paso case is top on everyone's mind and is of special concern because it affects the California market, both gas and power. 

Larcamp indicated that he is just now learning what a ""Pat Wood"" Commission is going to want.  He indicated that Wood has closer ties to the producer community than either of the two former Chairmen.  He therefore expects  that the Commission will be responsive to that sector in taking a relook at the affiliate rules.  However, Larcamp did mention that the only meeting that he had previously had on the affiliate issue was with the INGAA group (Joe Hartsoe went with them).  It is not clear whether the producer community has lobbied this issue at the Commissioner level.

We discussed strategy with Dan, how to let the Commission feel more comfortable with the marketing affiliate issue.  He suggested that he had gained a lot by visiting the trading floors (including Enron's).  He thought the Commissioners and their immediate staffs would benefit from similar visits.  

We specifically raised the issue of market prices, and talked about tranportation costs not equalling basis differentials.  We stated that our marketers believed that the prices in the market were determined by market factors in the specific areas of delivery rather than basin costs plus transport costs.  Dan did indicate some agreement with this concept and thought that more education at the Commissioner level would be very worthwhile.

If you have any questions, call Leslie, Becky or me.

Subject: RE: EPSA MBR Paper




        Erin, 
        Thanks for the advance copy of the paper.  While there are a number of very good points made in the paper, Williams has a fundamental problem with EPSA endorsing a new market power test that is more stringent than we think is necessary.  We would recommend that EPSA support the Limited Competing Supplier Test, or perhaps simply take the position in option 5 (no test for bid-based markets operated by an ISO or RTO).  We simply believe that EPSA should not be ""negotiating with itself"" at this juncture.  That is, we should not assume that the majority of the Commissioners are with Massey.  We should use this paper to argue to the other Commissioners and staff that if they move off Hub and Spoke, they only need to move incrementally, not dramatically.  In making this recommendation we recognize that this may not be enough for FERC and we may not like what we end up with.  But Williams is simply not prepared to support a position we really don't agree with in the hope that we can avoid an even worse result.  I particularly recall Linda Breathitt's reservations about these issues (voiced at the meeting a month ago) and am hopeful that we can influence Wood and Brownell in this regard.

        The language that reiterates EPSA's position that FERC's primary focus should be on getting market design right is very well done.  Also the arguments on why it would be disastrous to condition our market based rate authority is well done and timely.

        We recognize that EPSA has been working on this issue for weeks now, but this is not a simple issue and we have needed this time to think it through.  We appreciate your efforts and believe this is an important issue for EPSA.   Thanks, Judy Neason

PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENT: THE CAEM GRID ENHANCEMENT FORUM
 
PROMPT REPLY REQUESTED.
 
A slew of new power control, management, transmission and storage technologies are becoming available in the power marketplace to reduce congestion, enhance performance and improve reliability.  These technologies carry great promise for addressing some of the challenges currently faced by regulators and market participants alike.  But there appear to be significant institutional, regulatory and pricing barriers to their widespread use.  In addition, the new technologies are likely to present challenges of their own.
 
Accordingly, the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM-www.caem.org) is hosting a consensus-building forum designed to (a) achieve a common understanding of the grid-enhancing potential of the new technologies; (b) use an intensive role-reversal seminar to identify and highlight the institutional, regulatory and market design barriers to the successful deployment of the various new tools; and (c) develop technology-neutral recommendations addressing these barriers.
 
The project will begin in early 2002 with final policy recommendations to be published by Spring of 2002.  The project is expected to have a significant impact on decisions made by regulators, financial analysts, utility executives, the media and potential customers.
 
For a copy of the proposal, please e-mail Philip Marston, the Project Director, at pmarston@marstonlaw.com.  This forum is time-sensitive and the number of participants is limited.

DATE: September 25, 2001

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's "" Four RTO policy"" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 ""the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.""  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called ""NIMBA virus"".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to ""reliability standards.""  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

Jim,

Just to let you know, Ray and I spoke with Marc Racicot today about WestConnect and the problems associated with the filing made on Ocotber 15.

We emphasized the problems with overall lack of independence, lack of resolution on congestion management and market monitoring despite a four year process to do so.  We also touched on significant participating transmission operator involvement in the planning and interconnection process as well.

Mr. Racicot seemed very appreciative of our comments and noted that many of the governors he speaks with still do not have a full understanding of the implications of forming an RTO and will typically follow the path of least resistance.  Having been made aware of our concerns will help him better craft his message to this group.  He is interested in receiving any bullet points or summaries of any filing we make in regards to WestConnect.

Kind Regards,

Dave

I just talked with Kenneth Kohut and Bob Zarik of FERC (with Scott Miller's group).  They want to track Enron's EnronOnline pricing for these PHYSICAL products:

Gas
-Transco Zone 6 NY
-Henry Hub
-Chicago City Gate 
-Malin
-El Paso Non-bondad
-Permian Basin

Power
-Palo Verde 
-COB
-Mid C
-Cinergy
-PJM West

They would like us to tell them the best physical product to follow in gas (ie, gas daily, etc.) and want something that has Dec 01 pricing.  They also want EnronOnline end of day bid prices historically since August 01.  They then want to follow the pricing on EnronOnline themselves.

They already have access to most of this data through EnronOnline; however, the EnronOnline help desk told them that EnronOnline itself does not have historical data.  

I'll check with gas guys and see if we can get the data and report back to you.

"PECO ""No Objection"" Letter","Ed --

Can you please draft a letter (similar to what Paul Darmitzel sent to gas LDCs) to send to PECO Thursday to indicate that placing our physical load customers on bundled POLR service is not objectionable to EES?  

We have a bill due in PJM this Thursday that may not get paid.  If we don't pay PJM on Thursday, our brief analysis of the PA Supplier Tariff is that PECO can pull these customers back.  

The customers in PECO are GNO (e.g, Suiza), so not sure what the contract issues would be - maybe Michelle can help here.  My understanding is that the contracts should allow EES to serve using Utility power, so we should still have the right to determine to reject or not.

Please let me know if you can do this and if there are any issues.

Thanks,

Subject:	disruptive technology, short and simple and confidential


We produce political/public affairs television programs which air in state capitols. Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio, expanding into NJ, Md and DE. The disruptive technology is this: the real target of the TV show is the guest, not the audience. Lobbyists have trouble scheduling time with politicians and regulators, and when they get on the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from government decision makers. We don't have trouble with either. Every politician and appointee wants to be on television, they always say yes. When they ask us what the topics will be, and we mention something like telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on television. In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them.
 
In short:
 
Step one: identify gov't decision makers that our sponsors want to influence
Step two: invite them on the program and, in doing so, develop rapport with their key staff members on the relevant issues
Step three: send briefing materials and/or give a briefing in person before the the taping
Step four: towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely been bragging about his/her policy agenda
Step five: steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics, framing the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to resist the conclusions suggested by the host.
Step six: take the statement of support for the position we favor e.g. tort reform, privatization, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. (which by the way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air) and in addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show, we digitize it and send it out to legislators, regulators and the proper beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker to back off later.
 
Current sponsors: Medical Society, Hospital Association, State System of Higher Education, Manufacturers Association, Cornell Corrections, AT&T.
Levels: 25K, 50K, 100K per year for Pa; 15k for Ohio (one level only).
 
This is an amazingly simple, elegant and direct way to influence policy makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energy-oriented firms in partnership with us. Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit.
 
I'll be in touch,
 
p.s. Sponsorship can be done in ways that are not visible if you prefer, via intermediaries, if you are publicity shy.

Probably want to bring in Steve Montovano on the NC PUC question -- we have worked with a local lawyer in the past (I think her name is Allison Duncan) that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an RTO does NOT make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question.  Steve Montovano could probably be of assistance here.  Maybe bring in Allison to DC to deal directly with the staff?

Subject:	Hill Meetings on RTOs


I had two interesting meetings yesterday afternoon with staff to key members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee: Rep. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS).  Terry Allen, one of our consultants, accompanied me.

In both meetings, I used to great effect the broad coalition that had filed with us in the Southeast RTO case against the North Carolina PUC stay request.  If you didn't see it -- there is a long article on the coalition and the filing in yesterday's Energy Daily, which I used with the staff to show the many groups that support what we need in the Southeast.  I am going to send them the filing itself as a follow up.

Burr is very important because he is the lead cosponor of the Sawyer-Burr bill that has voluntary RTO language and effectively a prohibition on mandatory RTOs.  Key points--

	1,	We had heard from a friend of Carin's in the Burr office that Burr and/or the staff did not have favorable view of Enron.  I checked with the head of the Duke office -- a personal friend of mine -- who said the staffer has friends who work for Southern.  However, at the meeting, the staffer said that Burr's office had had difficulties with prior Enron lobbyists no longer with the company and that they looked forward to a fresh start.

	2.	Burr's main interest is transmission legislation that provides incentives for more investment so Wall Street will look favorably on transmission.  His main interest is in the incentive pricing section.  He said the bill was put in as they left so could stake out an opening position before Barton releases a draft in September.  (This confirms Pat's observation that Burr likes to be a player.)

	3.	Staff said Burr has done interviews in which he said that a handful of RTOs are inevitable and desirable -- the question is how to get there.  To date, he has been most influenced by the NC PUC -- (Commissioner Ervin, son or grandson of the late Senator, is a family friend of the Burr staffer).  The PUC says that the FERC RTO plans for the SE would force NC to act on retail competition before 2006 -- which it is not in a position to do.  (We need to respond to this argument.)

	4.	Burr staff acknowledged that the final subcommittee-approved bill (if there is one), would move far in the direction of the FERC plan.  He said that the draft to be sent out from committee staff next week will be a staff draft and that it may not even address the tough issues like RTOs -- leaving those decisions to Members.  (I will check with Andy Black -- who told me a few weeks ago that it would either affirm FERC's authority or make RTOs mandatory.)

	5.	Burr would be very interested in meeting with Ken Lay (per the request letter we had faxed earlier yesterday).

Pickering is important for the added reason that he is the primary House sponsor of PUHCA repeal.  His staff confirmed many of the details about process in the House that we had heard elsewhere.  The staff draft will be out next week -- may not cover all issues yet.  There will be 2-3 hearings in September.  That will be followed by a Barton draft that would be formally introduced (reflecting additions and changes from the staff draft.)

	1.	On PUHCA -- I raised our concerns about the recordkeeping provisions and gave him the clarifying language from V&E included in our draft package of language we gave DOE.  He said he has spoken to Kelliher (whose advice he respects) and that Joe said the recordkeeping language needed to be clarified.  Joe referred him to the version in H.R. 2944 in the last Congress (which I will check to see if that solves our problem.)  Staffer is willing to look at our language.

	2.	On RTOs -- Pickering's office has not too much.  The staffer is under the impression that Entergy might actually like them in the way FERC has proposed.  He said Southern has raised concerns about FERC's plans with Pickering's office, but the staffer gets the impression that Southern thinks they are inevitable -- it is all a matter of timing.  The disturbing thing is the staffer said something about perhaps staging the RTO process so there would be more of them of smaller scope now on a pre-set path to 4-5 later.  I said this was a bad idea -- wasted resources to form the interm steps and likely that the final 4-5 would then never happen.  Instead, Congress needs to follow FERC's lead that 4-5 make sense based on natural trading markets, power flows, etc.

I was encouraged by these meetings in terms of not encountering stiff resistance -- but coming away knowing we need to fully implement our aggressive campaign plans to keep the legislative process from becoming a hindrance to achieving our RTO goals.

Leslie,

I have just completed reviewing the APS filing.  This paper explains much of the observed behavior of APS during the DSTAR (WestConnect) proceedings over the last several months.

The paper is so full of market ""scare"" tactics it seems appropriate to be reading it during the Halloween season.  The token effort of procuring 270MWs starting 2003 and ramping up to 1670 MWs in 2008 is ridiculous.  The statements that APS generation is somehow more secure and reliable than any generation not owned by APS, using the same grid, and that non-APS generators have little if any responsibility to the ""Full-Requirements"" customers are all beyond belief.  

The mis-characterization of the problems experienced in CA, OR and WA and the contemptuous citing of ""experts"" seems typical of the APS distain for deregulation.

The entire filing is more like a guaranteed plan to recover the ""Billion"" dollars invested by APS, with convenient adjustment clauses every three years.

As you noted earlier today, the Commissioner of the ACC may be more concerned over the APS stock price than truly encouraging open markets and retail access and what better why to help the stock price than to award APS a 14 year contract...look at what the Defense Department did for Lockheed!!!

I spoke with Chris Lackey who met earlier this month with Pinnacle West's (APS subsidiary) head of Trading who told him that PinWest is very conservative (as stated in the filing), their primary function is to support APS and they saw no real opportunities to conduct business with Enron.  However that could change if their petition is denied.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.  If this is approved by the ACC I assume it must then go to FERC, do we have an opportunity to intervene with the ACC and/or FERC in regards to this filing?  If we do, I'll be happy to help you with composition of the documents.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Rogers --

Harry Kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit ConEd to discuss the Benchmark Rate Swap.  I think it's a great idea (Scott Gahn and I had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran URM).  

My only thoughts for you would be: 1) maybe difficult to do the swap with the Utility (given PUC oversight), but the Holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from PUC scrutiny and 2) being long T&D (assuming that you don't sell 100% of the position to customers) creates interesting regulatory questions.

I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product.

And the winner is .............. ""me"" to coordinate.  I have been leading with Legal and Trading.  Legal confirmed their right under the gas tariff (due to our downgrade).   Don's team, myself and the credit contact at NIMO reviewed the exposure calculation and believe it to be accurate at first review.  I am inquiring to a lock box to reduce the requirement by 50%.  Deadline to deliver is next Thursday, Nov 29th.

Harry/Gloria - could you please review their requirement?  NIMO is asking for collateral in effect to cover EES base load for the Supplier Select program, assuming EES does not deliver for 30 days and assuming the coldest day (in the past 30 years) which in effect mutiplies our load by a factor of 3.  However, NIMO has agreed to use forward Jan price in lieu of the past 12 months as stipulated in their tariff.

Subject:	Re: California - Credit Worthiness requirements

Amr,
The situation with the California ISO is complicated by the fact that they recently had to face a loss of creditworthiness from PG&E and Southern California Edison. In an ammendment to the the ISO Tariff, the ISO proposed revisions to the tariff that would in effect waive the sanctions ot the ISO Tariff's creditworhiness requeriments for certain entities that were creditworthy as of January 3, 2001 but were about to lose the Approved Credit Rating that established their creditworthiness. This only applies to purchases using their own generation and transmission, but opened a pandora box in the evaluation of creditworthiness for market participants in California. In addition, the ISO Tariff did not have procedures in place to admit guarantees from third parties to back energy, ancillary services and grid management charges. A process was incorporated to this effect recently to allow SCE and PG&E buy power backed by California Department of Water Resources.
In any event, each Scheduling Coordinator (SC), Utility Distribution Company (UDC) or Metered Subsystem (MSS) must maintain an approved Credit Rating or provide in favor of the ISO one fo the following forms of security for an amount to be determined by the SC, UDC or MSS in the form stated in the Tariff:
An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit confirmed by a bank or financial institution reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional surety bond posted by an insurance company reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional guarantee which has and maintains an Approved Credit Rating;
A cash deposit standing to the credit fo an interested bearing escrow accoint maintained at a bank or financial institution designated by the ISO;
A certificate of deposit in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO; or
A payment bond certificate in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO;
Letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, payment bond certificates, escrow agreements and certificates of deposit shall be in such form as the ISO may reasonably require from time to time by notice to SC, UDCs or MSSs. SCs, UDCs or MSSs that do not maintain an approved credit rating will not be allowed to submit a schedule to the ISO, and the ISO will reject any schedule submitted if the security amount is not deposited. If an outstanding liability exceeds 90% of the required security amount, a notification by the ISO will be issued to cover the security within 15 days.
As of March 13, 2000, an approved credit rating with respect to market obligations, is defined as an entity maintaining at lest an A2/P2 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating or a A3/A- (or equivalent) long-term credit rating from a national credit rating agency. Market obligations are Imbalance energy, Ancillary Services, Grid Operations Charge, Wheeling Access Charge, High Voltage Access Charge, Transition Charge, Usage Charges and FERC Annual Charges. I suppose day-ahead energy charges are also included since the dissolution of the PX, although I could not find an explicit reference to this issue in the regulations.
SCs, UDCs or MSSs  must maintain A1/P1 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating for the Grid Management charges, or the charges the ISO makes to fund its operations.
If you have any questions, please let me know. Regards,
ALF

Please see first article. 

Sue and Janine - I think we need to talk about this apart from the RTO effort and as part of rebuilding momentum for restructuring.  If Arkansas repeals we could face an even more uphill battle in states like Missouri, Lousianna and other states.  The Governor has stated that repeal is ' ""a real possibility"" unles it's demonstrated that Ark. will see benefits.""  From the joint mw/ne staff meeting last week I understand that no decision had yet been made on whether or not Enron would intervene.  The next hearing at the commission is next Thursday the 18th.

Gentelmen, Yesterday's Power Daily reported on filings make in Arkansas regarding delaying restructuring. In preparation for any upcoming meeting with the Commission, we should at least familiarize ourselves w/ various stakeholders and commissioners takes on restructuring.

Following is a brief description of the article:

Entergy Arkansas  - state should take wait and see approach and decide later if it should pusch back the current '05 deadline

AG Pryor - push back beyond '05 - referenced Southwesterns and Entergy's difficulties in being ready for Texas '02 - states law should not be repealed but strengthened w/ consumer protections

SWEPCO (AEP) - starting choice in Oct. '03 might still be possible -- opposes any changes to current law

OK G&E - favors delaying beyond '05

Ark. Elec Coop - favors repeal

Your model now assumes a modification to the Distribution tariff to include a new rate element.  That may get around the Settlement (although OCA in PA will think that now D is going up and there is no offset in the G rate so consumers are getting screwed because they won't switch).  

Also, can the PaPUC implement this charge and direct the EDCs to transfer the funds to third-party generators?  Seems like that would require legislative changes.  

I like the idea that there should be fixed charge for ICAP - one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony - remember if they are earning more from the market than that $ amount, they are overearning on their stranded costs.

Subject:	RE: Enron ICAP Strawman

In response to the issues:

1.  I would propose that the ""Reliability Tax"" modeled after the Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax (GRFT) and would be an additional line item on a utility's bill.  In this way it is not an increase in either T or D and perhaps the waiver would not be required.  (See related comment to issue 4 below).

2.  The proposal contemplates that the generators get the revenue (this is their ""buy-in"" to the proposal).  Taking PJM as the model, they currently produce three load forecasts at varying temperatures - one at a ""high"" temperature, one at a ""low"" temperature, and one at a designated temperature.  The  proposal would set the obligation at the ""high"" temperature forecast and the cost-recovery of the ICAP at the ""low"" temperature forecast (maximizes the MWH charge).  Any over-recovery would be used to pay for system improvements.  Any under-recovery would be used in setting the recovery charge for the following year.  [Conceptually this how it is intended to work.  However, this needs to be thought through in a more detailed level]

3.  Off hand I don't know what the current ICAP revenues are but I could find out.  As for the proposal, the tax would be determined by the results of the ICAP auction, e.g, PJM would go out for 60,000 MW of ICAP, review the bids, and set the clearing price.  The total ""cost"" of ICAP (60,000 MW x $X/MW) would be used to set the Tax (MWH charge, using the ""low"" temperature forecast).

4.  As a separate line item on the utility's bill and presented as a tax, the state regulators would have as much of a role in this tax as they have (or had) in the GRFT.  I see their biggest issue at this early stage of the strawman is what share of over-recovery do the ratepayers receive.  The argument that the over-recovery go to system improvements and not to the ratepayers is the efficiency improvement in the system.

Good start. 

A couple of issues -

1.	Raising transmission rates for the PA utilities would effectively reduce their Distribution revenues (the Settlements stipulated that if T went up, then D had to come down).  Maybe we could get everyone to agree to a one-time waiver of this and have end-user's bills go up. 

2.	Where does the $ from the Reliability Tax go?  Toward what purpose?  If generators are not compensated in some manner (maybe a passthrough directly), won't they strongly oppose this model?  We need to propose some reasonable uses of these funds (better metering to enable load curtailment to smaller customers OR maybe pay for an RMR type arrangement).

3.	What is the current amount of ICAP market revenues today?  What would you recommend as a total tax?

4.	The Reliability Tax would be FERC jurisdicitional as constructed?  How are the PUCs going to view this?  Will they have a role i setting the $ and the use?

Subject:	Enron ICAP Strawman

In an email I sent yesterday, I touched on an ICAP proposal I've been thinking about and thought I would expand on it more.
The political reality of ICAP is that it is here to stay; at least as long as there are energy price caps or retail rate caps.  ICAP is also a most likely outcome by regulators and politico's if energy prices are perceived to be too high (assuming no price caps).  Therefore, we need to come up with a system that is fair and doesn't prejudice any one participant, especially if the participant is us.  The system I have been kicking around is one in which we would concede any trading opportunity in ICAP but would relieve our load servers with the obligation.

The ISO's (particularly PJM) and others have been stating that ICAP is required for reliability reasons.  While we can argue against this concept and try to convince these folks that operating reserves with a well-run energy market is sufficient for reliability, I don't think we are going to win (it's a battle of perception and, unfortunately, one man's perception is another man's reality).  For this reason ICAP should be the sole purview of the RTO.  The RTO is the one who has all the information on load forecasts and installed resources and is the one who performs the necessary analysis to determine reserve margins and obligations.  In PJM, the staff  would perform all calculations and present the results to the Reliability Committee for approval which would typically be approved unanimously.  

I would propose that the RTO determine the annual ICAP obligation, and then conduct an annual auction for the necessary resources.  I know that Enron does not want the RTO involved in the market, but this would be no different than what the RTO does in a daily LMP market - he receives bids, stacks them, determines the clearing price, and dispatches according to the stack.  It would be the same for the ICAP auction.  The RTO would not be a participant in the market as such and is only the facilitator.  The total cost of ICAP  would then be allocated to the transmission owners based on a pro-rata share of their installed load and recovered from load as a part of their revenue requirements (ideally it would appear as a separate line item on an end users bill and be identified as a ""reliability tax"" so they would see what it is costing them).

This proposal, while not perfect would accomplish the following:
1.  It would satisfy the reliability concerns of the RTO's and politicians,
2.  It would assess a ""tax"" on the load for reliability since load is the beneficiary (assuming there is a benefit from ICAP) of reliability,
3.  It would relieve the LSEs of the burden and obligation of providing ICAP,
4.  Deficiency penalties would not be required and accompanying deficiency rates would not need to be determined,
5.  Generators would still receive ICAP income, provided they are selected in the auction,
6.  Since the ICAP obligation is typically for a period in the future (in PJM, the ICAP requirements approved this year are for the year 2003), the much talked about ""price signal""  for new generation is provided.
7.  It allows the market to set the ICAP and not some artificial deficiency rate,
8.  Market power issues associated with the existing ICAP markets are eliminated.

I kept the distribution of this proposal to a limited number to get a feel for this type of proposal.  If you are in general agreement with the concept, I can formalize it and send it to a larger distribution including the commercial folks.  I would, of course, be interested in any comments or feedback you may have and would incorporate those into the document to be distributed to the larger group.  I think a concept of this could be sold to other participants and, after we are satisfied with it, I would solicit it to others outside of Enron to get their support.

I have a document by someone named Marty Howard, who I believe may be
associated with Portland General. The document was sent to me by Richard
Tabors. According to the email Howard used to work for McCullough.

After a very brief read through, I think it tries to show that the
statistical link between prices in CA and the PNW was WEAK in peak hours. I
suppose they are trying to show that the ""contagion"" effect from California
show not be an issue? I have some problems from an initial read with the
econometric analysis, but I have not yet reviewed it fully.

However, it also leaves open the very possibility that was discussed earlier
on the call. If there is a refund, and it is based on some notion of ""PNW
prices"", it could be a very large one. I think we need to consider this
issue quite carefully.

Wes,
 
FYI.  

Jeff Dasovich met with SCE to discuss settlement of  Enron's PX claims.  Nothing was agreed to, but I wanted to make certain you were aware of this meeting.  It is interesting that all of SCE's comments dealt with their under collection and the DWR costs.  I have not continued to monitor current tariff assumptions.  However, I do not believe estimates for the resolution of these issues are currently included.   As I understand things, it remains anybody's guess as to what will be required of direct access customers, much less how much of the under collection SCE will be allowed to recover.  Regulatory Affairs is working closely with the desk to completely understand the impact of future regulatory decisions and work to obtain the best result for Enron.  

I will make sure you and Mary Lynne stay informed re these discussions.   If you would like to discuss, just call.

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy

RE: Reliability Legislation - New Drafts

A number of proposed bills addressing the reliability issue have recently been circulated.  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) recently distributed a draft electricity title to a comprehensive energy bill.  The reliability section of the draft is attached.  The House Energy Subcommittee chaired by Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) has also circulated language which is attached.  Additionally in response to concerns expressed during a recent EEI CEO meeting, EEI has circulated their own legislative proposal, absent participation from NERC and its consensus group.  Their draft is based on the NERC bill, but contains several significant changes as noted below. This is also attached for your review.  

Senator Bingaman's language encompasses only two pages.  The legislation simply grants to FERC authority to develop and enforce standards.  FERC may choose to adopt any NERC proposed standard.  Lastly, FERC can delegate enforcement of standards to NERC or an RTO if it chooses to do so.  

The House four page draft version of reliability language proposes to do the following: 

- Establish an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO), subject to FERC 
  approval; no Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (ARREs); it is unclear 
  whether FERC could approve multiple EROs.

- ERO files proposed standards or modifications with FERC, which can 
  approve or remand for further consideration.
- ERO would enforce standards and impose penalties, subject to FERC 
  review.  FERC can assign authority for a given region to an RTO.  Also, 
  FERC on its own can order compliance and penalties.  

- ERO to take ""appropriate steps"" to coordinate with Canada and Mexico; 
  President to use ""best efforts"" to reach international agreements.

The EEI proposal includes the following points:

- FERC would establish and maintain jurisdiction over EROs and an 
  appropriate number of ARREs.  FERC can choose to direct the ERO to 
  develop or modify standards.  

- EROs develop standards subject to FERC approval.

- ERO, under FERC direction, will delegate authority to regional entities.  
  This presumably can include ARREs or RTOs.  ERO and appropriate 
  entities would enforce standards.  FERC can also enforce and impose 
  penalties.  

This past Tuesday, EPSA staff meet with Bobby Lamb and Craig Glazer, representatives from PJM, to discuss PJM's legislative proposal.  It was clear from the meeting that there is flexibility to make changes, which could address our areas of concern in order to gain our support.  For example, they told us that some parts of the proposed bill were written to gain support from groups who then favored the NERC bill.   With the recent circulation of other versions of reliability language, they invited us to suggest changes to their reliability language.  The meeting revealed that EPSA's and PJM's views are very similar, and that a potential opportunity exists to develop a better alternative to the NERC Bill.

We are holding a conference call on Thursday, September 20, 2001, at 4:00 P.M. (EDT) to discuss these opportunities and possible new legislative initiatives.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Mark Bennett/EPSA Call.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact Mark Bennett or Donn Salvosa at 202-628-8200.

Subject:	RE: CA question

Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

Leslie, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Congratulations, you have received an A. 
A great last week with your usual high level of enthusiasm and professional work outputs. Your paper was very compelling too - the graphic really helped to get the point across. What made this paper even better was the way you integrated it into your work life at Enron. 
The group presentation was outstanding - it was nicely laid out with good balance and structure and covered all the relevant points. It showed a high level of design and thought and it provided a concise view of the teams strengths and weaknesses and how the combinations of them helped it to be effective. It was a professional product and by far one of the best presentations I have seen on this subject. 
Best of luck in all of your future endeavors and I wish you continued success in all of your professional aspirations.

Subject:	Enron v. FERC appeal at DC federal court (Entergy source and sink)

The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).

It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts?

Do you know if anyone is going to this?  Should we work with EPSA to publish an EPSA piece that corresponds to this?

At least some others (Electricities) is planning to oppose, so it will not go unopposed if Enron doesn't join in.

Subject: Answering North Carolina Utils Comm'n Motion for Stay


As you may know, while several state Commissions have sought rehearing of
FERC's July 12 orders initiating the RT-100 mediation, the NCUC accompanied
its rehearing application with an August 13 motion to stay that Order.
ElectriCities, via Jim Horwood of our firm, is planning to file on August 28
in opposition to that motion, on the grounds that a single RTO for the
Southeast is well worth attempting to achieve through mediation and that the
GridSouth record belies the NCUC's claims of surprise.  A multiparty
opposition by multiple transmission customers and others would be helpful in
keeping RTO unification on track.  Accordingly, we invite you all to
consider joining in our opposition (draft to be circulated in advance of the
August 28 due date but not yet written) or filing an opposition of your own.
If you're sufficiently interested in joining such a motion to want an
advance draft for confidential review, please let me know who should get it,
along with any special considerations on timing.

Subject:	Xcel


Donna/Sarah--I got together with Audrey Zibelman from Xcel on Friday afternoon to catch up and she wanted to talk about the petition that Xcel and the other midwest utilities had filed on transferring their assets into a for profit transco, Translink.  In my discussions with Audrey, she expressed a hope that Enron would be able to support the filing and that she'd like to open a dialogue on how to get our support.  I indicated that there were at least 2 issues that would be of concern for us---support for one RTO and support for one tariff within that RTO.  Although she was open and probably even supportive of one RTO in the midwest, there is a separate tariff for any delivery within the Translink system within her proposal.  SHe described that tariff as being different than the Detroit Edison case that you guys filed against.  I confirmed that the publics who are in the transco (NPPD, OPPD, Cornbelt) would not agree to be in the transco without the separate tariff.

I have sent via overnight a copy of materials on the transco to both of you.  I told her that Donna was that lead on the Midwest team, and that you'd be willing to talk/meet with her.  If practical, it would be good if you could call her in the next few days for a number of reasons---1.) I am sure that Xcel is planning a similiar transco for the west and if you can get a better sense of whether we are on any of the same pages, it would be good to have that input for our western discussion on Wednesday in Houston  2.) she is one of the panelists for RTO week, so you might be able to set up a time in D.C. that you could meet in person  3.) you might be able to get a sense of what she will be talking about at RTO week on her panel.

Dear James,
I noticed your involvement in the Center for the Advancement of Energy
Markets and I would like to invite you to join the Council of Energy
Advisors, an association of petroleum engineers, electrical engineers,
petroleum geologists, consultants, power traders, and energy professionals
whom we pay their hourly rate to fill out brief online surveys and/or
consult part-time by telephone on issues of power and energy products and
services for investment managers.  I think that your knowledge of the power
and energy industry would be a valuable addition to the Council.  Membership
in the Council is free; you can register online at
http://www.thecouncils.com/peapp.asp (a quick 5-minute form).
We pay Advisors variable rates for surveys depending on the time commitment
and their customary consulting rates for telephone consultations. You may
decline any survey or consultation that is not in your area of interest or
should you not have the time; you are therefore not making any time
commitment by joining.  Also, Advisors are never asked to answer questions
about their own employers; we don't create any appearance of a potential
conflict of interest.

The Council of Energy Advisors includes members from leading universities,
organizations, and firms such as SPE, EPRI, ABB, TVA, MIT, Square D,
Calpine, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Enron, Mirant, Exxon, Shell. BP and
Chevron. The Council has more than 400 engineers, petroleum professionals,
technology solution end users, independent consultants and researchers
working at utilities and solution design consultancies, leaders on IEEE
standards bodies and thought leaders in the industry.  Our clients include
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Salomon Smith Barney, Fidelity Fund Management,
JP Morgan and about ninety other leading investment firms on both coasts.

Our web site at www.thecouncils.com gives more information about our work.
Please take some time to consider the Council, look over our website, and
let me know what you think.  I look forward to working with you.

Best regards,
Matt

It makes sense for Gloria and Rebecca to get together (I am available to talk tomorrow and have asked Gloria to set something up).  

Also, we need to work together to make sure that EES' reports, taxes, and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion (with the right internal groups).

On the IL Bond issue, there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC.  The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current.  Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow?

Evan,

Attached is a matrix that identifies our current State Licenses.  We work directly with EES Legal for license renewals and new registrations.  As Craig has indicated below, our records indicate we are current for both Licensing and Bond Requirements in Illinois at a State Level.

As EES is currently pursuing Supplier Billing Option (SBO) behind Commonwealth Edison, we will have to comply with the credit worthiness requirements outlined by Gloria, but my understanding of her email indicates we currently meet these standards and will only be required to supply funds in the event our credit rating drops further.

Evan,

As you know, the license application function was migrated to the Service Desk in August 2001.  This activity was previously maintained by Beth Gooden.  In any case, our records show that EES is current and compliant.  EES was granted a retail license in August 1999.  To maintain the license, EES must submit an annual ""Re-certification"" and keep a bond current.  A Re-certification application was submitted on 1/31/01 and the  bond was extended through 6/1/02.

I hope this answers your concerns.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.

"Govt Affairs Org Chart","Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	IURC - MISO SETTLEMENT

I reviewed the settlement document last night and quite frankly do not see a whole lot of reason to sign on at this point as it is a rehash simply of things MISO is already required to do.  Moreover, the settlement would not limit MISO in any future amendment to the MISO agreement, leaving them free to do as they please, post settlement.  The language in parts is a little troublesome, things like, MISO ""has an impressive infrastructure"";  that transmission owners and marketers ""will need to learn through experience"" thus providing them an out for unacceptable behavior; acknowledgements that ""it is important not to delay progress indefinately in the hope of making transmission system operations perfect in the Midwest for Day One,"" which while we may conceptually agree with, I'd never want in writing in this context because it gives them an excuse not to adopt anything we may propose in the name of expediency; etc. Etc.  The settlement also acknowledges the reasonableness of the MISO Administrative Cost Adder but allows us to challenge it in a proceeding.  This shifts the burden of proof by creating a rebuttal presumption of reasonableness which will be more difficult to litigate.

I have calls into a number of intervenors to get their take on this and will keep you apprised.

Christi/Sarah--you guys are probably aware of this, but just in case you aren't, there was an article in the Minneapolis paper yesterday that Xcel (NSP) had filed on Friday with FERC to transfer it's transmission system to a new company called TransLink Transmission Co.  Joining them are Alliant, Corn Belt Coop (Iowa), Mid AMerican, NPPD, and OPPD.  

I noted that there was a quote in the article that ""Xcel estimates that it would cut its overal transmission related fees by more than a thrid through it's participation in Translink.......because there will be less overlap of functions.""

RE: Regulatory Affairs Panel Follow-Up & Future Meeting
       ?Thursday, September 13th

Attached you will find the presentations from EPSA's July 25th Regulatory Affairs meeting that focused on FERC's use of the hub-and-spoke method to evaluate market-based rate authority.  The speakers included John Hughes of ELCON, Diana Moss of FERC, Craig Roach of Boston Pacific Company and Don Santa of Troutman Sanders.  Also attached is EPSA's handout from the meeting outlining the hub-and-spoke method and its criticisms.

The meeting launched EPSA's effort to coordinate members' thinking on the hub-and-spoke issue and, by extension, the debate surrounding the definition of market power.  While EPSA has not expressly endorsed one particular method to determine market-based rates, we have written on the broader issue of market monitoring and market power assessment in various RTO dockets, and most recently in our Market Monitoring: A White Paper, which was filed in both California and New York
dockets.

Whether or not the hub-and-spoke method is the correct and most efficient model to determine market-based rate authority, an even larger issue also enters the debate -the definition of market power.  The issues are ripe for debate: we've seen it on the regulatory front, with FERC Commissioners calling to reassess the hub-and-spoke method, and on the political front, with politicians making allegations of market power abuse.

FERC's Order No. 2000 does allow market monitoring proposals to vary with RTO structure; however, one fundamentally important detail was left undecided in the rule - the definition of market power and abuse thereof.  Similarly, in the traditional definition of market power, ""the ability to profitably sustain prices above competitive levels, acting alone or together with other firms,"" the definition of the word sustain remains subjective and unclear.  Therefore, as EPSA moves forward, we must be sure to endorse clear and consistent standards to identify and remedy anti-competitive behavior.

Next Steps:

EPSA would like to host a one-day roundtable discussion on the issue of market-based rate methods and EPSA's forward-looking position on the subject.  We are planning for Thursday, September 13th, here in Washington, DC.  The meeting will piggyback our Annual Board Planning meeting that will be held the following day.  We would like to gauge members' interest in attending the meeting and need to get a preliminary headcount so as to secure an appropriate venue.  If you are interested in attending the September 13th meeting, please RSVP to Jackie Gallagher at jgallagher@epsa.org or 202-628-8200 by Friday, August 10th.  An announcement with the exact time and location will be forwarded in the near future.  If you have any questions, please contact Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org.

Below is a draft that reflects the subjects discussed and where I think we ought to land, based on our meeting earlier this week.  I would like to file these soon, so please get back to me.

In the meeting there was a lot of discussion on the RFP process.  Of course the utilities wanted to be able to draft the RFP, choose the winning bidder, have their affiliates participate in the process and have very scanty PUCO oversight, all of which I fought vigourously.  I was asked however if Enron could provide info on what should and should not be in an RFP.  On the should part, I said we could probably provide some insights, but that the should not category would probably be a ""I know it when I see it"" call.  Having said that, any input on this question would be appreciated.

Subject: Sue's Retort to SCE's Premise
Importance: High


I don't agree Edison's premise -- that ""direct access customers contributed just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service customers."" We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to buy power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I will explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeoffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their billions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in direct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs alone -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject to any presumed ""undercollection.""

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the retail busness from T&D. So, they did a ""top-down"" calculation.  This meant that there had to be a ""credit"" put on the bills of DA customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA. So, the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the rates.  Next, although bundled customers rates were capped, the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed their tariffs with the CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got nowhere, until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our argument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have thought we had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high. So, we have a legal right to receive the full PX Credit/Negative CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated with bundled customers. It seems as if we should be able to prosecute this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an attorney) 

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

Sue

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.  Retail guys periodically ask about AZ but there is little to tell them.  If we see a worthy cause, let's go for it.

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.

Subject:	National Governors Association


Reporting from Providence Rhode Island......although the plenary sessions of the NGA summer meeting have not focused on energy issues, DOE secretary Spence Abraham did make a short presentation to the Natural Resorces Committee this morning.  He used only one visual, and it was pretty effective---very simple/one page.  The message was 175 Quadrillion BTU's will be the nation's energy needs by 2020, 48 could be met by conservation, 98 is today's supply (domestic and imported) which leaves 29 quads as the shortfall.  The last line showed that between 1991-2000, domestic supply had only increased by 1 quad. He was very well received by the governors (committee members attending were Vilsack-IA, Keating-OK,Geringer-Wy, Minner-DE, Johnson-NM, Hoeven-ND, McCallum-WI)

Governor Davis showed up for the end of Abraham's comments and did his normal personal pat on the back for how well his state has done in conservation and how they had many power plants on line.  He made a slightly disparaging comment about Wyoming/Cheney needing to get on the bandwagon for conservation, at which point Geringer got a bit testy and cautioned Davis to be ""careful"" about whether he wanted to get into that debate.

Most of the questions by the Governors to Abraham focused on transmission.  Abraham inidicated that federal eminent domain was intended as a last resort if the states can't get it done and that he is sensitive to the governors wanting local control.  Several Governors expressed their hope that they could get transmission issues solved on their own, and that if they did not, they were open to further ""discussion"" of having FERC help them.

After the meeting, Gov. Vilsack (chairman of the committee) and Gov. Keating (vice chair) held a press conference, along with next year's committee chairs,  Hoeven/ND and Minner/DE.  They presented the NGA comprehensive energy policy resolution--NR-18 (I had forwarded it on to most people on this list last week) and talked about how much there was that both dems and republicans had agreed on in the document.  The reporters asked several questions on the eminent domain....both Vilsack and Keating again stated that they wanted to see if states could get the job done and if not, they were open to further discussions with the feds.

I'll be here thru tomorrow.  Page me or leave me a voice mail if you want to discuss in more detail.

Let me cogitate on this.  The local counsel we use on electric matters is more of a gas attorney than an electric one, and the counsel we use for the SW Gas matters is also APS's counsel so he can't help us on these matters.  The customers are no allies, since they are happy with their deal, and the only other marketer who was active in the settlement is gone now (the internet marketer from California).  Perhaps we could talk to APS to see what they are thinking.  That might be more enlightening than anything else.  Just a thought.

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

I have received 2 calls in the last two days from EES and ENA (Lance Hinricks and David Porter) wanting to know the details of AZ electric marketing.  They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.

It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.

That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.  

SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds.

  How are you and Marianna and Grace doing?  Well, I hope!  I don't know if Jason has mentioned to you that Roger and I have been living in Birmingham, Alabama - no, not in a trailer.  Roger moved here with work last November, and I finally caught up with him early this summer.   
   In the meanwhile, he has left the company he was working for, and we are looking at moving back to Houston.  Roger has spent the last six years in the recyclable steel (steel scrap) trading business as a trader.  We have noticed that Enron is involved in steel trading, as well as coal trading - two areas in which Roger would be very interested pursuing possible opportunities.  I was wondering if you would be able to provide us with a couple of potential contact names of people who work directly over those areas.  I hope I am not putting you on the spot.  We just believe that it would be much more fruitful to be able to make contact in that manner.  If you are not comfortable doing that, I would certainly understand. 
    In any event, please drop me a line and let me know how you are doing!  It has been a while.  Was the sailing trip with Jason and Shea the last time I saw you?  That was pretty fun!  I hope Jason hasn't sold the boat.  If we ever do get back to Houston, I would love to do that again.  I haven't talked to Jason since July - when we were able to go to lunch.  I'm hoping he and Shea are still making a go of it.  They would make a great pair!  Anyway, I hope to hear from you soon!  Thanks!   Lisa

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Subject:	Recruiting Kick-off Meeting 

Hello Jim,

Our Department is planning a Recruiting Offsite.  With this offsite we would like to include our Executive Team Leads.  

Had a couple of questions to ask:

1)  Would you be available for our recruiting kick-off meeting on September 5, from 2-5?
2)  Would you be willing to come to Jillians or would they rather stay close to the building, there is a reception that would follow.

If you are available please save the date.

Please let me know.  

Paul L./Recruiter

"ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE - Data Submission in FERC Pacific Northwest Refund Case","Richard --

We need to make some decisions very soon (this morning) about Enron's submission of data into the Pacific Northwest (""PNW"") refund case.  The data is due at FERC no later than Thursday August 16.

The key strategic issues in submitting the data to the ALJ include the following --

1.	Do we exclude bookouts (ie, only physical transactions)?

It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts.  EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case.

2.	Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases?

The ALJ's Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence, our purchase would not be included in the data.  The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload.  Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence, we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases.  By having the data in the case, we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds.  This is key for Enron in that our primary defense is that Enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount.

3.	Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks (through 24 hours, through 7 days, through one month, through 1 year)?

The ALJ's Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of ""spot"" - deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of.  Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC's Order.  The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply.  In addition, it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and ""determine"" our trading strategies.  Weighing these risks, I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance.

4.	Do we provide data based on contract date? 

The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25, 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.  This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows. To minimize the hours on these transactions, we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions.

I will call you this morning.  

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	SWG

ACC approved SWG rate order today with following relevant amendments:

   1.  SWG directed to file new imbalance language within 30 days adopting ""most expensive slice of gas"" methodology proposed by Enron/Midwest

   2. Staff to review filing for compliance with order - has up to 120 days for this, but SWG was warned from bench not to apply current imbalance calculation during that interim period.

   3.  Finding in Recommended Order upholding SWG's current interpretation of imbalance provisions deleted - Enron instructed from bench that it should file a separate complaint for the 2000-2001 winter period which ACC would consider ""without preconceptions""

   4.  Language about considering new types of transportation programs in the PGA workshops retained.

On the surface, I consider this at least a partial win.  However, Staff was particularly upset about these amendments and vowed off the record to use the 120 period to try to get the Commission to reverse its position on reducing imbalance charges.  I told Andy Bettwy that if SWG and Staff did not play games with this 30 day filing and acted in good faith during the workshops, we would be willing to discuss the issue of last winter prior to filing anything with the Commission.  He was non-committal.

			Jeff:

			As you may know, at Jim's request, Stacey Bolton reviewed the renewables language in SBX2 79 and SB 532 and identified some important issues. 

			In a memo she sent out yesterday, she detailed her concerns about these bills (copied below, for your reference).  

			How do you suggest we proceed?  Shall I arrange a brief call for us with Stacey, Elliot, Mary and Jesse to discuss where we stand and strategy going forward?

			Jennifer  

			***************
			Overall Concerns:  
				1.	The requirement for retailers to enter into a direct bilateral for the power from renewable energy and schedule it into the CA grid presents limitations and could drive up costs.
				2.	It?s unclear if the REC is truly separate instrument from the underlying commodity.  The above requirement indicates that it is not.  This would negatively impact, and even negate the main reasons to have a REC trading program - to provide flexibility and act as verification for the RPS.
				3.	The biomass definition is too limiting.  Would be difficult to detail this amount of information on a REC.  Need to have language that distinguishes whether the REC is RPS eligible or not.
				4.	Utilities are given preferential treatment in proposed language in that utilities can recover costs through rate base and the Department of Water Resources (SB 532 only) is instructed to purchase renewables on their behalf if it is cost prohibitive for the utilities.
				5.	While the cost cap is positive from a retail perspective, it might be out of the market from a wholesale perspective to cover the renewable premiums for new sources.

					Thanks.  The changes in combination are okay, though it would be better to get the date as Sept '96 for eligibility and interconnected to CA grid.  Also, we still need to work on the REC language (i.e. not mandatorily tied to output power contracts).  What's the best way to approach?  Discuss w/ Jeff Dasovich?

					Also, I wanted to make sure that you have on your radar screen the most recent versions of the bills you analyzed.   I noticed, for example, that in the most recent version of SB 532 (amended on 8/27) there were some important revisions (for example, see highlighted text).

					Subject:	SBX2 78 - Update

					The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on
					amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed,
					some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee
					members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by
					TURN and other consumer groups.

					During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and
					Richard Katz from the Governor?s office regarding a couple of issues
					highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more
					technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently,
					Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff?s request.  D.J. agreed that the bill
					needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA
					contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard about
					it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying
					amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to
					believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too
					self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct
					access.  We suggested that ?shall? be changed to ?may? in order to give more
					leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn?t necessarily oppose
					the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can
					totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do).

					A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to
					push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this
					bill passes.

					There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor?s
					desk.

					The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote on
					additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill.

Someone has to have documented information on who has been DASRed by EES to this point.  We don't need meetings to make sure we are straight on this.  Whoever we are showing through internal sources, CSC, or the ISO as being physically deliverd to by EES or any subsidiary of Enron Corp, we need to De DASR them.

We have already given ERCOT the authority to cancel the pending request for Owens, however, we need to send the DeDASR over as well.  

Additionally, ERCOT is going to hold a conference call with EES, TXU and ERCOT to walk through the steps for the drop to POLR (TDSP).  I am going to send Bob Gresch's contact info to them for the call.  If anyone else would like to be included on this call, please let me know.  Thanks.

Jim,

Ray and I talked.   DETM's proposal is reasonably clear:  a new cap would be set  whenever the proxy index exceeds 110% (or goest below 90%) of the current cap.  At that time, it is reset.  This is about as good as you can get with a gas proxy, and the traders can live with it

Ray and I recommend that we not explain this in our pleading since it dilutes our message: make it the ""hightest of"" the 3 proxies.

In terms of no refund if below the cap:  Ray may add something but everyone seems to be in a agreement that transactions below the cap are final.  Even TFG did not raise that issue in its comments.

In our discussion of the Duke model, we don't outline when the cap would be set?  Would the Duke model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we don't exceed.  Maybe make this point stronger.

Jim,

Review of the past due process flow chart shows substantial compliance with the rules, except that the final notice (termination notice) in the 2nd chart must specify a termination date that is not less than 10 days from date notice was issued. Thus the next action cannot commence earlier than the 23rd day per this time line. However, under the rules EES can issue the termination notice any time after the 2nd day following the past due date, ie on or at any time after the 5 days set in the first chart. Please note that for larger than >50KW customers, EES can by agreement with the customer, further shorten the timeline in the rules.

To facilitate full compliance with the rules regarding valid reasons for termination, issuance of termination notice, and contents of the notice, I have provided short attachements of rule requirements.

"RE: Negative CTC Issues","On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the ""high"" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to ""re-bill"" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.

On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all ""high"" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.

Two questions:

    1.  How do we fight the notion that a FERC retroactive determination of ""just and reasonable rates"" should be re-injected into the calculation of negative CTCs?  It seems to me that there are at least equitable arguments against that.  Will this be a CPUC or FERC issue?

    2.  Can we use the utilities' underscheduling to push them back on this, legally or in negotiations?   Since they contributed to the market disfunction, shouldn't they have to live with the consequences?

Dave, per your request: 

Here are some bullets briefly describing the FERC audit high points.  I think the scope is ""right on the money"" and the timing is reasonably good also.  The text of the audit solicitation follows the bullets.  I've made contact with Andy Sakallaris, head of FERC procurement, to attend the pre-bid conference next Tuesday (assuming it is held, since expressions of interest thus far have been from CA based firms unwilling to make the trip to DC).  Ray

Audit description-  FERC seeks to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements in California markets; accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO will be performed to determine any areas in which the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its responsibilities in operating the transmission system under its control and administering real-time energy markets.

Scope- Provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its FERC tariff and determine whether the CAISO's operations are adequately transparent to market participants.

Audit period- 10/1/00-10/1/01

Deliverables timing- Draft report due on January 9, 2002; final report due January 16, 2002.

Audit schedule-  Begins on November 1, 2001, and ends no later than January 4, 2002.

Pre-proposal conference- A conference is scheduled for prospective offerors at FERC next Tuesday; FERC will give a brief explanation of the requirements and clarify any questions asked.

POC Charlotte Handley, 202-219-1156 or Andrew Sakallaris,202-219-1150
DESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial
  items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6,
  as supplemented with additional information included in this
  notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;
  proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will
  not be issued. FERC02RMT22071 is issued as a request for proposal
  and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC
  97-27. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number
  561. Statement of Work: I. BACKGROUND. The California electricity
  market has experienced great stress from Summer 2000 to Summer
  2001, with demand outstripping supply, wholesale prices rising
  dramatically, and key market participants becoming financially
  unstable. As a result, the California Independent System Operator,
  Inc. (CAISO), which operates the electricity transmission grid
  throughout most of California, was forced to adapt to rapidly
  changing circumstances. During all of this, the CAISO worked
  hard to ensure system reliability. Under the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission's market mitigation plan, wholesale prices
  stabilized in California in Summer 2001. The Commission seeks
  to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements
  in California markets, including improvements to help the CAISO
  in effectively performing its increasing responsibilities.
  Accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO
  will be performed to determine the areas, if any, in which
  the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its
  responsibilities in operating the transmission system under
  its control and administering certain real-time energy markets.
  II. SCOPE OF WORK. The Independent Public Accounting (Contractor)
  firm shall perform an operational audit of the CAISO processes,
  practices, and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted
  Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The Contractor shall
  provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its
  Commission tariff (procedures and tariff can be found at www.caiso.com).
  The Contractor shall ascertain whether the CAISO's operations
  are adequately transparent to market participants. To the extent
  possible, the Contractor shall also ascertain whether the CAISO's
  procedures and operations are consistent with the most effective
  business practice. III. AUDIT PERIOD. The audit of the CAISO
  shall cover the period commencing October 1, 2000, through
  October 1, 2001. IV. DELIVERABLES. The contractor must provide
  the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a draft
  and final report detailing the findings, operating deficiencies
  and/or major observations and recommendations. These reports
  and other deliverables must be provided to the COR by the close
  of business on the following dates: 1) Draft Report - January
  9, 2002 2) Final Report - January 16, 2002. V. SCHEDULE. The
  operational audit will commence on November 1, 2001, and it
  must be completed no later than January 4, 2002. The contractor
  shall meet with the COR to discuss the audit no later than
  November 6, 2001. The contractor must provide the Commission
  with an operational audit plan no later than November 14, 2001.
  A detailed operational audit plan will be submitted to the
  COR for review, feedback, and approval. The COR or designated
  representative will review the plan. VI. Working Papers. The
  contractor shall prepare and provide a copy of work papers
  in accordance with GAGAS. All work papers shall include the
  purpose, sources of information, the procedures performed,
  results thereof, and conclusions as appropriate for the planning,
  internal control, compliance, and substantive testing phases.
  For all findings, work papers shall clearly show the condition
  or problem, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendation for
  improvement. All working papers shall be cross-referenced to
  audit programs, summaries, and final audit report. These documents
  will become the property of the Commission. During the course
  of the audit or upon completion of the audit work, the Contractor's
  audit report and work papers shall be subject to access and
  review by the Commission. A preproposal conference is scheduled
  for prospective offerors at FERC on Tuesday, October 16, 2001,

  Technical Proposal: Past Performance (30 points). Ensure that
  the company names, points of contact and phone numbers are
  current. The Offeror and each subcontractor proposed must each
  select three references to complete a ""Contractor Past-Performance
  Evaluation."" All areas of the sheet must be filled in. If an
  answer to a specific question is not provided, the applicable
  area must be annotated with the reason why (e.g. ""Reference
  failed to provide an answer""). Higher scores will be assigned
  for contracts that are at least similar in size and complexity.
  FERC may obtain and evaluate information from sources other
  than those provided by the offeror. FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) states
  ""In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past
  performance or for whom information on past performance is
  not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or
  unfavorably on past performance."" For the purposes of this
  evaluation not being evaluated favorably or unfavorably means
  the offeror will receive a rating of ""good or acceptable"" on
  company past performance. To obtain a copy of the past performance
  form to be completed by the Offeror's references, request from
  A. Sakallaris by email. The Offeror will be responsible and

Yes, that's the point.  PG&E should have used the existing accumulated credit balances to clear the final DEBIT bills.  Instead, they cleared Enron's credit balances BEFORE they calculated the final bill.  Then they transferred the amount, which Enron is responsible for, to the customers' first utility bill.

The customer is not entitled to the credits.  The credits were transferred, then final DA bills calculated and transferred to the customer.  The customer is NOT responsible for these final bills.  Had PG&E not transferred the Enron credits, the final debit bills would have been taken against the credits.

Jim,  as far as we know, PG&E is doing this on residential accounts only.  Remember that residential contracts were terminated in May and all accounts returned to utility service.  Instead of using the accumulated credits to clear the final direct access bills, PG&E transferred the credits, then calculated the final amounts.  These debits were then transferred to the customers PG&E bills.  These accounts were NOT reDASRed, so they are no longer Enron customers.  

I have requested a list of all credits transferred from Enron residential customers accounts, plus a listing of direct access bills transferred to these customers.  In the meantime, I feel we need to submit a formal request.

All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent.

I made a quick call to Dynegy, WIliams and Reliant to see how they were approaching the meeting. 

Williams and Reliant seem to think this is a very positive step, and are bringing decisionmakers and no attorneys.  They each plan to have 2 - 3 people there.  They see this as an opportunity to have FERC staff ask the ISO some hard questions and demand some answers.

Dynegy is less optimistic.  It currently plans to bring Joel Newton out, its FERC attorney, but that decision is ""subject to change."" Dynegy agreed that the letter and approach were strange.

All three will have someone there who can make decisions and agree to protocols. We may want to do the same -- if we can get someone to come from the desk.

After looking at the EPSA draft documents (Craig Roach etc.), here are some thoughts.  Also, it seems that we should be able to work with EPSA (then hopefully it can be Enron's position, as well).  
 
Ideas for Determining Market Power mitigation:
--How long can price be influenced?  (for example, a generator in a load pocket vs. DSM, onsite generation, new transmission, new technologies, additional generator).
--Price spikes in times of shortage are normal -- This can signal the need for more generation, gas, etc.  Prices should reflect costs that are incurred during drilling, etc./ keeping rigs available, etc.
--Market Power can be mitigated in a variety of ways by new entry through IPPs, merchant transmission, regular cost based transmission, access to interconnectiion and transmission on a non-discriminatory basis.
-- Need real time price and other RTO information (transparency) in order to effectively monitor and to send good price signals for the new entrants (who are putting their capital at risk, rather than the traditional cost -based, almost guaranteed recovery).

Hello Jim- 

Greetings from the sweltering city of Washington!  Per our conversation, you know that we are hosting a one day meeting on market based rate analysis here in Washington in September to ""roll up our sleeves"" and develop an official EPSA position, if possible, as FERC moves forward on the issue.  What I'd like to get out of this message is where Enron stands - what is your take on the hub and spoke, and what are your suggested alternatives?  I'd like to get a heads up of our members' perspectives on the matter prior to the meeting so as to structure the agenda in the most effective and helpful manner.

As you know, Commissioner Massey has been very vocal about re-evaluating the hub and spoke, and we now have Commissioner Brownell voicing similar concerns.  Whether or not we see a NOPR in the future is anyone's call, but I'd like EPSA to be an industry leader if and when the opportunity arises.  Any help you can provide would be appreciated.

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

I think we should try to get a coalition tgether, but I would be more inclined to approach the Michigan and Indiana Commissions than Ohio or Illinois.  On a separate note, the advantage of an investigation over a complaint is that we dont have the burden of proof and getting the info to concretely prove what we suspect can at times be difficult if we go the complaint route.  Depends on the facts and the case. the meeting with Cinergy could be a good entre into getting a coalition together to approach FERC.

At this point we dont have draft language and we dont have a settlement with language that allows us to push the way we can in Ohio.  My thought was to push for an investigation and see within that context how far we could go.  At a minimum, if a hearing were to be granted, I think we could end up improving the balancing rules for IP, CILCO, etc.  Com Ed has the most favorable provisions and could end up being the model.  In my discussions with Jeff Merola and Rogers Herndon, they can work with this however it is not optimal.  They need to do a transaction in order to figure out where the bugs are.

Subject:	ICC- Balancing

On Friday, I participated in ICC Chairman Mathias' Roundtable on the state of competition in Illinois.  One of the questions he asked was what the ICC could do to improve competition in Illinois.  I commented that the ICC could commence an investigation on the balancing rules of the various utilities, having pointed out the problem's with ComEd's and the fact that the other utilities are even worse.  He expressed concern over ICC jurisdiction and opined that to the extent that it impacts retail transactions and adversely affects retail competition, the ICC is within its jurisdiction to order the utilities to file an amended OATT before FERC for FERC's approval.  I plan to follow-up with a letter to him and all the Commissioners and would like feedback as to how hard I should push on this.  Should the ICC look into balancing (to which I give a less than 50% probability) we would have to be prepared to participate.  I think it would be highly worth the effort, especially as far as Illinois Power is concerned, however, I would like some feedback as to your views in order to guage how hard to push this.

Thanks,
Janine

Subject: IMPORTANT ! : Motion of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-E) for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Order Shortening Time


Yesterday, SDG&E filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cost recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file comments on the mechanism.  The attached email from SDG&E contains the motion, an executive summary, and a detailed summary of  their proposals and recommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDG&E's customers.  The utility requests a 15-day comment period, which means comments would have to be filed by September 10 (September 8 is a Saturday).  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later.

The filing provides the following discussion of direct access:


  _____  

""Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent to which they might be served instead by third party providers. The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct access and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of an optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commitments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate direct access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E discusses below how to provide for this coordination. 

As the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections will gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct access is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direct access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly half. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avoid paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspend direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, the legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, and other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effect of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause large quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly. 

These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct access and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elections take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided information on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggregation) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is scheduled to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitments to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller customers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the information it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of over- or under-commitment. 

In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of service would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, and, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct access placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to limit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay an exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retained generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining customers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commodity service to departing customers. Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing, again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch.
 
Coordinating direct access with the planning process, at least for a near-term period, is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan.""

  _____  


The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role:

  _____  

""When the State embarked on industry restructuring, one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide. Although California's experience with markets has not been as anticipated, it is still possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regulatory oversight can offer advantages to consumers. In fact, some states have undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers' net short requirements. For example, in parts of Pennsylvania, the State decided to auction off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market. California may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing. If a portion of the net short is auctioned off in this manner, from a planning standpoint, it should be treated the same as direct access: SDG&E will need adequate notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short position remaining to be served, and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fees should also apply.""

  _____  


There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment upon, as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings.  Please let me (and others) know if you agree.

Attached is a matrix that identifies our current State Licenses.  We work directly with EES Legal for license renewals and new registrations.  As Craig has indicated below, our records indicate we are current for both Licensing and Bond Requirements in Illinois at a State Level.

As EES is currently pursuing Supplier Billing Option (SBO) behind Commonwealth Edison, we will have to comply with the credit worthiness requirements outlined by Gloria, but my understanding of her email indicates we currently meet these standards and will only be required to supply funds in the event our credit rating drops further.

In any case, our records show that EES is current and compliant.  EES was granted a retail license in August 1999.  To maintain the license, EES must submit an annual ""Re-certification"" and keep a bond current.  A Re-certification application was submitted on 1/31/01 and the  bond was extended through 6/1/02.

I hope this answers your concerns.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions and/or require further information.



Craig

As I mentioned previously, ARM is supporting the SCE approach which does not charge DA customers for the 1 cent.  ARM is working with the Energy Div staff to get a favorable ruling on it.  We decided that approach had the highest probability of success.  But ARM will seek to change the earlier order charging DA if this approach doesn't work. 

 I have not really talked to other ARM members on the PX Credit balances.  I can if you like.  I believe we should follow the requirements in our tariff and ESP/UDC agreement for a dispute as the best first step.

Hey there Jim.  I'm glad you made it back in one piece.  I'm sure your wife was frantic.  

FYI:  This past week-end, Becky and I attended NESA's annual conference.  One of the highlights was a panel entitled ""Power Deregulation.""  On the panel:  Brad Williams, Sr. VP, Entergy Wholesale Operations;  Michael Schneider, Director, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E); Steve Gillialand, Sr. VP, Duke Energy North America, LLC; and Jerry Winter, VP, Reliant Energy Services.  Note: Loretta Lynch, President, CPUC was scheduled to participate on the panel as well, but she was a no-show.  My guess - she chickened out.  It was probably for the best because everyone on the panel ""slammed"" California, the Governor, and the CPUC.

I had the opportunity of questioning Michael Schneider (I asked these via note cards) of SDG&E in regards to Open Access and where did it look like the legislature was going with it and what was SDG&E's position.  On record, he said that open access will pass through legislature but that it would be ""segmented.""  For example, depending on the size of the customer would depend on if they can participate in regards to open access.  The Large customers can have the opportunity to participate in open access but supposedly because the smaller customers ""aren't really educated"" on the issues of open access, they won't be able to participate.  (Sounded rather patronizing to me, even if he was rather pleasant.)  How does SDG&E feel about open access?  He said that they're definitely in favor of  open access and feel that it is needed but only for large customers and that the smaller customers aren't ""quite ready"" for open access because again lack of education.  Supposedly the smaller customers aren't sophisticated enough I guess.

Jim, question - is this something everyone on the Ca. calls already know including you or should I send this out to others as a ""FYI"" ?

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

I have received 2 calls in the last two days from EES and ENA (Lance Hinricks and David Porter) wanting to know the details of AZ electric marketing.  They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.

It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.

That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.  

SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds.

I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.  If PG&E reduces going-forward procurement costs to reflect FERC-ordered refunds, I do not understand why it would affect already-issued CTC charges.  The cost of power would be cheaper going forward.

Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

Subject:	RE: PG&E PX Credit Calculation -- CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable ""HC"" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or  ""Est RT$""  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) retail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EPMI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (for example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim states that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the market, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Texas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the imbalance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/02 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.

Jim:

Since I was just called in to the FERC last Friday to talk about RTO
benefits, I was thinking about what we were going to discuss a couple of
Thursdays ago.

Is market power and regional market analysis something that you all talk
about a lot?  I don't know very much about how you are organized, or how
something like this might fit with your agenda.

I'd be happy to talk with you at your convenience, just enough to learn
a little bit more about your thinking.  Perhaps a small group of
like-minded firms could use a piece like this to put in front of the
Commission together.  They like external parties to come in with
concrete proposals, especially if they are already thinking along the
same lines.

Update on the MD EEMC license issue - 

We talked to both Accounting and Resource Planning Staff at the MD Commission and they indicate the remaining outstanding item is a request for an unlimited, unconditional, unrestricted parental guarantee.  Suppliers have been unwilling to provide such a guarantee.  The Commission has been approving these requests for licenses on a 90 day, provisional basis, pending a later determination of how or if they will modify the parental guarantee requirement. 

We will go forward with trying to get this provisional approval tomorrow and then address the guarantee requirements as they become known.

EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  

There have been a number of letters sent dealing with ""questions"" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.

If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.

RE: EPSA Second Draft Comments on Pipeline Capacity
      Recall  NOPR
?			Comments due November 19th
?
As discussed on Wednesday's Conference Call attached are second draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on pipeline capacity recall.  This draft reflects the changes suggested during the conference call. The following are the major changes from the earlier draft:

1. The word ""Opposing"" has been removed from the filing.  Rather the filing retains the same arguments but indicates that EPSA has ""concerns"".

2. We added footnote 1 to stress that in no event should the Commission mandate that such recall provisions be included in a recall notice.  Rather consistent with the NOPR, such recalls should only be permitted, with the ultimate determination being subject to negotiation between the releasing and replacement shipper.

3. We added footnote 3 to recognize that this filing reflects the views of EPSA as an organization, not the views of individual members.

4. We added the footnotes missing from the earlier draft.

5. We did some minor editing to page 3, the first full paragraph.  The sentence starting with ""This service will be of less value to potential purchasers than any firm service the pipeline could offer...."" and well as the next sentence are slightly different than the earlier draft.

Please review the draft and forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Jack Cashin at EPSA at jcashin@epsa.org by close of business on Friday, November 16th so that we can make a timely filing on Monday, November 19th.

Rick:  
As per the discussion this morning, Risk Analytics is currently taking the first pass at our activities to determine if there is any change in the risk exposure that we ought to mitigate.  This may take several days, but perhaps the most pressing one at the moment is the impact of the change in credit rating on the normal business practices including participation in markets, and the cost of transacting in these markets (in case that a financial instrument guarantee is now needed rather than the prerequisite credit rating).  More specifically: 

1.	Credit rating concerns at the wholesale level:  Examples include guarantees of participation in different ISOs and access to transmission systems.
2.	Credit rating concerns at the retail level: Examples include licensing and registration perquisites to market power in the service territory of a distribution company.

I shall keep you posted with progress and with resulting action items.  Of course, please let me know if you have any question/advice.

Let me cogitate on this.  The local counsel we use on electric matters is more of a gas attorney than an electric one, and the counsel we use for the SW Gas matters is also APS's counsel so he can't help us on these matters.  The customers are no allies, since they are happy with their deal, and the only other marketer who was active in the settlement is gone now (the internet marketer from California).  Perhaps we could talk to APS to see what they are thinking.  That might be more enlightening than anything else.  Just a thought.

I would think that we should take the time to talk with local counsel or other ""allies"" to get a feel for the chances in AZ.  I also think that the difficulty in AZ will be a physical problem with getting transmission service - no RTO.

It would be great to have a thorough analysis of problems in every open market just to know what the issues are.

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

I have received 2 calls in the last two days from EES and ENA (Lance Hinricks and David Porter) wanting to know the details of AZ electric marketing.  They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.

It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.

That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.  

SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds.

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his ""legal and tariff guys"" told him that ""they're on solid ground""; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison ""is right.""
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or (""god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Possible to discuss briefly?

EES had won the bid last year and NUI kept our info confidential as well.  With a minimal amount of time and through my relationship with Maloney, NUI agreed to an Off Tariff deal with us giving us our original terms and conditions.

Kenneth Maloney, of Cullen and Dykman, was helpful and responded quickly to my submitted draft comments, as well as returning a signed copy via fax.

They also have to drum up funds to publish each issue of the magazine, so I sent them to Kaufman, who got me into this.  I will keep you posted.

Subject:	EPSA filing on capacity releases

I reviewed the EPSA filing, and I have no problems, but Becky is going to run it by the desk to make sure it is okay with them.  Becky and I have been talking about what we will file and I plan to work on that today and tomorrow, but here is the thumbnail of it.

FERC is trying in the rule to give intraday recall rights to releasing shippers.   If this applies to all transactions, it obviously devalues and degrades capacity releases.  The proper approach is let the parties negotiate the arrangements they want and for the payment to reflect the level of firmness actually given.  In other words, if a releasing shipper wants the recall rights that FERC would give them as a matter of law in this rule, then they spell those rights out in their posting and negotiate the deal with that on the table.  If a shipper is willing to release capacity and forego any recall rights, they should be able to do this, and receive payment that reflects the nature of that service.  But having a rule that mandates recall that cannot be negotiated is uncalled for and contrary to the purposes of capacity release and open access.

I understand the differences.  Becky is going to get on the EPSA call tomorrow and tell them that we are ok with the NOPR (and will file as such) and that EPSA should make sure to not blow up the NOPR (or try).  Becky if EPSA wants complete agreement, then they shouldn't file.  Grab me if you want to talk.

Jim -- Leslie responded that ENA's comments are in favor of the NOPR, as long as the shipper and released-to-customer agree on the terms and subject to legitimate pipeline operational (accounting/balancing) concerns (which accommodate the pipelines' concerns).  Therefore, ENA is taking a different position than EPSA.  Furthermore, EPSA's comments include Dynegy comments against the NOPR.

I agree with ENA's position.  Is this something that EPSA would want agreement of all members to file?  Also, it seems that ENA's approach is consistent with being allowed to make something you purchased into a product that your customer wants.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
      Gas Issues Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
           John Orr, Gas Issues Working Group Chair
           Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
           Jack Cashin, Senior Manager of Policy

DATE: 11/9/2001

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on Pipeline Capacity Recall    
      NOPR 
?			Comments due November 19th
?	Conference Call November 14th
?	
As discussed on the last Gas Issues Working Group conference call, attached are draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on pipeline capacity recall.  EPSA opposes the NOPR because it (a) will reduce competition in the secondary market for transportation services and (b) may reduce the pipeline operational flexibility needed by electric generators.   Thus, EPSA urges the Commission not to impose a broad based recall requirement throughout the natural gas industry but rather gain experience with this difficult issue in individual Order No. 637 proceedings. 

Please review the draft and forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Jack Cashin at EPSA at jcashin@epsa.org by noon on Thursday, November 15th so that we can make a timely filing by Monday, November 19th.  EPSA will hold a conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 1:00 P.M. (EST) to discuss the draft.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Jack Cashin/EPSA Call.

I spoke with Brian Cragg about the Commission's adjustment of QF prices.  He
said that to date they have only done it on a going forward basis.  They did
say when they issued their decision in March which changed the formula for
QF  pricing that they were going to continue their examination of the
formula inputs and additional future changes could be made retroactive to
March.  To date they have not taken further action.

In the past, when the Commission has made changes to rates to reflect
overcollections or undercollections, they have not gone back and
recalculated each bill. The corrections are made on a going forward basis.
Thus in the case of the PX energy charge, the energy charge on customer's
future bills would be reduced to reflect the past over payments.
Conversely, the PX credit would be reduced to reflect the fact that they
were to high in the past.

Not quite sure that I am getting the picture.  Let me lay it out more

The PX Credit for October 2000 was $225 based on the actual market rates.

Now FERC is saying that October 2000 hourly prices for CalPX DA and CalPX
HA markets were ""too high"" in June 2001.  Can the CPUC change the PX Credit
for October 2000 and make the Utilities recalculate our Negative CTC?

   Subject:  CPUC Authority to Adjust Rates

   Jeff and Jim --

   I have done some research into the issue of whether the CPUC would be
   able
   to restate the UDC's PX Energy Charges (and thus PX Credits) back to
   October
   if the FERC were to apply its mitigation plan back that far. Thus far,
   my
   research indicates that the answer is yes (or at least there is a strong
   argument that the answer is yes) and it would not violate the rule
   against
   retroactive rate making.  The reasoning is as follows:

   The Commission (as affirmed by the courts) have ruled that they may
   subject
   a utility's rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to
   a
   methodology or formula adopted before the date the utility's rates
   became
   subject to refund. Thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because
   the
   formulas are in place before the utility's rates are made subject to
   refund.
   The PX Energy Charge is calculated pursuant to the formula/mechanism set
   forth in the utility's tariffs.  These charges were always subject to
   adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process.  The
   change
   in energy prices which would be effected by the FERC ruling could very
   well
   be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula.  Thus the change
   would not be considered retroactive ratemaking.

   I had a chance to talk with Mike Day for a couple of minutes about this
   issue.  He concurred with my analysis.

   Jeanne

It looks like the second ""windfall tax"" bill (ABX2 1 - Corbett) may be heard as early as tomorrow (see Scott's message below).  Among other things, this bill:
 
- Creates a Tax on Excess Gross Receipts from Electrical Energy Distribution and imposes the tax on the person making the first sale of electrical power in CA for consumption.
 
-Establishes a three-tiered tax system.  The measure of the tax is the amount by which the gross receipts from the sale exceed the amount that would have been received if the sale had been made at a specified price (base price) - the ""excess gross receipts"" (ESRs).  
 
-Sets the initial base price at $60/MWhr
 
*Have you been in touch with Vicki Sharp regarding this bill (in addition to the other windfall tax bill we summarized for her - SBX2 1)?  I can send her a summary of the Corbett bill, if you would like.

To the best of my knowledge, Enron has  not produced a document outlining the

Enron provided me, dealt solely with  the constitutional issues.  What has

been conveyed to me unofficially, is  that several of the companies will

likely sue if one or both become  law.  With respect to 2, supposedly Corbett

is reviewing potential amendments to  make hers a simply majority vote bill

Subject:	REVISED EIA Alternate Electric Power Data Confidentiality	Policy

Last week, EPSA met with EIA to discuss a revised Alternate Electric Power Data Confidentiality Policy proposal.  The following are EIA's changes to the original Alternate Policy proposal circulated by EPSA on August 2.

The following items would be held confidential:

EIA - 423: cost of fuels (not previously collected by EIA)
Purchase price would also still be held confidential, as noted on the original Alternate Policy.  EIA-423 basically duplicates FERC Form 423.

EIA-906: fuel stocks (currently held confidential)
Stocks was originally ""crossed out"" on the Alternate Policy, but it is now back on the list of data items to be held confidential.

EIA-826: energy service provider data on sales, revenues and number of customers
Under the original Alternate Policy, regulated utilities and wires companies would have also been able to keep this same information confidential.  Now it will only be data submitted by ESPs that will be held confidential.  However, please note that EIA-861 collects this same data from ESPs and that data will be released on an annual basis.

EIA-767: Under the revised Alternate Policy, no data submitted on the 767 will be held confidential
This is a change from the original Alternate Policy.  The original Alternate Policy includes estimated useful thermal output, plant financial information, cooling system costs, etc. as data to be held confidential.  The data will now be released 12 months after year-end.

EIA-860: Maximum tested heat rate (currently confidential)
No change from original Alternate Policy.

EIA-861: No data submitted on the 861 will be held confidential
No change from original Alternate Policy.

EIA-411: No data submitted on the 411 will be held confidential.
No change from original Alternate Policy.

EIA-412: Generator plant costs and expense data only for unregulated plants (not previously collected by EIA)
No change from original Alternate Policy.

I've attached a copy of the original Alternate Policy in case you need it.

Please forward any comments on these changes to me no later than noon Eastern Time on Friday, August 31.

EIA anticipates a Federal Register Notice on or around September 7.  There will then be a 30-day comment period on the proposal submitted by EIA to OMB.  We will notify you when the Federal Register Notice is issued.

Mary Hutzler, Acting Administrator at EIA, has expressed an interest in meeting with EPSA and its members to further discuss these issues.  If there is an interest in EPSA arranging a meeting for members in Washington, D.C. during the next few weeks, please let me know as soon as possible.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

		Energy Imbalances

		1.	Jurisdictional Issues

	The ARES Coalition, Alliant, and IIEC argued that the Commission
should address energy imbalances in the proceeding.  Enron and NewEnergy
abandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison.
Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly
addressed within Edison's OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.


	The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted
litigation and the harm of delay to retail competition, the Commission would
not address the propriety of FERC's asserted authority over energy imbalance
issues.  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way
""waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at
some future time.""

		2.	Factual & Policy Issues

	Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers
containing the following provisions:

*	Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and
settlements will occur on a cash basis for each hour's imbalances;
*	For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2% or less, or 2
MW or less, settlement is made at 100% of out-of-pocket costs (""OPC""),
regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error;
*
*	Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25% of their own
individual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25% of
OPC.  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discounts
applicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount
below.  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows:
*
*	From October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 -- No adder  will
apply under this provision.
*
*	From January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount
will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 20%
or more of the hours of the month.  If the 20% of the hours are exceeded,
the adder/discount shall apply to all hours.
*
*	Starting April 1, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount will apply to those
RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 10% or more of the hours
of the month.  If the 10% of the hours are exceeded, the adder/discount
shall apply to all hours.

*	Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance
attributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs.  If the hourly
imbalance caused by all unbundled retail load, excluding PPO load, is within
the 100 MW bandwidth, no RES (except those whose imbalance exceeds ?25%, as
noted below) will be subject to an adder or discount.  PPO load will, in
aggregate, be subject to the same terms and conditions as above, but
imbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadband
separately from all RES load.

*	Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves,
to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish, before
applying a charge for energy imbalance.  According to Edison, this feature
will allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging
overscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the same
hour.  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100% of Edison's
OPC.  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the
opening of the trading window.
*
*	The net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be charged
an adder or discount of 10%.  This charge will be allocated among RESs who
are out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds
their individual deadband.  The allocation will be based on the ratio-share
of the amount by which these individual RESs' imbalances exceed their
individual deadbands.  Any such adder/discount will be billed separately
from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading. Likewise, any
adder/discount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billed
separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading.
*
*	Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with
seasonal adjustments.  Edison will not require the installation of interval
demand recorders for customers of less than 400 kW at this time.
*
*	Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth (i.e.,
no adders/discounts) when the imbalances are due to (1) Edison interruptions
and restorations, or (2) customer force majeure events, that are in each
case material to the RESs' schedule and of which the RES could not
reasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule.
*
*	Edison will include a description of the methodology for determining
OPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC.

	The IIEC opposed Edison's proposal and requested that the Commission
require Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distribution
level.  Blackhawk also opposed Edison's proposal and supported the IIEC
proposal  Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energy
imbalance service at the distribution level.  Mid-American opposed any
effort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances.

	The Commission failed to weigh-in on the energy imbalance issue
consistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum for
such issues.  The Commission reserved the right to address the issue in some
future FERC proceeding.

Subject: RE: FERC rulemaking on Generator Interconnection


I skimmed the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago.  Although I did not see the word ""congestion"", the implication of what I read is that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion impacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in ""but for"" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude.  Did I?

I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgotten about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this upgrade and ""but for"" stuff, and then ""gives"" it to the utility, are there taxes due on the ""gift""?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the taxes on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned over to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to ""waste"" on an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dept (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was considering.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection to address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC process?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process?  

I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents to the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, ""all generators are good and benefit the ratepayers."")  On fundamental grounds they will resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the insult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades), they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine strongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it.  And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problems around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considering adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the grid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Because all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we supported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now developing in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system upgrades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the ""gift"" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmission system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nice if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of dealing with the tax issues in this NOPR?

Subject:	EES Billing Issues

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

This is to recap our discussion today about two billing issues--recoupment of the PX Credit and the $10 surcharge.  I would appreciate it if those of you with more first-hand information, particularly Wanda and Diann, correct or clarify anything I've misstated.  Also, please forward this to anyone else with an interest in this matter.

A.  Recoupment of the PX Credit (also known as the ""Negative CTC"")

     1.  Background:  The issue here relates to the fact that PG&E and SCE are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers.  Prior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March, the bills would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to T&D charges.  SCE and PG&E have now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us for T&D, despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in PX Credits.  This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opinion of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be collected as a bill credit, and not in cash.  Mike Day, our regulatory lawyer, expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was improper, and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with the CPUC.  Note:  the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which accrued to prior to December 31, 2000; the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrued during that time frame, and there is no dispute as to the proper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame.  Furthermore, PG&E and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that had accrued as of December 31, 2000.

    2.   Action Items/Issues:  (a)  With respect to SCE, Legal is evaluating filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC.  The CPUC has a process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our customers while the issue is being determined (by depositing the payments in an interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC); while there is no equivalent procedure in federal court, one can request that the court enter an injunction against the utilities disconnecting customers.   While the analysis is worth doing, I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the CPUC for relief.  (b)  With respect to PG&E, the banruptcy team is evaluating whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court.

    3.  Timing:  Late fees will begin accruing August 20.  The first disconnect notices would not be received until September 19.

    4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in court to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effect on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and prospectively.

B.  $10 Surcharge

     1.  Backgound:  Although when provisionally imposed in January the $10 surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent,  when made permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWR's purchases of power on behalf of the utilities.  This evolution gives rise to two bases for EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the $10 surcharge.  First, since the $10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing generation for bundled customers only, and not direct access customers, direct access should not have to pay it.  This is the same logic that caused the CPUC to exempt direct access customers from the $30 surcharge.
Secondly, if legitimately applied to direct access, because it is of no direct benefit to direct access customers it (arguably) can only be viewed as a tax.  Under EES's contracts with its customers, taxes assessed at the delivery point are borne by the customer.  Note:  SCE, unlike PG&E, may not impose the $10 surcharge on direct access customers, according to a filing made at the staff level at the CPUC, so this action may relate to PG&E only.

     2.  Action Items/Issues:  (a)  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) has the lead in advising us about a challenge to the application of the $10 surcharge to direct access customers at the CPUC.  It may be advisable for an industry group rather than Enron to make the filing.  (b)  I would expect that we would follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with the CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected.  In the interim we would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if our challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is successful. (c) A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 when the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was first imposed.

     3.  Timing.  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect notices.

     4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) will analyze with the appropriate people the effect, if any, of taking this position on other CTC issues (principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and prospectively). 

End.

It is important to point out that under the Bingaman reliability language, FERC has total discretion as to whether to adopt a NERC standard.  Charles does make a good point about the deference language.  As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance.  At a minimum, that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB.  Similarly, the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC.

I understand that the NERC needs to be recognized for political reasons - but this shuts out the possibility of a EISB.  Since it recognizes RTOs, it should alos leave open the possibility of yet another entity to perform the reliability standards setting function,  at least allow for the RTOs to work through a central standards setting organization other than NERC.

"RE: RTO week follow up","Great idea.  

My key points would be that (a) FERC needs to push ahead with its ""right sized"" RTOs and (b) focus on standardizing the tariff and market design [no more collaborative efforts].  Two simple, easy to understand thoughts.  

Also, I think that it's a mistake to use the term ""large RTOs"".  We don't want large RTOs.  We want RTOs that cover natural markets and benefit consumers.

Jeremy --

To let you know where we stand on the CPUC's Investigation on DA Suspension.  

1.	Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.

2.	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.

3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.

4.	At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM.  We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.

If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.

Please find attached a 3rd draft of the Joint Stipulation of Issues.  It attempts to reflect the comments of about 20 of the TFG's participants.

No one has requested a conference call.

Please keep in mind this is a DRAFT that will be circulated to all parties to EL01-10 tomorrow.  It will no doubt be subject to further negotiation.  While it is highly unlikely that all the parties will reach agreement on a Joint Stipulation by the due date on the procedural schedule(i.e., Thursday, August 16), we nevertheless should make an effort to get it out to the other parties as early as possible tomorrow.

Accordingly, please propose only those additional revisions that you feel are critical at this time.  If I have not heard from you by 10:00 a.m. EDT tomorrow, August 15, I will go ahead and serve the other parties with the document conspicuously marked ""DRAFT"".

With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.

I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.

While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.  

I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.

For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.

This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.

Thanks - I appreciate your help,

Dorothy Rothrock of CMTA boiled down the previous version to the core issues
that the majority of DAC members appear to support.  As before, please also
let me know if you cannot sign on to the letter--which will save us
pestering you with phone calls.  For those of you who aren't signing on to
any letter because of the language supporting SB 18xx--you don't have to

Cmmr. Bilas issued an alternate yesterday on the suspension of direct
access.  The draft is for informational purposes only -- no comments are

Essentially the draft updates his alternate from June.  It does not suspend
direct access but opens a proceeding addressing issues surrounding the
suspension. The alternate contains some good language slamming DWR and its
potentially high price contracts.

I do not have an electronic version of the  alternate.  Let me know if you

"RE: Partial variance to AAC R14-2-1606(b)","I would probably utilize either EPSA or WPTF to make the filing.  This is an attack on the competitive generation industry and better to not have Enron point any fingers at a key ""potential"" customer.

Leslie,

I have just completed reviewing the APS filing.  This paper explains much of the observed behavior of APS during the DSTAR (WestConnect) proceedings over the last several months.

The paper is so full of market ""scare"" tactics it seems appropriate to be reading it during the Halloween season.  The token effort of procuring 270MWs starting 2003 and ramping up to 1670 MWs in 2008 is ridiculous.  The statements that APS generation is somehow more secure and reliable than any generation not owned by APS, using the same grid, and that non-APS generators have little if any responsibility to the ""Full-Requirements"" customers are all beyond belief.  

The mis-characterization of the problems experienced in CA, OR and WA and the contemptuous citing of ""experts"" seems typical of the APS distain for deregulation.

The entire filing is more like a guaranteed plan to recover the ""Billion"" dollars invested by APS, with convenient adjustment clauses every three years.

As you noted earlier today, the Commissioner of the ACC may be more concerned over the APS stock price than truly encouraging open markets and retail access and what better why to help the stock price than to award APS a 14 year contract...look at what the Defense Department did for Lockheed!!!

I spoke with Chris Lackey who met earlier this month with Pinnacle West's (APS subsidiary) head of Trading who told him that PinWest is very conservative (as stated in the filing), their primary function is to support APS and they saw no real opportunities to conduct business with Enron.  However that could change if their petition is denied.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.  If this is approved by the ACC I assume it must then go to FERC, do we have an opportunity to intervene with the ACC and/or FERC in regards to this filing?  If we do, I'll be happy to help you with composition of the documents.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Jim,

	WSCC is voting on the formation of the WECC which will consolidated WSCC with the Western Regional Transmission Association and the Southwest Regional Transmission Association.  The Northwest Regional Transmission Association is likely to follow.  In order for this proposal to pass, 85% of the members must vote in favor and 90% of the control area MWs.  I think we should be there to vote for approval of the proposal.  In addition to combining the three (and possibly four) organizations, the change will alter the board make up, bringing independent members onto the board and allowing more latitude in membership.  The committees will be reevaluated as well and restructured over then next 2-3 years.

	Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board, so I talked to him about coverage.  He seemed to be uncertain about his availability.  I have an RTO West Congestion Management Meeting, where we are closing in on the final details of a financial rights model based on nodal pricing in real time.  I think I need to be there to keep the thing from getting fouled up.  Dave is close in Phoenix, so that was the reason that we tentatively made a reservation for him at the hotel.

A couple of points --

1.	The language in the relief indicates that we are trying to ""determine the validity and amount of PX Credits owed to EES and EEMC"".  Is this correct?  Isn't our primary goal in this complaint to (a) have the Utility return the net credit to our bills and (b) to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges?

2.	Throughout the document the idea of ""T&D charges"" is used.  I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges?  We pay CTC and public purpose costs as well as T&D.

3.	Not sure if CPUC regulates the ESPs.  The filing makes this case in the first paragraph.

Thanks,

Jim

"RE: Market Based Rate (MBR) Position Piece for EPSA--Calll Notes and the Latest Draft","Looks good.  I agree that making arguments about merchant generation ""stranded costs"" is questionable, better to couch this as ""structural impact on market participants"".  More importantly, if I bought 50% of generation in one market, and FERC changes their rules, seems like I either (a) sell generation and take the loss or (b) get regulatory risk insurance.  FERC has the right to make markets work.

Finally, on the issue of blanket authority, I think that the CAISO model is a good example of why this may not work for Enron.  In the long-run, as a market-maker, Enron needs workable markets.  A good test case would have been this - under FERC's proposed rules, would FERC have granted market-wide waiver in California?  If FERC is comfortable with the result, than move ahead.

Subject:	Market Based Rate (MBR) Position Piece for EPSA--Calll Notes and the Latest Draft

On today's call:

It is clear this paper's value is as much to get EPSA member's educated as it is to educate FERC staff.  Julie S. was adamant the FERC staff need some input. I trust her judgement so I too support  getting a ""leave behind"" to them even if EPSA's position is still evolving.

I think we can support Craig Roach's advice, which is in the draft, to go for the Economic Capacity test, which is a simplified Delivered Price Test.   As with any test, the devil is in the  details but everyone on the call seems this test can be kept simple. Craig agreed to send me an example of such a test. 

Most of Jim's issues got raised in the call and will be incorporated in the draft.

The tension/dilemma of trading off 1x, supplier-specific MBR certificate for a blanket MBR certificate to any participant in a properly structured RTO came up several times.  Everyone recognizes that we'll need a replacement for hub-N-spoke before RTO's will obviate the need for certificates altogether.  That being said, I still think we should support such a trade because it keeps a beneif of  RTOs (everone gets MBR) highly visible.

The highlight of the call was Huntoon's/Dynegy's request to raise the stranded costs created by changing the standard for MBR.  Julie said it would not pass the laugh test but he would not back down.  I tend to agree with Julie:  if you built an asset on getting market based rates and because of a change in standards you are forced to cost-of-service, I am hard pressed to agree you have a valid stranded cost claim (i.e., you will still get return of and return on your plant).  I think it is better to focus on the going-forward impact of bad tests (e.g., loss of investors, loss of market participants, etc.)

Finally, all of Chriti's comments were essentially addressed between the 1st and 2nd drafts. 

Because the call got unwieldy, Julie allowed another round of comments, due mid-day Tues, with the hope of getting it out the door next week.

Please review my attached comments by COB Monday.  I would like to forward them onto EPSA late Monday.

Alan

Yes, Susan is the lead and I have a call in to her now to see if she is coming up for the conference next week.  In response to your earlier email about filling in the Team Coverage chart due to Tom Briggs' departure, this is what Linda and Rick and I talked about earlier this week (you were unable to come to the meeting because you were at the EPSA Reg Affairs meeting).

Tom was on the Standards of Conduct team and was the inside counsel writing out comments.  Leslie has agreed to write all of the comments with support on our native load position from Christi and me on an as needed basis.

Tom was the lead on the market based rate inquiry.  We put Donna on as the lead for that proceeding.  She's been following it pretty closely and is on top of the FERC process/procedure aspect of whatever needs to be done.  Alan will provide the technical consulting part (and we may need outside consulting as well) but Donna will be responsible for organizing the team and doing an initial draft of the comments (if or when we need to write comments).

Tom was on a couple of other teams, but because he was not taking a lead role, I don't think he needs to be replaced.

Let me know what you think.

Calvin,  per our discussion,  at the time we returned our commercial customers to utility service earlier this year,  all accounts had accrued credit balances.  PG&E transferred these credits off each account as they were setting them up for utility billing.

These same accounts are now being returned to direct access.  We began receiving the first DA bills from PG&E earlier this month, all with zero beginning balances.  Enron expects that all credit balances will be reinstated on the respective accounts before the next billing cycle.

Proposed Rate Agreement Between The California Department
Of Water Resources And The California Public Utilities Commission

****************************************************************************
*************


BACKGROUND
At the peak of California's electricity crisis, two of California's
investor-owned utilities were financially unable to purchase electricity on
behalf of their customers. AB 1x (Keeley), Chapter 4, Statutes of 2001,
authorized the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to begin
buying power on behalf of the customers of those two utilities and San Diego
Gas & Electric ratepayers, as well as to issue bonds to finance such
purchases. DWR wasn't authorized to utilize the credit of the state to back
those purchases. Instead, it was authorized to recover the money needed to
pay for its electricity purchases through electric rates charged to
consumers and to perform is own ""reasonableness review"" of those costs. The
California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) discretion to perform a
reasonableness review is rarely abrogated (an exception being the costs of
collective bargaining agreements), but AB 1x made an exception in this case
for two basic reasons: First, if the CPUC decided to preclude certain power
costs from being passed along to ratepayers, the effect would be to simply
shift those costs from ratepayers to taxpayers. Second, the goal of a
reasonableness review, which is to create an incentive to do the best
possible job, on behalf of the ratepayers could be accomplished through DWR'
s accountability to ratepayers. The theory was the political process would
provide the check on DWR's activities much in the same way customers provide
a check on the activities of a municipal utility.

To fulfill its obligations under AB 1x, DWR spent $7.6 billion through May
2001. That money was originally loaned from the General Fund. In addition,
the state obtained a short-term bank loan of $4.3 billion to help pay for
ongoing electricity purchases. That short-term loan, the outstanding debt
owed to the General Fund, and the difference between actual electricity
costs and electricity rates paid to DWR will all be financed through a $12.5
billion bond offering, which was authorized by SB 31x (Burton), Chapter 9,
Statutes of 2001, and may take place as early as October. DWR has stated
that the bond offering is contingent upon the CPUC taking a number of
actions on August 23, 2001, one of which is to approve the DWR-constructed
Rate Agreement (Agreement) between DWR and the CPUC.

The Agreement provides the irrevocable contractual and enforceable assurance
that the CPUC will allow DWR's electricity power purchase costs to be
recovered in a timely manner. Specifically, the Agreement:

Creates a Rate Covenant where the CPUC acknowledges DWR's right to recover
its self-determined revenue requirement as specified;
Defines DWR's revenue requirement to include the repayment of the bonds, the
cost of DWR's electricity procurement, including the long-term contracts,
administrative, consulting and legal costs, and the cost of demand
management programs;
Requires the CPUC to establish rates to allow recovery of DWR's revenue
requirement within 30 days or 90 days, as determined by DWR;
Authorizes DWR to take the CPUC to court to enforcement its provisions.
DWR has stated the Agreement is an essential element to obtaining the bond
financing. J.P. Morgan, the senior managing underwriter for the DWR bonds,
has similarly stated that without the Agreement, the bonds won't be viewed
as investment grade quality, thereby jeopardizing the bond issuance.
The Agreement is currently being considered by the CPUC. A number of
parties, including small and large consumer groups who will be responsible
for paying the rates, along with the investor-owned utilities, have
commented on DWR's proposed Agreement and raised a number of concerns. The
Treasurer has offered some suggested amendments to the Agreement to try and
answer some of the concerns without impairing his ability to sell the bonds.

Issues & Questions The Committee May Wish To Consider




Must an Agreement be Signed?

AB 1x permits the CPUC to enter into a rate agreement with DWR, but such an
agreement is not required by the statute. Given the irrevocable nature of
DWR's proposed Agreement, is it necessary for the CPUC to approve the
agreement, or will some other, less binding agreement suffice? One alternate
approach to the Agreement is SB 18xx (Burton), which provides a dedicated
rate to pay for the bonds and specifies exactly what DWR may include as a
part of its costs. SB 18xx passed the Senate 35-2 on July 20, 2001, and is
pending at the Assembly desk.

Public Review

DWR's revenue requirement, at least as it pertains to power purchase costs,
bond repayment, and associated administrative costs, clearly isn't subject
to CPUC review or adjustment pursuant to AB 1x. Rather than have an
independent party like the CPUC review its efforts, AB 1x envisioned that
public review and accountability would motivate DWR to do the best possible
job to get the best value possible for ratepayers. However, the Agreement
neither contemplates nor provides for public review, which has raised
concerns from a number of parties about what costs beyond the cost of buying
power DWR is attempting to pass along to ratepayers as a part of the
Agreement.

Scope of Revenue Requirement

AB 1x specifically permits DWR to cover the cost of the bonds, power
purchases, and associated administrative costs. The Agreement submitted by
DWR to the CPUC for adoption allows DWR to recover much more than those
costs, including the cost of demand management programs and legal,
consulting, and technical services. By including such costs in the
Agreement, these costs are subject to neither legislative nor public review.
The demand management programs have historically been the purview of the
CPUC. (The California Independent System Operator has attempted this year to

create and administer some of these programs with mixed success.) However,
DWR has no background in demand management and no public process for
considering and approving such programs. Given the lack of a public process
and DWR's lack of expertise on demand management programs, is it appropriate
to allow DWR to include the unknown costs of these programs in the
Agreement?

30 and 90 Day Review

The Agreement requires the CPUC to review and implement rates which allow
DWR to recover its revenue requirement within 90 days, or 30 days if DWR
finds that an expedited change is necessary. This is an extremely short
window of time for the CPUC to analyze any DWR request and provide for full
public review and comment.

Auditing

DWR's revenue requirement will be tens of billions of dollars which will be
paid for exclusively by the ratepayers of the state's investor-owned
utilities. Despite the fact that billions of dollars will be changing hands,
the Agreement fails to include an auditing requirement to ensure that
appropriate revenues are provided to DWR, that surplus revenues are returned
to ratepayers, and that there is ongoing monitoring of DWR's accounts.

Court Challenges

The purpose of the rate agreement is to facilitate the issuance of the bonds
to repay the General Fund and the short-term loan. It's possible that some
party may challenge this Agreement or any of the other related CPUC
decisions (i.e. establishing the DWR revenue requirement, creating a
servicing agreement between DWR and the utilities, etc.), in either federal
or state court. How will such a challenge effect the issuance of the bonds?

Contract Renegotiation

The DWR contracts, negotiated at the height of the energy crisis, are viewed
by some as expensive. The state and ratepayers would certainly be better off
if those contracts can be renegotiated based upon current circumstances. The
Agreement binds the CPUC to set rates sufficient for DWR to recover its
revenue requirement, including the cost of the contracts it has already
signed. Does the signing of this Agreement diminish DWR's ability or
incentive to renegotiate any of the contracts? Does it eliminate any
incentive DWR has to negotiate the best possible price on any future
contracts that it may sign, since the costs of those contracts won't be
subject to review or adjustment?

Focus on Electric Deregulation Fades at High Point, N.C., Meeting 
Jacob McConnico 

Aug. 10, 2001 
Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN 
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) 

High Point electric utilities officials, city staff and elected leaders plan to spend the next two days talking about power issues ranging from saving residents money to unloading some of the city's debt. The 35th ElectriCities Annual Meeting gets started today with registration from 2 to 7 p.m. in New Bern. The conference shifts into high gear, with daylong meetings, presentations and demonstrations planned for Friday and Saturday. High Point Mayor Arnold Koonce, City Manager Strib Boynton and councilmen Ron Moore and Ron Wilkins will attend the two-day event. 

Koonce said the annual meeting provides a rare opportunity for High Point officials to meet with leaders from the 50 other cities and towns across the state that run their own power systems. The group meets under the umbrella of ElectriCities, a nonprofit group formed in 1965 to handle many of the issues that arise from municipal power distribution.

""It's the only time, unless you call a special meeting, that these officials get together in one place,"" Koonce said. ""We get to find out what is happening throughout all of the ElectriCities.""

ElectriCities provides customer service and safety training, emergency and technical assistance, communications, government affairs and legal services to its 51 members. The group also provides management services to the state's two municipal power agencies, N.C. Municipal Power Agency Number 1, which includes High Point and Lexington, and N.C. Eastern Municipal Power Agency.

Representatives from across the state will attend the meeting, and Moore said he is most interested in learning about progress on restructuring the $5.4 billion debt owed by ElectriCities and its members.

Moore said it is imperative for Duke Energy Corp. to obtain recertification from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Catawba and McGuire nuclear power plants, which supply power to High Point and other members of ElectriCities. Recertification would allow the plants to operate for an additional 20 years, making it possible for ElectriCities to refinance its debt.

""I want to learn more about the effects of restructuring our debt on our customers,"" Moore said. ""I want to know where ElectriCities stands on restructuring the debt, and where Duke is on getting this recertification.""

Boynton echoed Moore's sentiments, but said this year's meeting will be a little different than last year's meeting because attendees will not be as worried about the possibility of the state deregulating the power industry.

""I think deregulation is effectively a dead issue because of the trouble they have had in California,"" Boynton said. ""This meeting, however, is critically important because the electric fund makes up about $80 million of our annual budget. It's the single-largest part of our budget. Most of the decisions are made by ElectriCities, so it is critical for the Council to attend this meeting.""

In the press releases I saw that NSTAR filed yesterday (10/15) with the DTE to decrease rates.  I have checked both the DTE and NSSTAR website but they are not posted yet.  I would like to get a copy of the NSTAR filing as soon as possible.  Enron Direct is anxious to determine the level of decrease so we can assess our product viability.

In addition, have you heard anything regarding WMECO making a filing to lower their rates.

"EES vs. SCE Complaint RE:  Negative CTC Recoupment - TO BE FILED AUG 29, 2001","Richard, etal  --

Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC.  As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.  

This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.  Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.

One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.  Probably not too big of a downside.

We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

Jim

As a matter of fact, I disputed their calculations when I was there.  They are basing our deposits on the total charges rather than just the transmission and distribution charges, which is all we are responsible for.  According to them, they do not distinguish between DA and bundled charges.

Jim, do you feel we have any recourse in challenging SCE's methodology for calculating these requirements?

We need to read the tariff and understand SCE's security requirement and then extrapolate potential requirements based on our expected load.

Does it make sense to offer the guaranty for $50mm and move on?

Bill, not sure what ""effective"" date is needed.    Our customer accounts began switching to direct access in late June.  As for the maximum requirement, the amount is dictated by SCE.  When I met with Kim Santa Cruz, et al, on August 9, the amount they calculated for EESO was at $37,111,872.  It is likely that amount has gone up, but I have received no official request since then.

Clement, do you know what the latest security requirement is?

Given the nature of progress in the past, I wouldn't want to hang my hat on saying that the guaranty can be completed within a day or two.  What I can do to push the process ahead quicker is to provide comments to the extent that they are absolute and necessary and then leave it with Southern to say that they can or cannot accommodate us.

Teresa,

Teresa, I believe you understand what the negotiation pattern has been between Enron Corp. and Southern California Edison.  It has not changed, especially given the fact that once again I have received a form of guaranty that is different than before and would need to be modified in order to be acceptable to Enron Corp.  I received the guaranty and have not been able to address it because I have been busy preparing items for the upcoming Enron Corp. board meeting.  And, just as in the past, Enron Corp. and Southern California Edison has not been able to come to any agreement as to what the form will look like.  My question is, why is it the case that it is the ninth hour when it is determined that Enron Corp. has to deliver a guaranty, especially to Southern California Edison (a Counterparty where it is well known that there will be problems with the format)?  Surely, we are keeping track of our credit limits and the time frames in which they can to be exceeded.  There will be a negotiation process and it may not necessarily meet the time frame that you have mentioned below.

Subject:	Draft revisions to the 9/6/01 Bingaman reliability provision

Enclosed is my draft of possible revisions to the above-referenced reliability provision, taking into
account suggestions by Craig. I have enclosed a redline version and a clean one. The revision does
the following:
1.By adding""without hindering reliable, non-discriminatory, and efficiently priced transmission service""
it uses words of art from FERC Order No. 2000 and shows the intertwined nature of security and commercial practices.
2.By adding the reference to section 201(f), it specifically includes  Federal and State entities.
3.There is no named reference for any particular industry  standards body---thus no attempt to either
provide an advantage or disadvantage to any existing body.
4.The FERC could take into consideration recommendations of enties with technical expertise regarding reliability standards---such as WECC , Regional Advisory Bodies, and the States.
5. FERC could assign enforcement responsibility in a given area to any appropriate entity---such as WECC or RTOs.
6.It puts in a definition of reliability standards that is limited to security and, by not including adequacy, is
not as intrusive on prerogatives of States.
7.I bracketed the possibility of a States savings provision for further consideration. Of course, the
narrower the scope---i.e. no consideration of generation adequacy---the less need there is for such
a provision.
Please give me any feedback.

Subject:	Draft House Staff Reliabilty Language


EPSA had wanted comments by Noon today on the House staff draft on reliability (hence I have copied them on this e-mail).  There has been e-mail traffic between and among many if not all of us as we have looked at this langauge and as Charles and I have had various conversations with EPSA staff.  Below are some comments and some issue spotting to get your reaction as we continue to evaluate this important subject.

1.	The House staff draft (supposedly based on informal Administration language) does appear to be an improvement over the NERC language -- the extent to which it is so is open to interpretation and judgment.  While it is shorter and does NOT have the regional entities and variances in the NERC language, the basis of the House staff draft is still an ERO.  I thought we did not want an ERO of any kind, particularly one created by statute.  On the other hand, some argue an ERO of some type is inevitable and task should be to give FERC as much control over it as obtainable.  Furthermore, the House staff draft appears to make approving an ERO discretionary with FERC (the text says FERC ""may"" certify an applicant to be the ERO).

2.	Given that the House staff draft is an improvement -- and it is a welcome development that it is NOT the NERC language -- it would be a major tactical victory to have both the Senate and the House mark up vehicles WITHOUT the NERC ""consensus text.""  Since EPSA is the group most likely to NOT want NERC at this point, I appreciate the tactical need not to dump on the House staff draft to the point where the House staff says, well, if you don't like, we should go back to the NERC version since there is a group that  DOES support that version.  So we have to keep that in mind.  In short, we need to ""nurture"" the House staff draft for House markup purposes while keeping our options open to support the Bingaman language in the Senate and perhaps in conference, too.

3.	EPSA may be able to seek further improvements to the House staff draft.  As written, it gives FERC more jurisdiction than the NERC version, and less procedural hurdles -- but there are still some procedural hurdles, although one can argue of far less consequence than the NERC version.  Bingaman gives FERC more direct reliability jurisdiction than the House staff draft.  Specific issues are identified below.

4.	Specific Issues Spotted In House Staff Draft --

	a.	There is no definition of ""reliability"" and thus it is unclear what matters are within the jurisdiction of the ERO on which to develop standards and enforce them.  Perhaps there needs to be a sentence that says FERC can assign specific matters to them or otherwise define the EROs turf.  Would FERC have that ability without specific language?  Another option is to use the definition of ""organization standard"" in the NERC version which makes it clear that the subject matter is technical standards --  not a broader agenda under the guise of ""reliability.""

	b.	Unless I am mistaken, the House staff draft would allow FERC to certifiy more than one ERO.  This would be an odd result; by contrast, the NERC version makes it clear that if more than one entity applies, FERC picks one to be THE ERO (but then requires that single ERO to defer to regional reliability entities -- there is no such deference under the House staff draft).  On the other hand, if FERC can approve multiple EROs -- would this result in regional EROs? (perhaps one in the East and one in the West?)

	c.	There is an internal conflict in the House staff draft.  Part of it says FERC could assign the enforcement role of an ERO in a given region to an RTO.  But from the NERC-led discussions, PJM and others have pointed out the criteria for an ERO has ""independence"" language and other organizational criteria that an RTO could not meet (i.e., the ERO must be independent of users and owners and operators of the bulk power system under the House staff language).

	d.	Why does there need to be language saying proposed reliability rules go into effect after so many days if FERC does not act?  Like the NERC version, the House staff draft precludes FERC from directly amending standards (although there is language that says FERC can order the ERO to propose a standard, as there is in the NERC version.  Some say this should not be objectionable because as a practical matter this is the manner for FERC to amend proposed standards without offending Canada and Mexico.  Others see it as a needless hurdle. (The House draft has direct FERC amending authority on the rules by which the ERO operates -- but NOT on the reliability standards themselves.)

"RE: EISB and Enron","Thanks for the update.  It is disappointing that AGA is not opening the process, although the final EISB Retail Gas standards will need to be vetted by an ANSI group so we'll get our comments in one way or the other.

Also, what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocols across the board?  Seems like pushing NARUC to agree that this is the right vehicle makes sense.

Subject:	RE: EISB and Enron

Our UBP group met for two days last week in St. Louis, along with GISB and AGA reps.  UBP is definitely on board with creating the retail electric quadrant of an EISB.  We have been working extensively on getting the membership in line with a national organization.  Attached is a ""draft"" governance document that was completed at our meeting last month.  When this document was initiated, we were unsure of the progress to an EISB and it was developed to accommodate either a stand-alone retail organization until the EISB was formed or to be used as a part of the EISB organization.  AGA has been off on their own developing details for the retail Gas quadrant of EISB.  We have been very vocal in stating that they cannot develop these documents in a vacuum with only gas utility representation; they must reach out to Suppleirs, Services, etc.  The AGA member told us at our meeting that they plan to have an open meeting sometime in November to gain input.  We'll wait and see how that develops.  A Virginia SCC staff member is also working to get us some time in front of the Electricity Committee to update them on our progress and continue to foster their support of our endeavor.  Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Nancy, etal --

With the discussions at NERC recently to broaden their role, I think that we need to be very coordinated on our EISB message and begin to figure out how we get AGA to work with the Retail Gas and EEI/UBR to work with the Retail Power quadrants.  Let's think about a NARUC message to drive this very quickly (maybe at the next meeting).

Having one body begin to coordinate all of these matters will greatly expand our policy reach.

Subject:	EES Market

I met with Jim Woods to discuss reviewing the states that are open and taking a targeted approach to most efficiently leverage our resources towards tearing down barriers in states where we have a significant market opportunity with a value proposition.

Steve, to your question the other day as to how much market opportunity there is, what I gleaned from the meeting is that there are a number of opportunities that could take us through 2002, but after that it starts to dwindle unless we can mine deeper in states where we have been active.  However, the other interesting point is that EES does not have resources to necessarily determine where the value proposition is and is looking to us to present to them what we think might be markets that will work for them.  Thus, there may very well be more opportunities than they are currently focused on.  As preliminary step, Steve Montovano and I had talked about getting a document together that gives the high level summary of each state as a starting point.  Lynette Barnes has worked on such a document and Kathleen Sullivan is going to work with her further and get a draft to Steve and I for review and distribution to EES.  Jim was very interested in seeing such a document.  Jim also noted that a state that has opportunities in the first year, may not in the second, but could reemerge in the third.

Jim, Jim Wood also mentioned that he had talked to you about a more coordinated approach to EES and government affairs working together.  Jim and I are going to exchange lists of who is assigned to which states and then put together teams.  Steve Montovano and I will work on identifying the government affairs people for each state in our regions to give to Jim Woods.

It was agreed that over the next few weeks, I will put together a document that will try to preliminarily identify the states and more specifically the utilities where there may be opportunities for EES based on a number of issues.  The plan is to then share that with Jim Wood and then have a higher level meeting within EES to target where government affairs puts in its greatest efforts.  Once I have a draft, I will share it internally for comment before sending it on to Jim Woods.

Areas of interest to Jim were all of New England, Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.  Illinois is emerging as one of their best markets and they are also interested in looking real hard at Michigan.  

With respect to Michigan, I met with the Michigan EES team and it appears that from a product development standpoint, they will be ready to go at the beginning of 2002, but the commodity desk is saying 2004 due to uncertainty on the RTO front, although they conceded that if progress is made, we could move the date up.  There was also a discussion of doing financial deals in Michigan for the first years until we are comfortable going physical.

I will keep you posted as this progresses, but I am optimistic that this cooperative effort will lead to greater opportunities for EES.

We should intervene based on our potential interest in serving customers pursuant to AB661(short answer=Paul's language).  It is possible that we may want to reduce revenue requirements by recommending the use of financial products to minimize utility revenue risk. We have intervened in the AB 661 regulation proceeding as Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. If you think we can raise issues outside of ""unbundling"" we should limit our intervention to EES and EPMI.

We have intervened in certain cases where we may have an ongoing
commercial interest to require ""rate unbundling"" in anticipation of
direct access.  We also can intervene on behalf of EWS who may provide
risk mgt. products to reduce utility rates (i.e., weather derivitives to
stabilize rates and reduce utility-reated risk).  In this case we are
there to make sure rates are properly unbundled to facilitate AB 661.

By this e-mail, I'm forwarding this to Pat Keene.  He will be your main

filings for the sale of PGE.  My view is that it should be both ENA and
EES.  Our interest is:  (1) we are a potential new electric resource
under AB 661; and (2) these cases will influence whether we can serve
customers under the statute as the unbundled costs incurred by our
potential customers will be determined in this case.

Pat:  What do we say in other states where we intervene and there is no
direct access?  I'd rather not say that we that we are representing the
interests of several large consumers in Nevada.  It opens our deals up
for discovery.

I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.

California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento






CMTA PARTICIPATES IN GOVERNOR'S ECONOMIC SUMMIT 
Press Release 

Today at Governor Davis' Economic Summit at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, the California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA) proposed three recommendations to help bring immediate relief to the state's faltering economy. 

""California is in a dramatic economic decline,"" said CMTA President Jack M. Stewart.  ""Manufacturing employment is down 63,000 this year and by more than 10,000 jobs in September alone. The state's unemployment rate has risen steadily for the eight consecutive months, peaking at its present 5.4 percent."" 

""It's time for the state to implement new policies that will incent investment sooner rather than later,"" said Stewart. 

CMTA today will introduce proposals to: 

Implement a Sales Tax Exemption <http://www.cmta.net/press/salestax110201> ( <http://www.cmta.net/press/salestax110201>) on Manufacturing, Processing and Telecommunications Equipment 
Reduce Electricity Rates <http://www.cmta.net/press/electricrates110201> ( <http://www.cmta.net/press/electricrates110201>) and Provide Customer Choice in Energy 
Declare a Moratorium on New and Increased Regulatory Fees <http://www.cmta.net/press/stopfees110201> ( <http://www.cmta.net/press/stopfees110201>) and Taxes 

These initiatives will comprise the association's focus in the coming months, and were a collaborative effort among CMTA members. 

""The costs associated with a battered business community are not only measured by stock-tickers and cable financial networks.  They are the human toll of jobs that are lost, mortgages that fail and families that go with less,"" added Stewart.  ""These measures will restore confidence in every manufacturers' ability to remain productive and allow them to reinvest in the state's workforce."" 

California's manufacturing sector currently produces: 

80 percent of state exports 
One sixth of state payroll 
40 percent higher wages than the statewide average 
And for every manufacturing job, an additional 1-3 jobs are produced 

""These proposals are common sense ideas that will send a strong message to the largest and most important sector of our economy that the state will provide the critical relief they need to help themselves and help California through this economic crisis,"" concluded Stewart. 
  

BAY AREA VENTURE INVESTMENT FALLS 

According to just released data from Venture Economics and  the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), venture capital investment in the Bay Area during the 3rd quarter dropped 27 percent over the 2nd quarter of this year. Investment has slowed significantly this year and the 3rd quarter investment is 74 percent lower than the $9.3 billion high reached during the 2nd quarter of 2000. 

The Bay Area drop in investment nearly matched the national trend for the 3rd quarter. Venture capitalists invested $7.7 billion nationally during the quarter, down 31 percent from the previous quarter, and 73 percent from the $28.5 billion high of last year. 

""Although these are clearly difficult times for all business sectors, the venture industry will persevere. Veterans in our industry recognize this downturn as part of the long-term venture capital cycle. Real value can be created in down cycles by sticking with committed entrepreneurs with strong business models and the tenacity to see their ideas through,"" commented Mark Heesen, NVCA President. 
  

CMTA GETS VETO ON BILL RESTRICTING SICK LEAVE 

At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) and other employer organizations, Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB 1197 by Senator Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles). The bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child, parent or spouse in any absence control program 

Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child, parent, or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions.  The provision covers brief illnesses such as colds, high temperature, sore throats etc., that are more likely to be associated with children and is less likely to involve physician or hospital care.  However, employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions. 

When employees don't show up or show up late for work, it negatively impacts production.  In order to mitigate this problem, employers have implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling, suspension and termination.  After the above provision became law, employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision, so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse.  SB 1197 would have eliminated that option and could have forced employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem. 

In addition to insuring that production schedules are met, the main reason for an employer's absence policy is to provide a fair way to identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work as scheduled and/or on time.  Making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning.  For example, if an employee's attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays, Mondays and holiday weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for family member sick leave purposes, no disciplinary action could be taken. In other instances, it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late. 

SB 1197 would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the statute where an employer has an absence control policy.  Consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees.  CMTA discussed with legislators the counter-productive nature of restricting an employer's ability to manage a voluntarily provided benefit. When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations, it provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their sick leave program. 

CMTA believes that it would be poor public policy to protect those employees who have trouble getting to work under SB 1197 and could end up eliminating the benefit for all employees.  CMTA applauds Governor Davis's veto of the bill.

"RE: Conference call to discuss Enron Drop to POLR","Dan, etal --

Someone from CSC was on the call (Allison Hafner).  

TXU said the meters were to be read by Dec 13 with final EDI files sent to ERCOT by Dec 14.  ERCOT would process a REP of Record change on Dec 13.  

Looks like everything is ok.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Ashley -

We would prefer (given the schedules) to hold a conference call on Wednesday pm with a group of marketers/generators.  Seems like the easiest way to discuss with everyone.  It would be great to have a paper from NG earlier in the week.  

Here is our list of recommended people.  Probably best to have NG or you call to invite (rather than Enron) to highlight your interest in brokering a deal in the Midwest. 

Exelon 			(Jack Crowley)  	610 765 6612
Constellation 		(Harvey Reed)  	410 468 3480
Edison Mission Energy 	(Reem Fahey)  	312 583 6033
Reliant 			(John Orr)  	713 207 3490
Duke 				(Mike Gildea)	713 627 5529 or (Lee Barrett)  713 627 6519
Mirant 			(Jim Mayhew)  	478 579 3421

"CPUC Questions on DA Suspension","Jeremy --

To let you know where we stand on the CPUC's Investigation on DA Suspension.  

1.	Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.

2.	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.

3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.

4.	At this time, Enron will file as a member of AReM.  We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.

If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.

It would be great if we could meet on Wednesday, Sept. 5th.  
 
On Friday, Sept. 7th the electric restructuring oversight committee is holding an interim legislative hearing regarding ERCOT/market issues.  Invited testimony only; invited to testify are ERCOT and the Chairman of the PUC.  On Thursday, we are having a pre-hearing meeting with Rep. Wolens and Senator Sibley to brief them on the issues we would like addressed at the hearing on Friday.  
 
First, could everyone please forward a list of the issues that you are working on in Texas?  Second, are there any specific issues or questions you would like to have legislators ask of ERCOT or PUC Chairman?  Could I have both of these lists by Tuesday.  If I can get this information from you, the briefing of legislators will be more meaningful which will make the hearing more meaningful.    
 
Please let me know if you can meet on Wednesday.  Thanks, Jean

If ok with all of you, I'll have my assistant set it up early Sept.

However, in answer to your questions:

1.	You cannot transfer an L1 visa to another company, as it is Enron specific.
2.	You can stay in the US for a short time to pack up and move things.   You cannot stay indefintely, as you will be out of status.
3.	If your wife gets a working visa, then she will be able to stay legally, but I imagine you would then be her dependent.
4.	Alternatively, you can look for a job and get an HIB visa for yourself and and H4 visa for your wife (she still cannot work on an H4 visa). 

Once we know more about what is going on, everyone will have a better understanding of what advice to give to visa holders.

I will assume two hours of my time for testimony review and about four hours for Rob Kinas to fly up to Reno and back (I realize this is generous, but I don't know the place schedule or whether he can do any useful work in transit, so I thought I would give you worst case).  That's probably about $1,600 plus expenses.  You could knock off at least two hours if Rob can admit you from the Las Vegas office of the Commission.  Usually the PUCN allows parties to participate via teleconference in Las Vegas if the hearing is in Carson City and vice versa.  It would also save you the airfare and car rental (its cheaper than a cab even if you are only staying in Carson City a short while) for Rob.  However, I urge you and your witness to appear live in Carson City.

P.S.  When did Enron become such a tightwad?

October 15, 2001
Vol. 3, No. 19

The $45 Million Rip Off

Running back Ricky Walters, a native of Harrisburg, once responded to a question about why he did not lay his body on the line to catch a ball over the middle by saying, ""For who? For what?"" Residential and business customers in the Duquesne Light service territory should also cry, ""For who? For what?"" to the news that, starting in January 2002 when Duquesne Light joins PJM West, they will be charged $45 million per year to meet PJM West's new capacity requirement called ACAP, the close relative of the rogue PJM ICAP rule.

Actually, in this instance, ""for who"" is clear. PJM and Orion are the parties for whom customers will pony up $45 million, or $32.40 per year for a 600 kWh monthly customer. Orion is charging $44 per MW-day for capacity, the equivalent of 0.45 cents per kWh. The cash goes into Orion's pocket and is a windfall for a ""product"" that typically has a marginal cost of zero (see the affidavit of Professor Peter Cramton, filed with FERC on behalf of the New England Independent System Operator, who properly concluded that ICAP should be scrapped). But the windfall to Orion is delivered courtesy of the PJM Independent System Operator that stubbornly clings to its failed ICAP market and won't  replace it with forward operating reserve markets and requirements.

The real mystery is, ""for what"" will customers be paying $45 million? Has anyone shown that Duquesne's reliability record has been unsatisfactory? Has PJM demonstrated that the $45 million would reduce Duquesne's loss of load probability? There are no good answers to those questions. ICAP/ACAP remain the biggest consumer rip-off in the wholesale market. It's past time for FERC, public utility commissions, and especially the offices of consumer advocate to insist on their abolition and replacement.

A few things must be remembered about ICAP:

Along with the huge ECAR region, an area twice the size of PJM, the Duquesne Light Control Area prior to January 2002 had no ACAP or ICAP rules. And yet for the last 30 years the lights have stayed on in Pittsburgh as well as or better than in PJM. Even when PJM had rolling blackouts on January 19, 1994, the Duquesne control area continued to provide reliable power.

So what will the $45 million buy consumers? More reliability? No. ACAP won't increase the Duquesne control area's historic level of reliability. And even if it would, why is it necessary? Reliability in the Duquesne control area has been excellent. In fact, Duquesne and the rest of the ECAR area ensure reliability through different, equally effective but lower-cost reliability rules.

The Current ECAR Model
The ECAR model could be summarized by the phrase ""pay only for what you need."" The current reliability mechanism is met through purchasing 4 percent operating reserves. These are made up of Load and Frequency Regulating (Spinning) Reserves (1 percent) and Contingency Reserves of 3 percent divided into 1.5 percent of contingency Spinning Reserves and 1.5 percent of Contingency Supplemental Reserves. These reserves margins have served western Pennsylvanians well, resulting in reliable service equal to - and in some cases exceeding - PJM.

Reserve payments compensate only those units that are not operating at the time but have the capability of generating in less than 10 minutes. The cost for these reserves is not easily calculated due to lack of a transparent market. Yet they appear to be approximately less than $2/MW-day during on-peak periods and often less than $1/MW-day. This would result in costs of less than $1.15/MW-day based on the Allegheny Power peak load. The cost for a typical residential customer would be .012 cents per kWh.

The Current PJM Model
The PJM model could similarly be described as, ""pay for everything and still pay extra for what you need."" Generators receive three payments, the reserve payments mentioned above, a capacity payment, and an energy payment. PJM, like ECAR, has a need for operating reserves and purchases these in order to maintain reliability. Additionally, the PJM model provides an Unforced Capacity payment to all generators based on their historical performance. Generators receive this payment whether or not they are able to operate on a particular day or are already being compensated for providing electricity. PJM currently compensates generators based on a 19 percent reserve margin. The overall cost of ICAP has varied considerably over the three years of competition. The average since 1999 has been $78.74/MW-day. This results in overall costs of over $1.6 billion per year. Residential customers have experienced ICAP costs ranging from about 0.4 to 1.8 cents per kWh. Moreover, on top of ICAP, a PJM customer must purchase additional spinning reserves costing approximately the same as the reserves in ECAR.

Ending the Rip-off
PJM should move to a reserve-based reliability methodology similar to ECAR. An Operating Reserve-based methodology used in tandem with PJM's competitive electricity market will furnish the same level of reliability but at greatly reduced prices. This methodology should pay for those products that are really needed - excess reserves to be used during peak demand periods. A strong forward energy and operating reserve market can send the right price signals to build new generation - a fact that is readily apparent as we look to the Mid-west where thousands of megawatts of new generation have been built in response to clear price signals over the past few years.

All this tells us that ICAP has its self-interested defenders but no justification for raiding consumers' wallets.

Subject: Items for discussion - Price Risk Management


Lisa:
 
When we meet later today to discuss the price risk management project, I would like to address the following:
 
1. Should the matrix Masha and I put together of exisiting hedging activity go out to the group (Sue and I had talked about this at one point)?  Attached is the most recent matrix.
 
2. In my absence, who (if anyone) should take over the responsibility of keeping the matrix updated?  If it is someone here, it may be helpful for me to sit down with that person to let them know what I consider to be the best sources of info.
 
3. I have a lot of files organized by state of dockets, etc.  Who should these be passed on to?
 
Thanks, 
 
Jennifer

Please forward this e-mail  to colleagues in other departments who might be interested in  participating. Sign up by replying to this e-mail with the appropriate  information completed below.   ""Creating a Vibrant Retail Electricity Market""   Tuesday, October 30, 2001, at 10 am (MST), 12 noon  (EST)  What key findings have  marketing practitioners and restructuring architects gleaned from retail  energy markets that have opened to date? If currently closed markets are  to open successfully, what critical elements must be in place? Which  stumbling blocks need to be removed? E Source has convened a panel of  experienced players to distill what can be learned from recently opened  markets and offer advice for incorporating these lessons into your  strategic and marketing planning. The panel will  include:   [IMAGE]       Karen O'Neill, Vice  President of New Markets, Green Mountain  Energy               [IMAGE]       John Hanger, CEO of  Penn Future and former Commissioner with the Pennsylvania Public  Utility Commission               [IMAGE]       Joe Douglas, Marketing  Manager with npower direct, one of the largest retail energy  suppliers in the United Kingdom                ""Is it  Possible to Restructure Retail Electric Markets?"" Tuesday, November 6,  2001, at 10 am (MST), 12 Noon (EST)  The catastrophic failure of  California's restructuring efforts, coupled with extremely low switching  rates in overseas and various U.S. state markets, raises anew the debate  over whether it is even possible to restructure retail electric markets.  Is there something fundamentally different about electric markets that  render them impossible to open? Over the past quarter-century, numerous  once-regulated industries, such as financial services, airlines, and  telecommunications, have been successfully restructured. Why is  electricity an outlier? Will it change?  Two distinguished industry  analysts, Ken Malloy, CEO of  the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets and publisher of the RED  Index, and Dr. Mark Cooper,  Director of Research for Consumer Federation of America, will debate two  interrelated propositions:   1. All retail customers  should be required to choose a new energy supplier.  2. Non-commodity  products--such as demand-side management, distributed generation, green  power, and combined heat and power--will penetrate faster and more deeply  in open retail markets than they would under the continuation of  traditional regulation.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

The Utilities continue push for a ""hard"" deadline of DA.  They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.  Of course, in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have DA service if the customer's name was not on our Oct 5 Customer List.

Subject:	Fuel Cells

Did Connecticut reject our fuel cell project? If so, details?
[Allegretti, Daniel]  

Yes.  The DPUC issued a draft decision which declines to fund the project from the Conservation and Load Management Fund.  The decision praises the project in the text but includes a footnote which is critical of the project.  In addition, the DPUC issued a press release which is not helpful in promoting the project.

The decision not to fund out of the C&LM fund was not unexpected.  The chairman of the DPUC has been very supportive, along with Governor Rowland, but has been working offline to fund the project instead from the Renewable Energy Investment Fund.  Although the REIF is a much smaller fund it appears the REIF is able to borrow against future receipts and is willing to do so based in part on their expectation of increased funding next legislative session.  We are meeting with the REIF director next Wednesday to confirm where this stands.

In the mean time we have filed exceptions to the draft decision which goes final tomorrow.  We are told that the offending footnote will be removed but that the decision not to commit the C&LM fund will remain unchanged.

In sum, the project has suffered a very real setback but has not at this time been abandoned by EPMI.  Support from Rowland and others remains strong and EPMI would like to see if funding from the REIF this year is in fact viable.

What's the upside and downside from the Settlement.  My only concern is that FERC is so swamped with issues may be overwhelming.  Where is our business going?

FYI.  Obviously, we would want to participate in any settlement discussions.  Do you see any reason why we would not want to support the motion to establish the settlement procedure?  SRP indicates that the ongoing proceedings would not be delayed.

Subject:	Motion To Convene Settlement Conference

Attached is a draft motion of Salt River Project to establish a date certain
for convening a settlement conference under Rule 602, in accordance with the
settlement package distributed on July 30. Paragraph 8 of the motion will
list all parties that are in support of this procedural motion.  A company's
support for the motion IN NO WAY reflects any agreement to support any
setttlement proposal.  It merely indicates a desire to initiate a parallel
settlement path without interfering with or delaying FERC's processing of
the ongoing proceedings. Please reply to all by COB Tuesday in advising
whether your company would like to be listed.  We intend to file on
Wednesday early afternoon.  Thank you.

The major increases are for salaries, consultants in the regulatory, public affairs and environmental areas, legislative advertising and a senior executive meeting in the Spring.  Assuming the budget is approved, I am planning to recommend raising the current cap on Board member dues of $150,000 to $175,00, a 17% increase.  Is that something you can live with?

Ginger - Please forward to Gov't Affairs group.  Thanks!

We're trying to identify information needs - both specific and general.  Many of these are already provided, and response to this survey will help in identifying new services and prioritizing/improving existing offerings.  Depending on the response to each offering, most will likely be made available.  For this effort, please rank up to five choices in the list below (1=highest).  We'll tally the results, identify which items will have priority and communicate back how those needs will direct implementation efforts.  Please note that items marked with (*) would require your input.  Please click on Forward for this message to allow you to type in your ranking numbers, and send the response to Rita Hartfield by Wednesday, October 17.

Good news.

Jim,
	I know that your group is following the RTO - ISO issues in Washington and wanted to know if we could be added to your distribution list on these updates?  Also, if there is anything we could help you with on this issue we would happy to do so.  We are also looking at FERC and their short list for the 5th appointee.  As you know, it is still very preliminary, but as soon as we get more information we will pass it on.  Hope all is going well and let me know if there is anything else we can do.

Thanks,
Kristin

Thanks, Jim. If you conclude that you think this is promising, I'd suggest
you talk to some of our current sponsors to see if we're for real. The
corporate types like ATT or the Manufacturers Association would be the best
fit, but you can talk to anybody you want to. I also understand how unusual
this is, I'm used to being asked to prove myself to prospective clients, and
willing to do so with you. I want to work with you folks and I'm willing to
go the extra mile to do so.

What's your timeline on this?

   Subject:  disruptive technology, short and simple and confidential


   We produce political/public affairs television programs which air in
   state capitols. Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio, expanding
   into NJ, Md and DE. The disruptive technology is this: the real target
   of the TV show is the guest, not the audience. Lobbyists have trouble
   scheduling time with politicians and regulators, and when they get on
   the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from
   government decision makers. We don't have trouble with either. Every
   politician and appointee wants to be on television, they always say yes.
   When they ask us what the topics will be, and we mention something like
   telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want
   briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on
   television. In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television
   commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them.

   In short:

   Step one: identify gov't decision makers that our sponsors want to
   influence
   Step two: invite them on the program and, in doing so, develop rapport
   with their key staff members on the relevant issues
   Step three: send briefing materials and/or give a briefing in person
   before the the taping
   Step four: towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely
   been bragging about his/her policy agenda
   Step five: steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics, framing
   the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to
   resist the conclusions suggested by the host.
   Step six: take the statement of support for the position we favor e.g.
   tort reform, privatization, deregulation, tax cuts, etc. (which by the
   way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air) and in
   addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show, we
   digitize it and send it out to legislators, regulators and the proper
   beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker
   to back off later.

   Current sponsors: Medical Society, Hospital Association, State System of
   Higher Education, Manufacturers Association, Cornell Corrections, AT&T.
   Levels: 25K, 50K, 100K per year for Pa; 15k for Ohio (one level only).

   This is an amazingly simple, elegant and direct way to influence policy
   makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energy-oriented firms
   in partnership with us. Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit.

   I'll be in touch,

   p.s. Sponsorship can be done in ways that are not visible if you prefer,
   via intermediaries, if you are publicity shy.

The next meeting of the CAEM Board of Directors will be held on Wednesday,
September 12, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, DC.

The meeting is being held in conjunction with the third meeting of our DISCO
of the Future Forum. (Please visit our newly updated website www.caem.org
for more information on the DISCO Forum.) Following the Board meeting on
Wednesday, you are invited to join with members of the DISCO Forum for a
Wednesday evening reception and dinner, including a guest speaker. Board
members are also invited to join in the substantive session of the DISCO
Forum on Thursday, September 13.

Because of an international medical convention ongoing in Washington at the
same time as our meetings, the Grand Hyatt unfortunately is already booked.
However, we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel. To
reserve one of these rooms, you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are
part of the CAEM group. If you should decide to arrange lodging at a
different hotel, please do so quickly as there is limited availability in
all surrounding hotels. We will be making the Wyndham rooms available to
members of the DISCO Forum on July 20.

If you have any questions or require any assistance at all, please contact
Hope Duncan at 202.739.0134 or Jeff Mangold at 703.729.2710. We are looking
forward to seeing you on September 12.

Subject:	Going Forward California Costs - Future Revenue Reqts

I wanted to make sure that everyone is on the same page related to utility costs in California.  These costs may be (will be?) collected  from some utility customer, potentially including direct access customers.


Bucket #1	Utility Undercollection Feb 1, 2000 Through Jan 18, 2001

About $12.0 Billion (this money includes our Negative CTC amounts).  Should be financed through corporate debt.  No securitization.

Enron's Position:	Bundled service on Jan 1, 2001 pays fixed c/kwh

Bucket #2	CDWR Cost from Jan 5, 2001 through Bond Issuance or March 31, 2002

About $12.5 Billion  (about $10 Billion for spot purchases and $2.5 Billion for long-term buys)

Enron's Position:	Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) for all residential and small customers.  Larger customers are assigned direct responsibility for the Undercollection on c/kwh.  Balancing account for holding Utility even.  

Bucket #3	Prospective Generation Costs for Bundled Service Post March 31, 2002

URG 	= $40/mwh (retained generation and bilateral contracts)
CDWR 	= $120/mwh
QF 	= $100/mwh  

TOTAL 	= URG*%sales + CDWR*%sales + QF*%sales
	= $90/mwh


Bucket #4	AB1890 Non-Generation Stranded Costs

"RE: RTO Week Comments","My thoughts --

1.	Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for Enron because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).  Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.
2.	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.
3.	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.
4.	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.  Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.  The electric market needs transmission to be ""rationalized"" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.
5.	Should we attack the 209 Boards?  Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	RTO Week Comments

Comments on FERC's RTO Week are due on November 3 (Saturday) so we would like to submit comments by the end of this week.  Some of us have briefly discussed the types of comments we may want to submit on behalf of Enron, and the attached list of ""Talking Points"" are issues that Christi and I put together for Rick during his Washington meetings last week.  These talking points focus on issues that were raised during RTO Week by panelists that we may want to address -- either because the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  We will use the talking points as an outline on issues to raise in our comments.  

We also want to state up front in the comments that FERC is on the right track and that FERC has done a lot of analysis and studies to determine that ""right sized"" RTOs are in the public interest (this is in response to the negative comments made by the state commissioners that FERC is taking action that has not been proven to be beneficial to consumers).  We also want to make the point that RTO creation is not about retail access and does not impact whether or not a state offers retail choice.

Also attached is a link to FERC Staff's notes from RTO Week.  I have not reviewed these notes yet, but we may also want to respond to these notes in our comments using the same criteria as above; i.e., on areas where we feel that the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  

Please review the Talking Points paper and the Staff Notes, and let me know what you think about this strategy.  I am writing the comments and welcome all help and input.  

I hope to keep these comments limited (10 pages or so), so we need to stay focused -- raise the issue, make our point, and move on.  

Thanks Everyone

Sarah

Can you please work with ENA Accounting and others to determine the following to provide to EPSA so they can calculate our Dues --

1.	Total megawatts of your company's equity ownership as of June 1, 2001 in competitive generation assets operating and under construction in the United States (including PURPA plants) - (probably good to start with Wes Coldwell).

2.	Total megawatthours of market-priced wholesale and retail sales for the 12 months ending March 31, 2001 (probably just get Linda Lawrence to sum up our monthly sales (I would have a separate total for wholesale financials) and use someone from Evan Hughes shop for physical retail sales).

Call me to discuss.  We need to get this in by August 18.

"RE: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE -- Calif analysis","Steve --
 
Thanks.  Looks good.  Some thoughts for you to consider:
 
1.    Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present.  No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation).  I think that Impact #2 better captures the idea.  Also, probably not good to use the term ""CTC Eliminated"".  Maybe should say ""CTC = 0 c/kwh"".  Given the CPUC's March 27 Order, the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31, 2002.
 
2.     In calculating Impact #2, what did you use as the Jan 19 - Aug baseline?  Did you calculate the hit of ($104.5) from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model (there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline)?  Also, I assume that the Feb - Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service.
 
3.    Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG&E Adjustment.  Also, may be interesting to have the $ impact of the PG&E Adjustment (the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake).  I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly.
 
4.    Should Impact #4 and Impact #5 apply to SCE's loads?  In column 4 it looks like it does.  SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge.
 
5.    Probably better to model Impact #5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1.
 
6.    Can you break out the volumes for ""vintage"" contracts versus ""retail gen with passthru"" contracts?  You haven't shown anything for (a) Utility Undercollection costs or (b) CDWR bond fees.  These costs may hit our vintage contracts.

The attached file is the latest version, go to SUMMARY page.  I still have some finalizing to do on the format/info to present, would appreciate comments, feedback, etc.  As you will see, we have veered some from our initial task of looking at ""SCE"" and ""PG&E"" method, mainly b/c I have come to believe, based on info from Sue Mara and other sources, that SCE does not intend to eliminate the CTC -- they have merely stopped calculating it for now until they can get some guidance from CPUC.  Nevertheless, if the CTC were to be eliminated, the impact is shown in the model summary.

Subject: Tariff changes effective October 22, 2001


The following notice was posted on the Nominations Electronic Bulletin
Board today:


On October 12, 2001 the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved
Columbia's tariff filing to become effective on October 22, 2001, subject
to an Administrative Law Judge Recommendation.  This tariff filing includes
several changes that may be important to suppliers, such as changes in
Columbia's banking and balancing service, introduction of a new Flow Order
Management Service, and a new Imbalance Trading Service.

The full text of Columbia's original tariff proposals, as filed with the PA
Public Utility Commission on August 22, 2001, can be accessed at the
following site:

                                     h
ttp://www.columbiagaspamd.com/products_services/tariff_revisions_effective_oct.htm

Shippers serving aggregation pools on the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania,
Inc. system should carefully review Columbia's new Elective Balancing
Service (proposed tariff pages 164 - 169) and choose one of the three
balancing service options for each aggregation pool.  Also, suppliers who
have been designated as an authorized agent for non-aggregated customers
may choose an elective balancing option on behalf of those customers.
Columbia's current estimated rate for Option 1, Full Balancing Service, is
as follows:

SGS, SDS Customers  $0.20/Mcf
LDS, MLS  Customers $0.10/Mcf

Please note that Columbia's interruptible banking and balancing service
will no longer be available.  The cost for the interruptible service
($0.1109/Mcf for SGS and SDS, and $0.0358 for LDS and MLS) will be removed
from customers' distribution rates when the new Elective Balancing Services
become effective.

Under the newly approved Elective Balancing Service (Rider EBS), customers
or their authorized agents are given 20 days in which to elect their
service option.  Customers or their authorized agents who do not elect one
of the three Elective Balancing Service options on or before November 12,
2001 will default to Option 1, Full Balancing Service.  Columbia will post
final rates for Rider EBS Option 1 by the close of business on November 15,
2001.  If the final rates exceed the above estimated rates by more than
20%, customers or their authorized agents who have elected Option 1 may
change their election by submitting a change to Columbia in writing  by the
close of business on November 20, 2001.  Columbia will begin providing
service under the elected option as of December 1, 2001.

A form for the election of Rider EBS options will be e-mailed to the
""notices"" contact person for each supplier that is active on the Columbia
Gas of Pennsylvania systemwhen it is available.

Please contact your Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc. representative at
412-572-7117 with any questions relating to these new services.


Attached are the forms and a brief outline of the changes.

FYI.  Note that we even had a meeting which included EES on 9/5 where the responsible party (Kelly Lovvorn) committed to certain tasks, which he obviously did not perform.  (Kelly is a contract employee.)  

Jim - there will be a charge (probably significant, especially for the ""emergency"" processing) from CSC to produce the required information.  There is some expectation that Government Affairs should be paying for it, especially since it will be a recurring item for several months.  Who should I go to to resolve this?

Unfortunately, no action was ever taken nor followed through on this request originally initiated 8/14/01, which has now

and CSC.

We're in the process of writing system specifications and will forward an ""emergency"" request for data to Brenda and CSC
this afternoon.   

Becky Cantrell will submit a request for an extension to FERC as soon as we determine how quickly CSC can produce the
information required.

Please note, no further action from any other group will be required.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Suzanne,

Please be advised that Kelly Lovvorn (x5-8997) will coordinate the FERC data requirements with IT personnel for the EES Systems.
I passed on all the details regarding data specifications and a high level overview of ENAs plan.

The EES data will need to be pulled from all Settlement applications which include HP9000, STAT, and Altra.  Kelly does
have a few programming resources available in house, yet he may need to request the information from CSC.  If that is the
case, there will be costs associated with the data pull and it will be much more difficult to validate the data.  In addition, there
may also be timing issues (????)....

I have asked Kelly to coordinate directly with you as he has questions/concerns.  You may want to check back with him in a few days to
workout target dates for your team to actually receive the information, who he should forward info to, etc...

Thanks,

dg

(note:  Just as an ""extra"" thought....as long as we Settle out of Altra/HP/Stat, all FERC data 
 requests (involving pricing w/ volumetric actuals) will need to come from those systems.)

Subject:	CGE Gas Rate Case

Fyi...

CIncinnati Gas and Electric Company has filed for a $700 million rate increase which is enormous given the size of their company.  They are claiming that they need to replace their current low pressure gas system with a high pressure gas system and are looking to amortize the costs over ten years as opposed to the usual twenty years.  They plan to allocate the cost of this primarily through doubling the customer charge.  One of theories behind this rate increase is that Cinery wants to expand its business as an Exempt Wholesale Generator by building more gas fired turbines and it needs the high pressure gas to serve those turbines.  The concern therefore is whether captive ratepayers might be cross-subsidizing a competitive activity.

Subject:	Re: ERCOT - Problems with the New Market

We do need a formal plan.  We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions. Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.  We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.  Grand-standing is ignored.  Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored.  Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.   

Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations.  Thane and I also visited with him. 

Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed.  (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)  

Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments.  We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.  There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.  The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.  Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel.  The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.  Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.   

Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone.  I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet? Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.  I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then?  You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft.  Thanks, Jean

Subject:	ERCOT - Problems with the New Market

Jean & Thane --

Walking out last night, Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets.  

Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes.  

If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood.  As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market.  Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.

Jean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation.  I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am.  I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick's budget meeting.

Charles, Jose, Jim, and Rick, 

I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC.  Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the ""new sector weighted voting model"" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?

Andy



Gordon,

When did the ESC vote to adopt the  ""new sector weighted voting model?""  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?

Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  

Of course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don't think NERC can just ""annex"" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.  

Other members of the ESC - do you share this concern?

Dear ESC,

Attached are two documents from the recent NERC BOT meeting: 1.  Board

I don't need any elaborate research, as this is only for some estimates in current position values for origination purposes.  The month and year of estimated dereg will do.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Introducing a product that lets New York customers turn their 
energy load flexibility into a revenue opportunity.

Enron can turn energy usage flexibility into revenue for our customers. When a customer chooses Enron's product, 
they receive monthly payments in exchange for reducing their energy usage at Enron's request. Requests are made 
when energy market prices are high, so the energy the customer doesn't use can be sold on the market at a premium. 
Bad time for the customer? No problem--they can choose not to reduce usage, and pay a 
""buy through price"" to Enron instead. Want to learn more? Click here .

Jim.

Our margin will not evaporate.  I am trying to determine if it will take a modest hit since I do not know whether they based their assumptions on the higher or more moderate shopping credit that we could get in subsequent years.  When I have an answer to that, I will let you know.  There is no other solution to restructure the retail martket at this time since this is the result of the settlement and to date, FE has more activity than any other service territory - the issue in my mind is what percent is affiliate.  Moreover, my expectation level that the PUCO will do anything of value for the market is rather low.  Because the value proposition without the MSG is pretty poor and there is no more MSG, FE is a low priority for further action and EWS is not focusing their time there.  If it were higher on the list, the same issues of imbalance risk would apply.

FirstEnergy has made a filing with regard to the shopping credit for next year.  In that filing they are claiming that they have reached 20% switching and therefore do not need to increase the percentage spread between the price we buy the MSG at and the shopping credit.  I have been working with Scott Reneicke and Nicole Schwartz and am planning to file an intervention on behalf of Enron and contest the calculation of the 20% (which includes affiliate transactions) and the argument to not increase the percentage spread and any other arguments Scott may identify. 

Given circumstances, I am assuming that since this is something I can handle, I should do so as opposed to involving outside counsel.

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Subject:	RCR for MD gas comments

Follow-up on the RCR for MD gas comments discussed last Monday -
 
The Commission has asked for legal briefs on whether they have the authority to order or authorize a utility to stop providing sales service.  Enron had earlier filed a one paragraph statement (as part of a gas roundtable) that said utilities should obtain default service supply from competitive suppliers.

At this point, Janine and I agreed we should: 
1) file reply comments, not initial comments
2) in reply comments, agree with parties that say the Commission does have the authority (such parties will most likely include BGE and others), but caution that if the Commission were to allow or cause this to happen, they should be careful to structure default supply in a way that does not force marketers to take on unwanted roles, generally does not cause market chaos, and does not simply lock up the total market for a utility affiliate.

(The Commission's real motivation here may be to keep BGE in the role of default supplier.  For now, our gas desk also would like to see them stay in that role.  The likely winner of an eventual bidding process is BGE Home or WGL Energy Services, and they already dominate the competitive market.)

The RCR amount should stay at $2k.

There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

Nancy and Thane,

Thanks for sending this email.  We are in the process of evaluating our appetite for business in SWEPCO and GSU.  We do have load in both of these areas (non in WTU).  The load in SWEPCO is likely to go away in a negotiation process with Rexam.  However, we are running some numbers based on our curves and the prevailing tariff for a normal load shape customer in GSU and SWEPCO.  We are looking at possible negotiating with these utilities to purchase their 15% at reasonable prices so as not to hurt them with a low price to beat and have large stranded costs in the process.  I think the sooner Enron can participate in these markets ahead of competition, the more value there is to take advantage of.  I will let you know what our analysis indicates.  Thanks again for your email.

Subject:	Physical Delivery in SPP

The Staff of the PUCT has filed a petition to determine whether the market institutions and participants are ready for competition in the Texas portion of SPP (SERC), namely Entergy Gulf States, SWEPCO,  and WTU power regions, copies attached.  Staff has also requested the PUCT to suspend the capacity auction for Entergy and SWEPCO but not for WTU.  The petition requests the PUCT to make the determination at the November 1, 2001, meeting and to suspend the capacity auction at the August 23, 2001, meeting.

In support of their petition, staff argues that there has been limited participation in the SERC region, based on an ""informal survey"" of the staff.  Staff also explains that the FERC has not yet approved a RTO for the SERC region (SPP).  Staff is concerned that if auction of capacity results in a low price, this will have a detrimental effect of the affiliated REPs headroom under the price to beat determination as it is all tied to the price of capacity at the auction.  In addition, staff is concerned if Entergy or SWEPCO sells 15% of their capacity and are required to serve 100% of their load.  The staff has not requested a delay in the WTU capacity auction due to the fact that the WTU capacity is located in ERCOT and WTU's relatively small load. 

In order to prepare for filing comments, if neccessary, Enron Government Affairs would like to know the following:
1)  Does EES/EWS have signed contracts for physical delivery in Entergy, SWEPCO or  WTU?
2)  What amount of load do we have contracted in each utility within SPP?
3)  It appears that SPP will not open and no RTO will be in place on 1/1/02.  Therefore, is EWS prepared to operate in SPP under the existing control area structure?

Please forward your responses to Thane Twiggs and myself.  Also, please feel free to contact either of us if you have any questions.  Thanks.

"RE: One RTO Coalition Drafts","My comments --

I assume that in the Enron filing we will make a stronger argument for sticking with the 12-15-02 date?  Also, critical to highlight that the FERC should have one ""major"" change date, not multiple given the liquidity problems with significant regulatory change.

Finally, break out competitive retailers in the list of the ONE RTO Coalition. Every state inside this region (except VT) has competitive retail access.  Furthering this effort with further the policy directions of the states by lowering wholesale prices and making business ""easier"" for companies like EES.  We should play this up.  We are really pushing hard on the physical retail gen side in NYC and Boston and taking another look at PA and MD - this is the real benefit - that consumers' bills go down.

Rick, Jim and Susan:

Enclosed is the One RTO draft comments on the Northeast Mediation.  We would like to include Enron as a signatory party to the comments, so please read them to make sure that you are okay with us signing on.  Although the date issue is somewhat amorphous (we support PJM (with a Nov 2003 date but we also urge implementation as soon as possible -- Dec 2002 if possible).  

This was the best we could get the Coalition to agree to -- there are many parties who strenuously opposed advocating any date early than Nov 2003 and I had to threaten to take our name off the comments if we didn't say something about an earlier date.  We have not given final signoff, but they would like to hear from us by the end of the day (comments are due tomorrow).

Susan, please show the comments to Kevin, Dana, Paul (and anyone else who would like to see them).  We are also writing our own comments, which we will circulate by COB today for filing tomorrow.  They do not need to read the affidavits -- just the comments to make sure we're not saying anything they disagree with.

Also attached is the Henning affidavit that supports the Mirant study.  Although Mirant probably did not make the best choice in using an internal regulatory person to do the study presentation at FERC, everyone who I have talked to thinks that FERC staff reacted favorably to the study's findings.  One person overheard FERC staff say that they expected $440 million in savings per year, and they weren't questioning these savings, but wondered if these were enough savings to justify a movement to one RTO.  It seems to me that $440 million is significant savings, but who knows.  Anyway, we need to discuss whether we want to join in the Mirant Midwest study.  Provided that a similar study can be conducted in the midwest (since there are no ISOs there), with a similar good outcome, I think we should consider supporting the Mirant effort.

Please let me know what you think.  Thanks

Gloria, Jim and Harry;

Thanks for pulling us all together on Monday. We look forward to working with your group on merging the State Licensing and Utility Agreements into a common area, in order to keep the organization informed and up to date.

I wanted to re-cap just a bit.  The Services Group has state licensing responsibility for Gas and Power for EESI and EEMC. We handle new licensing and renewals.  We are on an ""auto-reminder"" distribution from EES legal, Heather Mathis for renewals/reporting.  We physically house all documentation relating to licensing on our floor. We currently publish and distribute as needed State License status report which identifies where we are licensed and what our license # is.  The Services Group works directly with Gloria for utility agreements, as we are one of many groups who she obtains sign-off from and/or information in order to execute agreements and State Licensing information is critical to her processes.

Gloria and I met yesterday to discuss next steps.  We are working together to provide the following.

1) Matrix of Executed Agreements which includes: State, License #, UDC, Agreement Type, Signatory, Date Issued, Expiration/Renewal, Security Requirements. (2 Weeks)
2) Backfill each groups need for documentation - provide copies of State Licenses and/or UDC agreements. (2 Weeks)
3) Identify the EES/ENE contacts sent to the State/UDC, update as needed, internally and externally. (2 - 3 Weeks)
4) Provide Summary information regarding State/UDC that can be placed on EES Market Central (2-3 Weeks?)
5) Ensure information is updated, published, organized and accessible to all interested parties. - Gloria has initiated creating binders that will be housed on the 47th floor - we will encompass State information with the executed UDC agreements. 

Gloria, please feel free to add anything I have overlooked.  I've attached the contact list currently used when obtaining State Licenses. This should help identify other stakeholders who you may want to speak with.

 << File: List of Contacts.doc >> 

Regards,
Rebecca

Subject:	An interesting point in time in the CA proceeding

Here is a snapshot of what is going on right now.  It is unusual.

According to ISO, they owe us $1MM (instead of us owing them $37MM)!!!!!
However, don't take this to the bank since Jan Acton of Charles River Associates believes that the ISO made a significant ""coding"" (ie mathematical formula) error with respect to uninstructed energy, that is behind most of this shift.  On the conference call held Monday, others also noticed discrepancies in the uninstructed energy category so it is likely the ISO will discover and fix the error.
We suspect there is game playing going on (in addition to errors in the data).  CERS went from having to refund $1.2billion, to zero.  Also, significant increases (unexplained) in neutrality charges have been observed. 
ISO asserts their calculations are correct despite the suspected errors and game playing.  However, they have not taken mitigation into account for ""spot OOM"" transactions.  The magnitude of this is unknown, but could be very large.  This makes the correctness of their data even more suspect.
Obviously, given the foregoing no one can agree to limit the scope of the proceeding through a stipulation excluding settlement disputes from the proceeding.  The numbers are huge as are the shifts or swings in liability with each iteration of new ISO numbers.
Absent agreement on the stipulation, Judge Birchman is scheduled to hear oral argument and decide the issue tomorrow.
Our main concern will be to keep consideration of issues 2 and 3 (refunds and offsets) together in the procedural schedule.

I am meeting with Dan Watkiss at noon to discuss strategy, and Gary Fergus will also be coming in for the hearing.  Another conference call with the ISO regarding their data will take place at 2PM.  I will follow up with another e-mail so as to keep you posted.

"Texas Market Issues","Thanks for the informative phone call this morning.  Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.

To follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.

1.	December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting

Thane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.  We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.  I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting.  If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately.  As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???

2.	Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers

Thane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.  I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.

3.	Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs)

a.	Define workable TCR Product 
b.	End Balanced Schedule requirement 
c.	Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters
d.	BENA/OOM/AS
e.	Settlement & Billing

4.	Retail Issues

a.	REP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick)
b.	Reliant PTB (Pat Keene)
c.	TXU PTB (Pat Keene)
d.	Reliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene)
e.	TXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene)
f.	EES / EPMI License (Gloria Ogenyi + Nancy Hetrick)

5.	Information Flow

All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.  Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.  I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.

It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.  By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels ""cut out"".

The bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.  

6.	Wholesale Products

Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.

Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market.  This is our ""home"" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.  

Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.

Subject:	FW: RTO Waiver - Request for Comments


Hello  SE RTO folks

I know you all have a ton and half things going on - but I would like for you to look over the attached proposal that will be a waiver for existing control areas to assign certain control area functions over to a central RTO operator.  This waiver was originally intended for Grid South but since has expanded to include Alliance, SPP, MISO.  The purpose of the waiver is to allow for the continued existence of individual utility based control areas within an RTO AND to fulfill the FERC Order 2000 requirement that the RTO to implement Interchange Schedules.  This may become a direct conflict with our position for consolidation of control areas.

If you don't read anything else, I advise you to at least read - Sec 2.2 Rationale - 5 brief paragraphs which outlines what the RTOs want to do.   

Since I am chairman of the NERC Subcommittee that oversees Policy 3, Enron is associated with facilitating this process.  I want those working at the settlement conferences to be aware that this is coming.  Grid South's original intent was to change sections of Policy 3 to fit their new RTO structure.  I successfully argued against doing this on the basis that NERC policy should not prescribe the Grid South scheduling process and control area structure as reliability policy - hence the waiver.

Subject: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules



I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our ""Negative CTC Credits"" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

Thanks.

Subject: FW: EIA-910 Form - Monthly Natural Gas Marketer Survey


FYI - It looks like this is something that EES for sure and maybe ENA will have to comply with.  It is an EIA report required for all natural gas marketers with residential and/or commercial customers in the states of GA, MD, NY, OH, and PA; neither Leslie nor I received any notice of the potential requirement.  The OMB notice was published in the Federal Register in March, but since we don't typically monitor that publication, we did not see it, and I couldn't find any press reports on it.  Based on this correspondence, the first we heard about it was when EES got a copy of the form last week.
 
So that you don't have to plow through the attachment, here are the data elements that are to be reported for sales in each of the above states:
 
4. To how many end-use customers did you sell natural gas? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
5. How much natural gas did you sell to these customers? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
6. What was the revenue received for the natural gas commodity you sold to these
customers? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
7. Were there any receipts for distribution charges or taxes associated with the sale
of natural gas? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
_ Yes - Continue to Question #8
_ No - Skip to Question #9
8. How much were these receipts? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
9. Please use this space for any explanation that may be essential in understanding your reported data.
10. Enter the name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the person to contact concerning the information on this report.
 
At this point, we don't think there is anything we can do about this procedurally .  Any other ideas?  I will find out from Donna Greif how much of a problem, if any, they will have compiling the information.

I found the attached information on the EIA website.  (I copied the screens and pasted them to the word document, so the format is a little off.)  Note that the report is required for all natural gas marketers with residential and/or commercial customers in the states of GA, MD, NY, OH, and PA.  It appears that EIA received OMB approval for the reporting requirement in late May of this year for a three-year period.  The actual form is available on EIA's website, as explained in paragraph 5, but the data elements are shown on page 4 of the attachment.  Note also the last two pages of the document, where EIA plans for further reporting are discussed.

"California Strategy","Next Steps --

1.	Leverage EES Customers Signing Post August 25 Contracts

The language in SB78 continues to hold the date for suspending DA as August 25.  EES signed a number of very large contracts that benefit important in-state businesses.  We are trying to establish a strategy around the following segments:

a)	California Restaurant Association
b)	CMTA via the Aerospace Industry 
c)	Wal-Mart.

We need all of our customers to call (a) the Governor, (b) the key Legislative members, and (c) their trade associations.  Leveraging the trade associations is critical given CMTA's support for the bill.  We can release (very quietly) to influential persons Wal-Mart, Raytheon, and Northrop.

It is also critical that we try and contact someone from Boeing to get their read of the bill and its impact.  Our understanding is that they have recently signed a deal with another marketer and will be cut out by this Bill.  Any help in communicating with Boeing is critical.

Please let me know how best to approach the Calif Rest Association.  What should we do?  Is it better to have our customers call?

I will work up some talking points and phone numbers with Sue Mara to use in these discussions.

2.	Fight the CPUC on Retroactive Order

Sue Mara is working through AReM to convince the CPUC that their Proposed Decision would be illegal.  Continue to push on this front.  

Thanks,

Jim

Jim, I am in complete accord with your assessments and recommendations.  If we don't have the strategy to which you allude in paragraph 1 figured out by August 19, though, don't you agree that we need to go ahead and file?  We're owed more credits for the  pre-January 18 period than we'll ever recoup through these bills so it is sort of a moot point as far as the recoupment effort is concerned.

Bob --

Before we do anything on this issue, I would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues (primarily the proper reformation of the PX Credit calculation after Jan 18 and the application of the 1c/kwh surcharge).

On this issue, assuming that we haven't discuss the failure of SCE to apply our account's past credit with the CPUC (given that the bills were just received), I can't imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action.  

In addition, we have not identified where the ""credits"" are if they are not on the customer's accounts.  

My recommendation is to first (a) work with SCE - have Jeff Dasovich run the traps and (b) discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint. 

If this doesn't get us anywhere before August 19, then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC.  I am not opposed to LeBouef looking into federal action, but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies.

Please call me.

Jim

Subject:	PX Credit Claim

Now that we have the SCE bills showing that they are not going to credit past PX Credits against the T&D charges, here is the preliminary plan for challenging SCE's (and PG&E's anticipated) action.  As Diann explained, the bills begin becoming past due August 19, with late fees of 1.5% accruing thereafter.  Disconnect notices could be received 30 days thereafter, or about September 19.  Our target date for filing is Monday, August 20.  

     1.  Charley Ferguson (LeBoef Lamb) will prepare an analysis of the pro's and con's of challenging the action in federal court versus at the CPUC (considering, e.g., bias of CPUC, timing, disconnect protection, etc.).  Charley will draft alternative Complaints.   He will get the input of the bankruptcy lawyers on the draft PG&E complaint.  I will circulate these drafts as soon as they are available.

     2.  Charley will first meet with Jeanne Bennett for a ""download.""  After that meeting he will likely also wish to speak with Wanda and Diann for additional background information.  (Thank you for your generosity with your time.)

     3.  I will check with Sue Mara to see what, if anything, the other ESPs may be planning to do to challenge SCE's action.  Not many still have direct access customers, but some do.

     4.  I will talk to Jim Steffes about an unofficial approach to SCE.

Please let me know if I have missed anything, and I would appreciate it if you would forward this along to anyone else who you think may like to have this information.  Thanks.

The Maryland Public Service Commission has issued a notice requesting  comments on issues surrounding the Northeast RTO. These comments are due  Thursday, September 27th. I have gotten an extension until Monday,  October 1st for filing. 
The Maryland, D.C., Virginia and Delaware Commissions have all petitioned  FERC to rehear its July 12th Order on the RTO. FERC has granted  rehearing and anticipates issuing its Order on Rehearing on October  31st. 
The Maryland Commission will be holding a legislative hearing on Wednesday,  October 3rd at 11:00 a.m. and Thursday, October 4th at  10:00 a.m. The parties have been asked to file comments on the following  issues:
1. Cost Benefit Analysis.
2. Potential energy market savings and the distribution of those benefits  through the three ISO regions.
3. Cost of developing new computer programs and systems along with the risks  associated with implementation of new systems and business rules.
4. Specific examples of successful and unsuccessful introductions of new  energy markets, software, and business rules.
5. Affect on reliability from changing business rules.
6. Impact on transmission rates from uniform transmission pricing.
7. Cost of infrastructure development and the time frame required for  successful infrastructure transformation.
8. Information on current energy flows between regions.
9. Guidelines to be used to identify and implement best practices. 
10. Examples of successful and unsuccessful mergers between energy management  organizations.
This Commission notice is dated September 20th. It was not  e-mailed or faxed to any party and I have yet to receive a copy via mail. I  received a copy of this notice from the Executive Director TODAY while I was  attending a hearing before the Commission.
Please contact me immediately if you would like to submit comments, and I  strongly urge that we do.
I will be in hearings most of tomorrow morning, so please send me an e-mail  as well as leave me a voice mail, either at the office or on my cell phone.

Janine - my thoughts -

On the rate cases, I don't think we need any change of direction.  For the IP case, our argument is just the legal one of whether they can discriminate.  And there were a lot more parties involved with ComEd than IP, even though the issues are basically the same, so I wouldn't worry there about perception.

The bigger deal may be our protest of Dynergy's protest of Com Ed's treatment of Firm LD for marketers.  The filing has already been made, so we should stay on track.

Subject:	Illinois

Given the recent developments with the potential merger between Enron and Dynergy, there are a few policy questions in Illinois for which we would like guidance:

Illinois Power

We have intervened in the delivery service tariff case and are handling it primarily inhouse and solo - no other marketers.  Yesterday, we filed a Reply (greatly toned down - sticking to the facts only) to IP's memo contra our Motion to Dismiss.  URM decided not to do testimony so at this point we contemplate not showing up at the hearing and briefing only.  Recall that the issue is that to raise distribution tariffs for only unbundled customers taking service from an alternative supplier is unlawful and also anticompetitive and discriminatory, etc.  Our book impact could be around $2 million, I believe should IP get the full increase.  Moreover, it would stifle future competition.  

query:  Should our course of action be altered?


ComEd

ComEd parallels IP except that it is going forward first.  We made the same arguments on the Motion to Dismiss, which was denied by the Judge.  Our plan is to seek rehearing with the full Commission and to point out that the ICC filed comments at FERC with respect to increasing only unbundled transmission rates that were fully consistent with our arguments respecting distribution!

The case is currently in hearing and we have an Enron witness testifying.

In a separate move in this case, the City of Chicago and Cook county have filed a separate action requesting an audit and investigation of ComEd's books and records alleging basically that ComEd is seeking double recovery of costs.  If we intervened it might be possible to do so without paying any of the costs, assuming Blackhawk and AES/New Energy agree (we have done this for them in the past).
Upsides are that it would be viewed positively by the City of Chicago and Cook County as supporting them.  Downsides are that this really gets into rate issues that in previous RCR discussions we were told to stay away from and secondly, do we really want to be supporting an audit and investigation of another utility's books and records right now, given Enron's position?  

The last point is whether there is a perception problem in being more aggressive with Com Ed than IP on the rate discrimination issue, should we decide to take that path.

Evan, Thanks. The networking has begun. I, Jim and Harry met with Rebecca and Craig yesterday and explored the interface between Services and GA.
We identified several areas of collaboration and networking opportunities. It was a very positive meeting. I and Rebecca have scheduled to meet to outline the process.The effort will aim at bringing our two processes together to insure that we avoid any misinformation or suprises regarding all new market issues, and above all, to make sure that all our bases are covered.

Gloria,

Thank you for your note.  You did not offended me in any way that I am aware.

Frankly, Jim and I were discussing the appropriate routing of information to the EES Senior Management Team.  I believe that in any situation other than health or safety issues we have an obligation to factor in all constituents (ie. Rebecca Fite in this situation) and gain the facts before issuing statements about a topic that includes the President of our company in the distribution. 

I do value and appreciate your contributions on the ConEd efforts that preceded your e-mail regarding the Illinois Certification.  Unfortunately, your e-mail (that contained a key inaccuracy) caused several additional e-mails to be circulated and caused a bit of confusion.  In the future -- I agree wtih you and would like to avoid as much confusion as possible.

If you think it best -- I would welcome a meeting between Jim and you and Rebecca and me to better understand how to work together.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Evan

Evan,
I was standing beside Jim Steffes last thursday, when you gave him your ""editorial"" of me. In the 2 weeks that I worked with you on ConEd, I did not realise that I offended you in any way, personally or professionally. I have also had similar negative feedback from Jason Woodward, and I have never met or worked with him. 
Before your group assumed the new market role for EES, I worked very closely with Peter Vint, Robert Gresch, Beth Goodman and their groups on all new market issues. 
We worked as a team, and no matter at what point of the new market spectrum problems came up, we all pitched in to resolve the issues. Your group appears to have a more territorial approach to new market issues, and in the past have rejected my offers and efforts at networking. I have tried to respect that.

Prior to sending out the IL analysis, I placed a call to your group indicating that I was working on that analysis, and had some questions. I did not get a call back. Taking the time to return that call, may have saved us all some uneccessary stress. Well, good things do sometimes come from bad situations. The good thing is that we have all seen the need for a closer approach to new market entry issues. I intend to work with your group to develop a mutually acceptable level of interaction and interface.

Thanks,
Gloria

Gloria,
This is to confirm Con Edison's receipt of Enron Energy Services' wire for
billing agency security in the amount of $1 million.  Enron Energy Services'
cash deposit is subject to the NYS PSC approved interest rate for ""other
customer capital"".  Please note that interest will be paid on an annual
basis, and that the ""other customer capital"" interest rate changes each
calendar year.

Based on Enron Energy Services' successful completion of Con Edison's
billing agency test using hard copy bills, and our receipt of the signed
billing agency agreement and security deposit in the amount of $1 million,
Enron Energy Services may now begin enrolling new accounts with billing
agency status.  We will immediately code Enron Energy Services' existing
customer account population with billing agency status, as well.  As
previously agreed, Con Edison will express mail the bills produced each day
for Enron Energy Services' customer account population using Enron Energy
Services' Airborne Express account number to the address shown below:
	CSC BILLING DEPT
	700 MILAM NORTH TOWER 6FL
	HOUSTON, Texas  77002

Lastly, any future changes to Enron Energy Services' security coverage
amount or type will be done in strict accordance with the standards set
forth in the Uniform Business Practices.

If you have any other questions or comments, feel free to contact me.

Just a thought. In prep. for the PNW hearing it would be very useful to
spend a day with the PNW traders in Portland (or from another firm in the
group, if that were more appropriate) just watching what they do. It would
help give me some better insight into the practical mechanics of the market,
which may prove important in the hearing. All of the various regions have
their own rules and procedures, including the WSCC. We should check with
Fergus I suppose to make sure its OK from the litigation front before
calling anyone in Portland.

I am sending you a proposed budget for the California hearing this p.m. as
well, to copy to Steffes. I assume that CRA will take the lead on the number
crunching, and that i will just follow the work plan items communicated
earlier to Steffes.

These comments (10 sets) and their responses form the basis for 
the
further revisions made to the Phase IIA Standards by the Planning
Standards Subcommittee, in conjunction with the Compliance 
Review
Subcommittee and several other NERC Planning Committee 
subgroups.
These further revisions to Phase IIA are clarifying and editorial in
nature and are not believed to be substantive.

The resulting revised Phase IIA Planning Standards (June 15, 2001
version) were posted on August 2, 2001 for a 30-day notification
period prior to their consideration for approval by the PC. The posted
comments and responses complement these Phase IIA Standards.

Sincerely,

"Transition from Dick Ingersoll in NERC/WSCC","As some of you may be aware, Dick's consulting arrangement with Enron ends later this fall.  In an effort to make the transition as easy as possible, I would recommend that the following people work with Dick to transition on critical committees and tasks (nothing is hardwired, so if we need to change people, let me know).

Dick will attend the upcoming WSCC EPITF meeting (not sure of date, but think in the next two weeks).  My recommendation is that Steve Walton attend with Dick and become the lead.  We may not get a voting seat after Dick leaves, but we should try and cover.

Ray Alvarez should attend the WSCC Board Meeting on Aug 27 with Dick to pick up these responsibilities.

Charles Yeung should pick up coverage for the FlowBased discussions.  Dick will not attend the next meeting in Chicago that takes place on Aug 30.  

Andy Rodriguez should pick up the Security Coordinator Subcommitte discussions that take place Sept 25 - 27.  Dick will not attend.

I think that Charles, Ray, Dick and I should attend the NERC Stakeholders Mtg on Oct 15 - 16.

Finally, Dave Perrino should go with Dick to the next WSCC OCTPG meeting.

Let me know if this transition plan works.

Subject:	RE: Summary or PX Credit Proposals

An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9:  SCE said that it has TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesn't know what to charge for DWR. Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-related CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that will return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the ""market"".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE""s advice letter approaches, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some different PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they have a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (making it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollected while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surcharge.  The half cent addition is for 12 months.

Subject:	Summary or PX Credit Proposals


I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything.  

Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues associated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve Swain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is to have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th.  

Current Issues:
1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undetermined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)
2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not)
3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised PX credits 
4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D
5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charges), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions
6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE


The four proposals are as follows:

SCE Recommended Approach 
	This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 18, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the 	gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed.   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no 	generation/commodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent)  will be applicable to Direct Access customers.  

	Enron would request the following:
	1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC
	2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an ""allowable claim"" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possible.  
	3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument 
	4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent 	level. 
	5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if/when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC 

	Other consideration:
	Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


PG&E Recommended Approach
	This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January 18, 2001 would include an ""avoided cost""  component.  This avoided cost  
	component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDWR purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchases.  	This resulting ""avoided cost"" would be used in lieu of the PX clearing price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDWR purchase 	costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embedded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation.  
	
	Enron would request the following:
	Same as above

	Other Consideration:
	Enron  would continue to be exposed to ""price"" risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would hamper 	Enron's ability 	to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio. 

Hybrid Approach
	This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from January 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is 	applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal. 

	Enron would request the following:
	Same as SCE and PG&E approach

	Other considerations:
	Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


Enron Model 
	This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 and SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.   

	Enron would request the following:
	It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial is 	the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   However, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the ""value""	Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and CPUC.

	Other considerations:
	This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge ""price"" risk, but this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated with the 	actual collection of the PX credit.


Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we concluded in Wednesday's meeting.

Thanks,
Wanda Curry

On the hourly market price index, until we have LMP dispatch, the best we can do is a public index.  Let's not ask for too much.  Just something we can hedge against.  Can you talk with the EWS folks for the best index option???

Also, if the default is a monthly public index, why do the customer's need any ""parking""?  They can move directly to the new option.

What is your definition of ""functioning wholesale market""?  Are we stating that unless an RTO is running, we can't get rid of the PPO?  Maybe just resolve the Imbalance issue.  More specifics would be helpful.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	ICC Meeting

The ICC Energy Committee held a meeting to discuss ComEd's proposal to drop the PPO.  We argued that this should not be allowed until the wholesale market/delivery issues are dealt with because otherwise customers will have no choice but to return to ComEd at the higher bundled rate.  The good news is that a rather lengthy discussion on this issue ensued as a result.  The industrial customer group and Mid American Energy supported our views; however AES New Energy said that this was not a problem for them.

We also commented that once the PPO goes away it should not be resurrected due to the uncertainty it would create in the market.  ComEd responded that under the statute they can not offer to waive the PPO but could negotiate an arrangement on the CTC if approached by the customer.  This would mean that we could negotiate on behalf of all our customers regarding the CTC.  

We have the opportunity to file comments to the Commissioners before the actual filing.  A draft is attached. 

 << File: Commissioner Terry Harvill.doc >> 

If you have any comments, please respond by the end of the week.

"RE: PG&E PX Credit Calculation -- CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT","Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable ""HC"" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or  ""Est RT$""  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

Subject: RE: FERC Looking at ERCOT


The conventional wisdom around ERCOT is once direct assignment of the CSC congestion costs takes place, then flowing across the CSC does have a cost and those who schedule across will be more judicious.  The second assumption is that the stakeholders chose the wrong limiting element to be the monitored constraint.  90% of the congestion charges can be attributed to that wrong ""element"".  If direct assignmnet of the congestion and/or designating the correct limiting element are not feasible and ERCOT continues to see very large congestion it will move to an LMP model.  John Meyer, Shmuel Oren and most parties would agree with that.  This year will be very telling.
 
It would be worthwhile the coordinate with John prior to RTO week.

Thanks for the info.  Please stay closely linked with the RTO Week activities to try and read Wood's questions.

Also, John Meyer from Reliant is testifying.  What will be his position?  Should we talk with him this week to coordinate and try and move him the right way?  Wasn't he the head of Congestion Management in ERCOT originally?  I think this is Wood trying to ask him how ERCOT works.  What will he say?

Subject: RE: FERC Looking at ERCOT


Here are a couple of clarifying points:
 

The congestion charges that have been incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge.  If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols.  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation. 
When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model.  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge.  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned.  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit. 
It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice.  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially, but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion.

Thane --

Based on Wood's statements while at the PUCT, what issues will most likely drive his choice of a congestion management model?  My understanding is that Shumel Oren is on the panel at FERC, has he said anything recently that would argue that ERCOT may not be effective?  
 
Finally, what are the minor changes to the ERCOT protocols to overcome the current obstacles so that if adopted we could use across the country?

Pat Profeta of Northridge Assoc. (Entergy's congestion management consultants) told me this too and said that Michael Schnitzer of Northridge has been asked to be on the congestion management panel for RTO week.  Michael is a strong advocate of the ""SPP cornerstones"" that are largely the basis of the ""LMP/financial congestion hedge"" model (initial model!) advocated in the SE RTO mediation report.  They are going to contact Thane to get more information about ERCOT -- they recognize that ERCOT has some problems.

Agreed.  In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.  The market has reached $100 MM.

This is just a rumor we're hearing, but we heard that FERC wants someone who knows ERCOT congestion management on the congestion management panel for RTO Week  because FERC (presumably Pat Wood) wants to use the ERCOT congestion management system as the standard CMS throughout the country.  From what I know about ERCOT (which isn't much and I have a call in to Thane to get an update), this wouldn't be a good thing for us.  We'll keep you posted.

We're looking at three dates/times and I am interested in your availability if you plan on participating in the meeting.  First, a few people have asked that we do this meeting by conference call between Houston and DC so it won't involve traveling.  Second, the following dates/times are under consideration:

Wednesday, September 19th 1:00 - 3:00 pm CST
Thursday, September 20th 9:00 - 11:00 am CST
Monday, September 24th 1:00 - 3:00 pm CST

Please let me know if you're interested in participating and, if so, let me know which time slot works for you.  

Thanks,

"RE: PGE Gas Pipe Filing - NEXT STEPS","Thanks.  The key, of course, is to create a filing that could not be used against us at FERC on these issues.  I guess that amending the filing is better than withdrawing the filing and re-submitting.  My only thought would be that by withdrawing, PGE provides no trail.

I spoke with Jay Dudley on Friday.  I suggested he contact the FERC staffer on the case to explain that they want to withdraw the request for the native load exemption and will simply have PGE execute a contract with the pipeline.  He will call his attorney at Skadden to find out who that staff person is and then they will amend the application accordingly.  I think it will be fine in the end.

Not sure how this got through the ""process"".  Please feel free to call on me if this isn't getting fixed right.  Also, should we just have PGE pull the application and re-file with different terms.

Also, Becky you should let Amr know and keep track - he can try and quantify.

Leslie - 

Can you coordinate with Jay Dudley at 503-464-8860 on how to change the filing (if at all) on PGE's pipeline issue?  PGE is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on Native Load.  They are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity (about 170,000 mmcf/d) rather than assume its right.

The goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next Friday, Aug 17. 

Please call me with any questions. 

Thanks,

Gloria, Jim and Harry;

Thanks for pulling us all together on Monday. We look forward to working with your group on merging the State Licensing and Utility Agreements into a common area, in order to keep the organization informed and up to date.

I wanted to re-cap just a bit.  The Services Group has state licensing responsibility for Gas and Power for EESI and EEMC. We handle new licensing and renewals.  We are on an ""auto-reminder"" distribution from EES legal, Heather Mathis for renewals/reporting.  We physically house all documentation relating to licensing on our floor. We currently publish and distribute as needed State License status report which identifies where we are licensed and what our license # is.  The Services Group works directly with Gloria for utility agreements, as we are one of many groups who she obtains sign-off from and/or information in order to execute agreements and State Licensing information is critical to her processes.

Gloria and I met yesterday to discuss next steps.  We are working together to provide the following.

1) Matrix of Executed Agreements which includes: State, License #, UDC, Agreement Type, Signatory, Date Issued, Expiration/Renewal, Security Requirements. (2 Weeks)
2) Backfill each groups need for documentation - provide copies of State Licenses and/or UDC agreements. (2 Weeks)
3) Identify the EES/ENE contacts sent to the State/UDC, update as needed, internally and externally. (2 - 3 Weeks)
4) Provide Summary information regarding State/UDC that can be placed on EES Market Central (2-3 Weeks?)
5) Ensure information is updated, published, organized and accessible to all interested parties. - Gloria has initiated creating binders that will be housed on the 47th floor - we will encompass State information with the executed UDC agreements. 

Gloria, please feel free to add anything I have overlooked.  I've attached the contact list currently used when obtaining State Licenses. This should help identify other stakeholders who you may want to speak with.

 

Regards,
Rebecca

He called Phil's office today and was told that he would be out of town
until Tuesday.  Jim will call back on Tuesday.

Jim did talk with someone familiar with the bond issuance and he told him
that the Treasurer was ""stuck between a rock and a hard place.""   The
Treasurer's office is aware of the business community's position regarding
direct access but he said the PUC's hands were tied because AB1x directs the
PUC to suspend direct access.

He also told Jim that he had reviewed the correspondence sent from the
California Chamber and was pleased to see that businesses were willing to
pay exit fees for past energy purchases but that they were still concerned
about who would pay for bonds.

Ultimately, he said that direct access, the Edison bailout and other
outstanding energy issues would probably be worked out in a political
compromise.

I spoke to Sue Mara briefly and told her about the AB1x issue and she said
she would send to me a 1-page document regarding suspension of direct access
and the PUC.  Once I receive it, I will forward it on to Jim so he has it
before he speaks to Phil.

I told Jim that AB1x does not mandate when the CPUC has to suspend direct
access.  I also told him that I thought the Treasurer's advisors were being
very short-sighted about the bond issue since businesses that were denied
direct access would probably pull out of California and really shrink the
number of customers left to pay back the bonds.

ACC approved SWG rate order today with following relevant amendments:

   1.  SWG directed to file new imbalance language within 30 days adopting ""most expensive slice of gas"" methodology proposed by Enron/Midwest

   2. Staff to review filing for compliance with order - has up to 120 days for this, but SWG was warned from bench not to apply current imbalance calculation during that interim period.

   3.  Finding in Recommended Order upholding SWG's current interpretation of imbalance provisions deleted - Enron instructed from bench that it should file a separate complaint for the 2000-2001 winter period which ACC would consider ""without preconceptions""

   4.  Language about considering new types of transportation programs in the PGA workshops retained.

On the surface, I consider this at least a partial win.  However, Staff was particularly upset about these amendments and vowed off the record to use the 120 period to try to get the Commission to reverse its position on reducing imbalance charges.  I told Andy Bettwy that if SWG and Staff did not play games with this 30 day filing and acted in good faith during the workshops, we would be willing to discuss the issue of last winter prior to filing anything with the Commission.  He was non-committal.

"Meeting with N. Grid - KEY ISSUES","
A few thoughts before the NG meeting --

1.	Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (Paul Buckman) before our NG meeting.  You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.  I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.  We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.  Maybe Transelect has a better solution.

2.	Chief Issues with NG --
a.	are they ""really"" independent?  having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a ""market participant"" - I think that Enron should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence.
b.	who do they feel the customer is?  maybe we want to get Paul Dawson's take on their business model from the UK.  it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.? 
c.	who writes the tariff?  I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.  the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.  
d.	do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business?
e.	how do they intend to provide balancing energy?  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.  what is NG intending to do on this issue?  does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?  does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?  

Also, just to let people know, Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward.  Please keep him included on the e-mails.

Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5



If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

Here is a document Enron has prepared that describes what we want to see in a wholesale electric Standards Setting Organization (SSO).

I hope you will be able to consider these points for the letter you will be drafting from EPSA to the NERC Board of Trustees. 

Please do not distribute this until Jose Bestard, as member of the Stakeholder Committee, has had an opportunity to convey this to Mike Gent.

Bill B. from Ercot will be present, however he was not the most stellar witness.  Mark thinks Chairman Wolens will want to hear directly from the Chair of RMS.  The questions that you may be asked include:  what has RMS recommended to TAC, address issues of cutover from version 1.3 to 1.4...where are we, where do we go next, where are the participants on the issue?  Mark is preparing the list of questions and will email it to you soon.

On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday).

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

Jim,

	WSCC is voting on the formation of the WECC which will consolidated WSCC with the Western Regional Transmission Association and the Southwest Regional Transmission Association.  The Northwest Regional Transmission Association is likely to follow.  In order for this proposal to pass, 85% of the members must vote in favor and 90% of the control area MWs.  I think we should be there to vote for approval of the proposal.  In addition to combining the three (and possibly four) organizations, the change will alter the board make up, bringing independent members onto the board and allowing more latitude in membership.  The committees will be reevaluated as well and restructured over then next 2-3 years.

	Ray Alvarez is the member of the Board, so I talked to him about coverage.  He seemed to be uncertain about his availability.  I have an RTO West Congestion Management Meeting, where we are closing in on the final details of a financial rights model based on nodal pricing in real time.  I think I need to be there to keep the thing from getting fouled up.  Dave is close in Phoenix, so that was the reason that we tentatively made a reservation for him at the hotel.

Dear Mike:

The email you forwarded from Rob Wilson included the following request:

	""A side item- beyond the committees interest in hearing from our security personnel, Sue has asked if  an attorney in our 	group could assist her in drafting language, if needed, to provide exemptions/protections to FL sunshine laws regarding 	security related documents.""

In discussions with Lou and Colleen, we concluded that I would check with Rick Shapiro, Counsel for Legislative Affairs, to address the request.  Alternatively, we can seek assistance from local Florida counsel (e.g. Ann Longman in Tallahassee FL).  

I will let you know what develops soon.

Also, I understand that Rob Wilson is Manager of Regional Governmental Affairs in Tallahassee.  He mentioned that he had a prepared presentation that he had already used. Perhaps we should consider asking him to begin routing written matters on security through you and me for the time being.  Please ask him for a copy of the presentation before the conference call.  I assume we will meet in advance of the 10/24 call too.

Thank you.

Richard

Mike,

Richard Hixson, House staff and Sue  Skelton, Senate staff have requested a meeting w/ our security rep. on the 24th. I suggested a conference call, since the same individual will be the presenter on the 26th. A time has not been established for the call. The conference call would include Sue, Richard , and the House and Senate chairs of each committee, Dudley Goodlette and Ginny Brown -Waite respectively. The intent would be to brief this audience on current security practices on the pipe and initiatives we are participating in w/ other stakeholders i.e. INGAA, DOE, OPS etc... In addition, the chairs want to be aware of information we do not want to share and how to manage the committee Q and A.

 I have indicated the 26th presentation will be succinct, generic, but reassuring . We can manage the Q and A  w/ some general responses regarding our efforts w/ the Florida Law Enforcement Department and heightened state of awareness responses.

 A side item- beyond the committees interest in hearing from our security personnel, Sue has asked if  an attorney in our group could assist her in drafting language, if needed, to provide exemptions/protections to FL sunshine laws regarding security related documents. 

FYI- I have a presentation, I'll be using Monday w/ our PSC which includes bullet points on reliability and security, which should satisfy our needs for the 26th.

This is something we can do, but it will be at a very high level in terms of specific information shared. 

I suggest we have a confernce call on this next week (or before) to 1.) determine what the Florida House and Senate is expecting, 2) who should attend, and 3.) who else is invited. 

I will be out of pocket until next Monday, but could possibly call in if the timing was right.

Mike,

This morning legislative staff asked that I arrange for the appearance of an ETS security personality to address the House and Senate committees examining FL security issues. The committees tentatively plan to meet jointly on October 26th to discuss infrastructure security. There also will be a prehearing meeting on the 25th w/ committee leadership, to discuss the presentations. 

The hearing schedule and agenda continues to be a work in progress as legislative members and staff prepare for a special session to begin on Monday. However, I wanted to alert you to the possibility of needing someone from your shop on at least the 26th. I have seen most everything we've produced to date regarding this issue and drafting a statement will be relatively straight forward. As is always the case, it is the committee Q and A where the practitioner is most helpful.

I will keep you informed of any developments, my contact numbers are 850-350-5018 office;  850-544-6938 cell; 850-668-2782 home

Rob

At this point we dont have draft language and we dont have a settlement with language that allows us to push the way we can in Ohio.  My thought was to push for an investigation and see within that context how far we could go.  At a minimum, if a hearing were to be granted, I think we could end up improving the balancing rules for IP, CILCO, etc.  Com Ed has the most favorable provisions and could end up being the model.  In my discussions with Jeff Merola and Rogers Herndon, they can work with this however it is not optimal.  They need to do a transaction in order to figure out where the bugs are.

Subject:	ICC- Balancing

On Friday, I participated in ICC Chairman Mathias' Roundtable on the state of competition in Illinois.  One of the questions he asked was what the ICC could do to improve competition in Illinois.  I commented that the ICC could commence an investigation on the balancing rules of the various utilities, having pointed out the problem's with ComEd's and the fact that the other utilities are even worse.  He expressed concern over ICC jurisdiction and opined that to the extent that it impacts retail transactions and adversely affects retail competition, the ICC is within its jurisdiction to order the utilities to file an amended OATT before FERC for FERC's approval.  I plan to follow-up with a letter to him and all the Commissioners and would like feedback as to how hard I should push on this.  Should the ICC look into balancing (to which I give a less than 50% probability) we would have to be prepared to participate.  I think it would be highly worth the effort, especially as far as Illinois Power is concerned, however, I would like some feedback as to your views in order to guage how hard to push this.

Thanks,
Janine

With reference to the bills listed on the attached, pursuant to Rule 22 and

accounts.  Each of these accounts has a credit balance.  We are therefore
withholding payment.

Rick Hill and Chuck Ward called this week on a matter related to Cornhusker.  I had not heard about the potential financial harm from some ERCOT ISO rule changes until this call. 

This made me think.  It probably makes sense to meet with you and/or your team to make sure that Government Affairs is aligned with your business from a Development, Origination, and Generation Investments perspective.  

I'd like to try and meet at least quarterly to go through your business and to update you on recent regulatory developments.  How about sometime in early September?

On the off chance that you haven't seen it.  Feinstein is asking IEP for comments on her draft legislation that would increase regulation of natural gas, define what just and reasonable rates would be and increase refund power on the electric side.  I think we would have some concerns with her proposal.  If you want to pass along our comments to IEP, just get them to me.

Since this is a transfer of jurisdictional assets, the filing required is pursuant to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and Part 33 of the Commission's regulations. Part 33 lists information to be provided and it is fairly extensive.  In order to show that the transaction is in the public interest, the Commission requires that you provide a description of each applicant's business activities, ownership, affiliates and subsidiaries (with a description of their business activities), a list of wholesale power sales customers of the applicants, and of course a description of the transaction.  We made a similar filing recently for the New Albany sale.  

There may also have to be a Section 205 filing made if any tariff revisions are required. This is usually a pretty quick filing to prepare.  In the case of the New Albany sale, some minor changes had to be made to the affiliate portion of the tariff sheets.

For the New Albany sale, we used LeBoeuf, Lamb as our counsel.  (Christi -- is this typical, or do we sometimes use Bracewell instead?  In any event, if closing is imminent it sounds as if we need to proceed very quickly.  Please call to discuss.)

Yes. this requires regulatory approval.  It would be a filing that has a 21 day notice period.  It typically requires 45 - 60 days for approval, but we could ask for expedited approval.  I would recommend hiring Andrea Settanni at B&P to make the filing.  She said it would be less than $5000.  I think that on the past sales, either ENA legal or the commercial group hires the outside counsel.  Susan Lindberg can help coordinate it.  Thanks.

	Christi,

	if we are selling our interest in Doyle I LLC to Walton EMC, does this require any regulatory approval?  Keep in mind that it will be PGI selling its interest to Walton EMC in the Doyle I LLC.  Doyle I LLC contniues to be the counterparty to the PPA.  It would seem that this should not be a reg issue but we want to make sure.

	Thanks, Ron.

	Ron,

	Given that you want to close by the end of the month, has anyone checked to see what regulatory approval will be needed to transfer our 50% interest.  I suspect that we will need FERC approval as Doyle is an EWG with ""cost-based-rate"" authority.  As an aside, Dan Watkiss did the regulatory work and might be able to respond most quickly.

	Stuart

Subject:	RE: CA question

Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

It appears that the calculation and collateral call is pretty accurate.  Basically, EPMI had made significant purchases from the New England pool to fill the UI, NSTAR and CMP load (approx 1,000 mw/h).  Based on a 42 hour post petition calculation, ISO projects 30 day exposure at $39MM.  Since collateral is calculated at 3.5x, we would owe $137MM in collateral.  Unless we feel that our load/supply shape will change, as per the letter, we can request the ISO to reconsider the collateral amount.  Let me know your thoughts.

Working g Group Meeting
Importance: High


Attached is a work plan for a 3-RTO working group (known as SSG-WI) to develop a market monitoring plan for CAISO, RTO West, and WestConnect.  It is turning into the (western) United Nations of Market Monitoring.  According to the attached plan, ""This work plan is structured to first agree on the MME's authority and responsibilities, and then focus on the best structure to effectuate the agreement.  ""  

We need to quickly decide our level of participation.  Dave participated in a meeting last week and it got them to not send out biased meeting notes. To actually steer the BPA-CAISO train into something we live with, however, will take a lot of work.  I suggest that we bring this up on our next ""Western"" call.  That being said, I will be on a plane on Thurs morning.  (Ray, could we have the Thursday call at 8:30/10:30/11:30 PST/CDT/EST??)

Hi --

Here's the revised work plan that incorporates Steve's comments.  (I've added a meeting and moved forward some of our ""resolution""
dates.  I've also inserted a meeting location rotation.)  I've attached both a red-line and clean version of the work plan.

I think this is ready to go, although everyone might want to take one last look (especially as it sets out an aggressive schedule).
Steve, I assume you'll take care of forwarding the meeting notes and the work plan to SSG-WI.  Let me know if there is anything else
I can do to help.

Thanks!  Kristi

Vol. 3, No. 21
When is  Bigger Better?
The Acquisition of Orion by Reliant
The  possible acquisition of Orion Power, the owner of many plants that serve the  Pittsburgh area, by Reliant Resources is the fifth major transaction affecting  Pennsylvania's generation and electric service since 1996. Reliant Resources'  attempt to buy Orion Power, however, raises issues not seen before in other  transactions. 
Those transactions - the PECO Energy and Unicom merger,  the GPU and First Energy merger, the sale of GPU's power plants, and Duquesne  Light Company's swap of plants with First Energy and subsequent purchase by  Orion - did not increase the market power of a particular generation owner.  
Why not? All the other transactions involved companies operating in  different markets, or companies that did not own generation, or sale of power  plants from one company to one or more companies. In fact, taken together these  transactions reduced consumer costs, protected rate caps, and decreased stranded  costs. They also led to important environmental improvements like new pollution  control investments and support for renewable energy.
Reliant Resources,  however, already owns generation within PJM and the purchase of Orion would add  generation to its PJM share, once Duquesne joins PJM West. For this reason, the  transaction should be carefully reviewed and used to formulate a new policy  concerning consolidation of generation assets within a single  market.
Specifically, regulatory bodies should make increased demand  response a condition for any transaction that increases generation consolidation  as demand response strongly mitigates market power. Funds should be devoted to  ensuring that all consumers with a load of 50 kilowatts and above are equipped  with time-of-use meters. This measure is necessary, as the single biggest  regulatory mistake to date in electricity restructuring is the failure to make  demand response a central part of restructuring. Without it, workably  competitive markets will not develop or be sustained.
Apart from  increasing demand response, regulators and the Office of Consumer Advocate  should get answers to the following questions:
- Will Reliant Resources  permit Duquesne Light Company, the local distribution utility, to offer in its  service territory a competitive default service (CDS) program modeled after the  successful CDS program operating in the PECO Energy service territory? 
-  Will Reliant Resources exercise market power within local markets and should  particular plants be excluded from this acquisition to eliminate market power?  
- Will Reliant Resources commit to supporting economic demand-response  programs within PJM, instead of voting against demand response as it has done  recently?
- Will Reliant Resources acquisition help finance installation of  time-of-use meters for all customers with demand more than 50 kilowatts within  the Duquesne control area?
- What will Reliant Resources do to clean up some  of the heavily polluting plants that it owns now or will acquire from Orion?  
Reliant owns portions of Keystone and Conemaugh and Shawville power  plants. It would buy from Orion the Cheswick unit. Keystone and Cheswick have no  scrubbers installed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, while Shawville has been  scrubbing one out of four boilers. In 2000, Keystone, Shawville and Cheswick  respectively released 153,490 tons, 48,243 tons, and 44,908 tons of SOx into  Pennsylvania's air. Keystone is also the biggest emitter of mercury in the  entire country and all four plants spew huge amounts of nitrogen oxide - at a  rate more than double the modern standard of .15 lbs/mmbtu. That's not all - all  four plants produce an amazing 30 million tons of carbon dioxide, helping  Pennsylvania to contribute 1 percent of the entire world's human-induced global  warming gases.
Reliant can begin cleaning up by implementing in the  Duquesne area the equivalent of the PECO Service Territory's CDS program, which  includes a Renewable Portfolio Standard that increases annually the amount of  renewable energy that must be supplied to customers. CDS customers there are  served by New Power and Green Mountain Energy at 5.56 cents per kilowatt-hour  (kWh), more than three cents less than the 8.65 cents per kWh PECO Energy  charged its residential customers in 1996 for coal and nuclear power.  
Market Power Issues
In addition to environmental  issues, market power issues must be examined. Such an inquiry hinges on defining  the relevant market and products. 
Nationally, total generation capacity  is approximately 800,000 MW, with most of it subject to base rate regulation in  the retail market. Despite regulation at retail, wholesale generation  transactions are generally price deregulated in all 50 states, whether or not  the entities engaged in the transactions are deregulated generation owners,  regulated public utilities, municipal utilities, or electric cooperatives and  whether or not necessary market institutions required for workably competitive  markets exist. 
Orion Power has been participating in the deregulated  wholesale market. It owns 81 power plants in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and  West Virginia, producing approximately 6,000 MW and has another 5,000 MW under  construction. Orion has done an exceptional job, improving the forced outage  rates, especially among its New York City resources.
The proposed  acquisition of Orion Power by Reliant Resources will form the nation's second  largest deregulated power generation owner, controlling 17,279 MW, or 6.15  percent of the deregulated generation market that totals 281,000 MW of the  country's total capacity. Reliant Resources has a smaller share of the nation's  total generation capacity. 
Yet these small national shares do not  guarantee that Reliant Resources could not have market power in portions of the  PJM Market. 
Prior to this proposed acquisition, Reliant Resources owned  about 7 percent of total PJM generation, or 4,262 MW of generation capacity  within the 58,000-MW PJM market. These facilities include 2,009 MW of base load,  803 MW of intermediate load, and 1,450 MW of peaking capacity. They are quite  old and formerly owned by GPU and Sithe (see table in attached document).  Reliant Resources is also developing another 1,316 MW within PJM. 
These  numbers would indicate that regulators should focus on possible market power  within the Duquesne Control Area of the units that Reliant Energy is purchasing  from Orion. The Duquesne Control area is scheduled to become part of PJM West in  2002, but regulators and the Office of Consumer Advocate should ensure that no  plant is strategically located within the transmission system so that it  possesses market power even after incorporation of the control area within PJM  West. If any plants that would give Reliant Resources market power are  identified, they should be removed from this acquisition.   
Addressing Market Power
The combination of large  generation owners creates concerns over market power that can only be identified  and addressed by sound regulatory action. In all three of the Northeastern ISOs,  there have been incidents of market power which have resulted in numerous rule  changes. There are several reasons that the electric industry is sensitive to  market power. First is the inability to store energy. In many other industries  surpluses can be built up in low demand periods and used to fill in gaps during  high demand periods. In the electric industry, energy is produced and consumed  virtually instantaneously. Second, there are barriers to entry in the electric  industry, including discriminatory interconnection practices and other incumbent  advantages. Third, historically the demand for electricity has been inelastic  and creates the opportunity for inflated prices. Inelastic electricity demand is  not surprising when most customers see average prices and do not have metering  or the ability to respond to prices.
For these reasons, concrete steps to  combat market power in the electric industry must be taken. For starters, the  existing market mitigation measures, such as PJM's $1,000 price cap, should be  examined to determine if they are sufficient, while not being burdensome as to  limit new generation resources from entering the market. 
Secondly,  barriers to entry should be reduced, especially for distributed generation and  environmentally beneficial grid technologies like wind energy. 
Lastly  and most importantly, demand-response programs can and must be developed.  California has shown that energy efficiency can preserve reliability and break  the market power of generation owners. Changing the demand for electricity is  the biggest and best protection against market power. 
A Deeply  Troubling Tale
Unfortunately, Reliant Resources did not support  PJM's Economic Demand Response programs, voting against them last year in the  Members Committee. It had company, with all generation owners voting as a block,  with one exception, against demand response. Three cheers for the exception:  Edison Mission. 
In the face of the mass opposition of generation owners,  PJM wobbled but did not cave. It changed but submitted demand-response programs  to FERC which were approved for the summer of 2001. 
The moral of this  tale is that the public interest needs regulators, the PJM Board, and other  interested parties to further demand-response initiatives, because generation  owners will likely be roadblocks. In particular, real-time metering, residential  air conditioning and heating programs, and wholesale markets all need to be  developed. 
It is time for strong action on these points. Regulators must  begin by requiring Reliant Resources to finance the installation of time-of-use  meters for all customers with demand of 50 kW or more within the Duquesne  control area. This is especially important as the transition there may be  completed by 2004.

I agree we need to do it.  You may want to ask Boston Pacific to include an analysis of the savings associated with reduction in capacity reserves ( reductions due to increased load diversity, increased reserve sharing and reduced operating reserves to meet NERC criteria).  Some of these savings should be immediate and some should occur over the next few years from decreased need for capacity additions.  I'm not sure whether someone has done this type of analysis before for one of the RTOs, but Christi has talked about some of this and may know.

It would be a way to check the on goings in ENA, EES, and GA as a group.  It would also be an effective tool whenever we needed a GA valuation.  When you have a moment, I would like to explain the project to you and get your input as to how we could design the best system.  Please let me know when you have a chance to talk.

FYI.  The following language mirrors that which was used in the Sierra/PGE transaction.  Recall that FERC approved the transaction in an order issued last January/February.  

In short, we don't have an RTO/loss of market-based ratemaking authority issue.  

(1)	PGE/NNG will make an RTO commitment; and 
(2) 	In any event, FERC counsel informs us that FERC is unlikely to declare that we are an affiliate.

I would ask Mike about the last sentence in bullet 5.  Based on the language of the quote the Commission appears to be referring to the surcharge ""adopted in D. 01-03-082.""  Was the .01 surcharge ""adopted"" in that proceeding?  Maybe I am reading this too literally.  I do agree that the rationale for exempting DA customers from the 3 cent surcharge applies equally to the 1 cent surcharge, and that we should continue to strive for this clarification at the CPUC (which Sue Mara is handling).  Sue, I am forwarding this to you for your comments.

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

BINGAMAN HALTS ENERGY
LEGISLATION FOR NOW

But Strange Wording Leads to Questions
About Senate Plan

As Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-NM,
tells it, Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle urged him to suspend Energy
& Natural Resources Committee's
effort to mark up ""of energy legislation
for this session of Congress.""
""Instead, the chairman will propose
comprehensive and balanced energy
legislation that can be added by the
majority leader to the Senate calendar
for potential action prior to
adjournment.""
Before the Senate adjourns in the
next few weeks or at the end of the
year?
We got the news at 6:03 pm
yesterday and were unable to get a
clarification. For Bingaman it's
""increasingly clear to the majority
leader and to me that much of what we
are doing in our committee is starting to
encroach on the jurisdictions of many
other committees...
""With the few weeks remaining in
this session, it is now obvious to all
how difficult it is going to be for these
various committees to finish their work
on energy-related provisions.
""Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, the Senate's leadership
sincerely wants to avoid quarrelsome,
divisive votes in committee.
""At a time when Americans all over
the world are pulling together with a
sense of oneness and purpose,
Congress has an obligation at the
moment to avoid those contentious
issues that divide, rather than unite,
us.""
Bingaman will build consensus with
members of his committee with other
committee chairs and with other
senators as he readies a proposal to
present to the majority leader.
The message doesn't seem to rule
out getting a package to the majority
leader that could be put into a
conference report at some opportune
time, thus avoiding committee
arguments over drilling versus
comprehensive electricity reform. We
suspect because of Bingaman's views
at the Enron dinner last week that he's
thinking of Senate action next year.
Joe Barton, R-Tex, is going ahead
today with hearings on RTOs, reliability
and the need for comprehensive
electricity legislation.

Today after the Hearing I attended lunch with John Anderson and Phil Harris.  One of the primary points of discussion involved what to do to respond to the NERC legislative efforts?

Basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over reliability to FERC made sense for all of the groups.  Agreeing to that, the idea is to review the Bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to that language.   

I think that internally Enron is already there???  John Shelk, if you could pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that would be very helpful.

I'll let you know how we next proceed.  If anyone has any problems, please let me know.

You were right. SPP is going to use this episode as a lever to be ""promoted"" to an RTO. 

Texas is recommending three steps to introduce competition at Texas-SPP. One is described as follows:


*	Support the SPP's efforts to begin wholesale market operations: Mr. Brown, Vice President of SPP, testified that SPP can begin wholesale market operations and complete systems testing by April 1, 2002. He has requested that the SPP Board approve his recommendation to start to wholesale market operations. This Commission should support that process by:

-	Requesting in writing that the SPP Board begin wholesale operations as soon as possible with a target date of completing systems testing by April 1, 2002.
-	Advising FERC of the need to support SPP wholesale market operations. While Mr. Brown testified that the recent July and September Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) orders regarding SPP's start up expenditures will not impede SPP from implementing wholesale market operations, this Commission should advise FERC that the findings from our hearing show the need for FERC to fully support SPP wholesale operations startup.

I was speaking yesterday with Chuck Ward.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  

This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and Enron will have.  

I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.

Subject:	ICC- Balancing

On Friday, I participated in ICC Chairman Mathias' Roundtable on the state of competition in Illinois.  One of the questions he asked was what the ICC could do to improve competition in Illinois.  I commented that the ICC could commence an investigation on the balancing rules of the various utilities, having pointed out the problem's with ComEd's and the fact that the other utilities are even worse.  He expressed concern over ICC jurisdiction and opined that to the extent that it impacts retail transactions and adversely affects retail competition, the ICC is within its jurisdiction to order the utilities to file an amended OATT before FERC for FERC's approval.  I plan to follow-up with a letter to him and all the Commissioners and would like feedback as to how hard I should push on this.  Should the ICC look into balancing (to which I give a less than 50% probability) we would have to be prepared to participate.  I think it would be highly worth the effort, especially as far as Illinois Power is concerned, however, I would like some feedback as to your views in order to guage how hard to push this.

Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") are exposed to market, credit, operational and liquidity/funding risks in the normal course of its business activities.  The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the ""Policy"") on August 14, 2001.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluated, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transactions via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes, and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of various risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management framework.  

Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Following an initial transiton period, various individuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk management framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an example of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.

Just a thought for you - I can assure you,  based on the experience in the Ontario market with other retailers, that the more Enron Direct uses independent sales channels (i.e. direct mail, telemarketing, door to door),  the compliance issues (ie. compliance by the independent sales forces with applicable codes of conduct and consumer /business practices legislation) will mushroom.

"Letter from Leadership Council to Bush WH","Jamie --

Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.  

First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the proper focus.

In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.

Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.

Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.  While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working. 

Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.

If you want to talk, please let me know.

Gloria and I agree that the situation in Texas could be currently described as ""reasonable"" for the time being; this taking into consideration the ""Triple B"" from S&P of today.  Here is the analysis.

1.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.1  purports that a deposit for a competitive retailer shall not be required provided that the retailer has not defaulted within the past 24 month.  If it defaults, then a deposit is required.  Gloria and I understand that we did not default. 
2.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.2 purports that the size of deposit is 1/6 of the estimated annual amount to be billed under the tariff.
3.	The Tariff for Retail Delivery Service, Art. 4.5.1.2 purports that a form of deposit is any affiliate guaranty from an affiliate with long-term unsecured credit ratings of not less than ""BBB-"" or ""Baa3"" (or equivalent) from S&P or Moody's, respectively.  It is important to mention that other forms of security may be mutually agreed to.

I think we should be represented.  Nevada is a big market, so if it gets screwed up, it should be with our participation.

Subject:	Southwest Gas filing in Nevada

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.  Please let me know what you would like me to do on this.  Thanks.

Subject:	Ada Plant Negotiation

Victor -- This is just a brief note to memorialize our earlier conversation today.  You had asked me whether there were any regulatory impediments to Enron renegotiating the Ada contract with Consumers so as to increase the value of the deal to our mutual benefit.  Specifically, you inquired whether changing the PPA to permit us to source the power used to comply with tour obligations under the contract from the market.  The changes you recommend to make to the PPA would not change the rate paid by Consumers but rather, the sourcing requirement. 

	 My preliminary assessment is that such PPA changes would not need to be filed for approval at the PSC.

I have several reasons why the above mentioned changes would likely not have to be approved by the Commission.  First, rate increases must be  subject to hearings and approval by the Commission.  Consumers has a frozen purchased power/fuel adjustment clause and any changes in its contracts could not be passed on to customers during the term for which that rate is frozen. Since the rate could not increase, there would be no chance to pass through to customers a rate increase hence, no requirement to seek approval.  Moreover, after Consumers' fuel/purchased power  adjustment clause is reinstated, we could reneotiate the contract downwards and pass on a small savings (again, a rate decrease)to customers and we and Consumers could split the lion's share of the savings revenue.  Lastly, but more significantly, the Michigan law that pertains to utilities recovering QF costs through rates only provides authority to the Commission to review PPA changes if the costs for power and energy increase.  Our proposed changes are not likely to be deemed to be a rate increase.  Generally an unchanged rate for a service with a declining quality of service ( e.g., a firm transport service changed to an interruptible service at the same rate)could be construed as a rate increase thus triggering the Commission's authority.  Our proposal is quite different from that instance because, as I understand it, the change we propose would only affect our power sourcing ability and that Consumers would remain able to call on the Ada unit's capacity at all times if needed.  If changed as described, Consumers will receive the full quality and quantity of service for which it contracted under the PPA so its rights seem undisturbed.  The only change we seek is for Enron to have an option for power sourcing, which should be ""invisible"" to Consumers  -- except for the check we provide them as inducement.

I look forward to meeting with you Friday of this week to discuss this matter more fully.

Ed
	
As a first step, please could you check the position as to the bonds we have posted and provide me with details as to the volume of trades we have entered into since December 2 this year and for the same period last year. In addition please could you confirm what our NEPOOL Charges have been for the last 12 months.
	
My initial reaction is that, provided the bond holders have not sought to withdraw the bonds and confirm that to us, then ISO-NE's position is considerably weakened. The fact that they only allege ""purported notice"" gives me something to work with, in that it is either notice or it is not.
	
The amount that they are seeking does appear to be on the high side, especially having regard to what I am assuming is  reduced activity by certainly EPMI, in NEPOOL since December 2. 
	
I will review the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy to ensure that there is nothing we have missed and subject to the data and information in respect of the bonds posted by us and the activity data I would seek to challenge this as a valid notice and state that we are still in compliance with the Financial Assurance Policy.

Subject: CEC Siting Regulation: Staff Report and Business Mtg. Scheduled
for Sept 12


Recently, the CEC initiated a Rulemaking on siting.  The purpose is to
review and rewrite the Commisison's Rules related to siting of new
generation.  As the Siting Committee has failed to convince the full
Commission of how best to proceed, the Commission is scheduling a Business
Meeting on Sept . 12 to discuss this matter and, presumedly, provide the
Commission direction.

Attached is a staff report laying out the issues.

IEP is monitoring this matter through its Regulatory Committee.  Presently,
staff plans to attend the meeting.  Comments on the staff report prior to
the Business meeting on the 12th,  as well as comments on other matters
related to the Commission's Rules regarding siting, would be advantageous.

IEP is interested in hearing from company's willing to fund a stronger
intervention (i.e. the development of comments, etc.) than mere presence at
the Business meeting.  Please contact Steven Kelly ASAP if your company is
interested in IEP developing comments on this matter.

30% of my time
 
Provide regulatory support to West Power (Renewables, QFs, market structure issues)

Assist in the coordination of efforts between West Power and Government Affairs 
Report to Elliot Mainzer (and indirectly Chris Calger)

70% of my time
 
Contribute to the RTO campaign

Sue Nord approached me about working on this campaign.  She anticipates that the specific needs of the team will become more clear in the coming weeks. 
Report to Sue?

 
****************
Note: I expect these new responsibilities would necessitate a shift in my focus away from the work I have been doing on California and Price Risk Management, as well the occasional projects/research I do for Jim, Alan and others in this department.

A couple of points --

1.	The language in the relief indicates that we are trying to ""determine the validity and amount of PX Credits owed to EES and EEMC"".  Is this correct?  Isn't our primary goal in this complaint to (a) have the Utility return the net credit to our bills and (b) to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges?

2.	Throughout the document the idea of ""T&D charges"" is used.  I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges?  We pay CTC and public purpose costs as well as T&D.

3.	Not sure if CPUC regulates the ESPs.  The filing makes this case in the first paragraph.

Subject:	California Update--08.27.01

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those ""involuntarily"" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the ""effective date"" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

Further detail from Con Ed on the request for payment of delivery charges -

They are saying the deadline is 5 pm EST this Friday, Dec 21.
The amount of arrearage is about $1.5 million (and growing).  This is based on outstanding agency billings from yesterday back to when they stopped receiving payment from us, Nov 29.  They say they send us ""a stack of bills every day"".
They also need payment detail (which accounts should receive credit for payment) on wire transfers that were received prior to Nov 29.  Rebecca Fite had been involved.  They say information on this was sent to Diann Huddleson and Joe Falcone(CSC) on Dec 10.
The arrearage is now greater than the posted collateral; hence the demand for payment or end of agency billing.

Evan, Diann - are we continuing to track these bills ?

Hey, Jim! 
  How are you and Marianna and Grace doing?  Well, I hope!  I don't know if Jason has mentioned to you that Roger and I have been living in Birmingham, Alabama - no, not in a trailer.  Roger moved here with work last November, and I finally caught up with him early this summer.   
   In the meanwhile, he has left the company he was working for, and we are looking at moving back to Houston.  Roger has spent the last six years in the recyclable steel (steel scrap) trading business as a trader.  We have noticed that Enron is involved in steel trading, as well as coal trading - two areas in which Roger would be very interested pursuing possible opportunities.  I was wondering if you would be able to provide us with a couple of potential contact names of people who work directly over those areas.  I hope I am not putting you on the spot.  We just believe that it would be much more fruitful to be able to make contact in that manner.  If you are not comfortable doing that, I would certainly understand. 
    In any event, please drop me a line and let me know how you are doing!  It has been a while.  Was the sailing trip with Jason and Shea the last time I saw you?  That was pretty fun!  I hope Jason hasn't sold the boat.  If we ever do get back to Houston, I would love to do that again.  I haven't talked to Jason since July - when we were able to go to lunch.  I'm hoping he and Shea are still making a go of it.  They would make a great pair!  Anyway, I hope to hear from you soon!  Thanks!   Lisa

Subject: Enron v. FERC appeal at DC federal court (Entergy source and
sink)


The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).

It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts?

Jim -- The Michigan PSC just promulgated its electric code of conduct.  Attached is a copy of that code.  It requires that electric utilities and Alternative Energy Suppliers must file information that includes a legal address and party for service, organization chart showing utility affiliation.  For purposes of the Code utility includes providing regulated service and regulated service means that the rates are established by the Michigan PSC.  Thus, it does not appear that we have a conflict with either EPMI or our QF-owning affiliates regarding this code.  In those instances, regulated utilities may be our contractual counterparties but are not our affiliates.  MPSC approval of a QF's PPA should not elevate that agreement to the status of a regulated service.  If Enron bought a utility in Michigan this answer would obviously be different.  
	For reasons similar to those regarding EPMI and the QFs,  EES should not present a problem either.
	As history has shown, it is always good to check!

Subject:	FERC exceeded jurisdiction w/RTO say consumer groups

FERC Exceeded Jurisdiction With RTO Order - Consumer Grps 

Aug. 14, 2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

(This article was originally published Monday) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- New England consumer advocates Monday said federal energy regulators overstepped their jurisdiction in ordering the consolidation of the wholesale electricity markets and transmission systems in the northeast U.S. 

The Federal Energy Commission in mid-July directed operators of the power grids in New York, New England and the Mid-Atlantic to merge, as part of a sweeping series of orders designed to put control of the country's transmission system in independent hands. 

Federal law allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require transmission systems to connect, but only at the request of a state regulators, according to a filing made by Maine law firm on behalf of consumer groups, nonprofit energy groups and the attorney general of Massachusetts. 

""The Commission makes no claim in the New England Order that it is acting at the behest of a state commission or public utility, and is, therefore, without authority to mandate the involuntary combination of the Northeastern RTOs,"" the groups said in their filing, which asked FERC to reconsider its consolidation decision. 

FERC should give the three Northeast grid operators a transition period to evolve into three regional transmission organization, or RTOs, with similar market designs, transmission tariffs and governance structures before requiring them to merge, the filing said. 

The commission directed the operators of the wholesale power grid in New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic to meet with utilities, generators, trade groups, state regulators and a FERC judge in Washington for 45 days beginning July 19 to outline plans for creating one transmission organization from Washington, D.C., to Maine. The regulators also directed Judge Peter Young to submit recommendation to them 10 days after the conclusion of the talks. 

The commission ordered the consolidation of the Northeast power grid ""at breakneck speed"" without studying the technical feasibility of creating one RTO and without analyzing the costs and benefits of merging, the consumer groups said in their filing. 

Young has directed meeting participants not to discuss the substance of the negotiations, but sources familiar with the talks said the group is outlining a business model describing how to structure a Northeast RTO without filling in the details. Participants have said, for example, that this regional market should have one transmission tariff and one interconnection standard, but haven't defined what that tariff and standard should be. 

""Many people are very discouraged by the ongoing talks,"" said Anthony Buxton, an attorney with the Maine law firm that submitted Monday's filing. 

All 300 meeting participants have been gathering in Washington twice a week and have been working on the issues every day outside of those meetings, Young said. Next week, they will break off into smaller groups and begin meeting every day, according to Young and market participants. 

The commission was in turmoil when it issued its RTO decision, as evidenced by Chairman Curt Hebert's resignation last week, and should therefore reconsider its order, Buxton said. 

The consumer groups also asked the commission to allow residential electricity users to have a say in how the unified electricity market in the northeast U.S. will run. Market participants, including consumers, will have an advisory capacity only in this new market and won't be allowed to vote on the rules that govern the market, as they do now, Buxton said. 

This decision contradicted another one FERC issued in 1996 requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competitors. In that order, the commission encouraged New England to create an independent system operator to oversee the power grid and to give market participants equal say in determining how this regional transmission system and electricity market would operate 

The consumer groups that filed Monday are working to galvanize other organizations representing residential customers in New England, Buxton said. 

""Consumers are going to be at the forefront of a massive attack on FERC for what it's done,"" Buxton said.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;	boundary=""=====================_640249==_.ALT""

Dear Colleague,
The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.
Here is a summary of the paper:
        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.
        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry. 
        Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.
        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:  
Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.  
Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.  
Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).  
Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.  
Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.  
Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.  
Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).  

        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options. 
        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time. 
        Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices. 
        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Subject:	RE: Call Regarding Prehearing Conference on Our Negative CTC complaint

OK.  Haven't heard back from Bob, but we may be able to avoid the call.  Mike Day got in touch with Edison's attorney this morning and here's the end result.

Edison has agreed to tell the judge on the 7th that, with respect to the complaints we've filed, they agree to take them off calendar until and unless parties ask to put them back on calendar.
Edison will  take the view that the proceedings underway at the commission (and presumably attempts to ""settle"" with parties) will resolve the issues in the complaint.
The assumption from out end is that the status quo remains intact.  That is, we will continue to pay the Commission, not Edison, for T&D charges during the ""time out"" on our complaints.  
Mike and Jeanne will make sure that this critical piece, i.e., that we continue to place payments in escrow, will remain intact as part of the ""time out.""  If it turns out there are any doubts about this aspect, we'll likely need regroup and reconsider our options.

If anyone has any questions or concerns please speak up, and/or if folks would still like to have a very brief call to discuss, we can do that and ensure that Bob is kept in the loop and can weigh in when he returns.

Comments/thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I tried to make it clear that we were not ourselves moving off of 4/5 RTOs -- and I will try to make that clearer.  I was just trying to take advantage of what Wood and others said to show that they are not the heavy-handed regulators that Barton and others on the Hill are painting.  In other words, I wouldn't have asked them to say what they did -- but once said, we might as well get some mileage out of it.

Attached for review and comment is a draft set of talking points on the Barton RTO discussion draft.  I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft.  You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents: (1) that FERC is rushing and being heavy-handed and (2) that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities (i.e., no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedy).

Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days.  Once Capitol Hill is up and running again, we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to members/staff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion draft's treatment of RTOs.

This guy was listed on the Ken spreadsheet (about T&D bills) as being an EES customer in November.  Is this a residential account?  

Thanks,

Jim

So it is correct to say that EES is responsible for the final bills?  If yes, how much $$ is this?

The customer is not entitled to the credits.  The credits were transferred, then final DA bills calculated and transferred to the customer.  The customer is NOT responsible for these final bills.  Had PG&E not transferred the Enron credits, the final debit bills would have been taken against the credits.

I am a little confused.  Why would the customers be entitled to a credit on bundled service?  EES owns the credits.

Jim,  as far as we know, PG&E is doing this on residential accounts only.  Remember that residential contracts were terminated in May and all accounts returned to utility service.  Instead of using the accumulated credits to clear the final direct access bills, PG&E transferred the credits, then calculated the final amounts.  These debits were then transferred to the customers PG&E bills.  These accounts were NOT reDASRed, so they are no longer Enron customers.  

I have requested a list of all credits transferred from Enron residential customers accounts, plus a listing of direct access bills transferred to these customers.  In the meantime, I feel we need to submit a formal request.

All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent.

Just to make everyone aware there is a database that is now being offered through E-Source, on a trial basis, that monitors country, regulatory, economic, environmental, legal and operational risk for about 185 different countries. The database claims that it helps its users to determine the quality of conditions and level of stability encountered by investors in each country. 
There is a specific Energy Section. That provides information and analysis on country risk, laws and regulations, industry overviews, and breaks down different parts of the countries energy sector. There is also some environmental analysis. The link to this section is:

Thanks Jim.  I will push EPSA as much as I can.  I too don't see how this helps us.  I'm a little annoyed because I think Julie's focus has been primarily on getting better access for generators, and I know she heard the annoyance in my voice when I told her that better generator access is useless for us.  We've been pushing this issue for some time, and we have a lot of marketers in the group, so hopefully we will come to some sort of position that gets us all what we need.

Jim and Christi:

Here is language I proposed to EPSA to be included in ""Standardized Tariffs:""

FERC must eliminate the distinction between network and point to point transmission service and create a new ""Network Plus"" service that is the only firm transmission service offered and is available to all transmission customers.

Julie questions if this is what we really want (we being all of EPSA, including the generators).  Julie is nervous about proposing to eliminate point to point service all together.  She thinks the problem with network is that utilities are preventing generators from getting the service.  I told her that is not our issue, and just changing the rules so that network service is available to generators does not help us.  

Julie suggested language that said something like ""FERC should explore new transmission services for customers.""  I told her that doesn't work -- we need to address this issue head on.  She is concerned that we're going to have dissention within the membership.

How would you all feel about retaining point to point service but making network available to everyone, with a much less restrictive sign up period (e.g. 1 month term rather than 1 year term), etc.  I think its cleaner to eliminate the two types of services and create a new ""Network Plus"" service that's available to everyone -- that would be the ""firm"" service and ""nonfirm"" would continue to exist.  Do you all think we would want to retain point to point service?  Even if we don't, if some EPSA members want to retain point to point service, we may need to think of ways to make network more user-friendly without eliminating point to point.

Let me know what you think

Sarah

Subject:	Government Affairs Organization Announcement


With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to effect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving the company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are by their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of this group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the responsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicated group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard work, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done.

As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along functional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The need to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will jointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to help Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a leadership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electricity will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   Last, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus on California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team).

Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/legislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that will address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate development efforts across the U.S.

Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will continue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahim will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also continue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over support of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Markets, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for South America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Committee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman, Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also continue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry Kingerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am forming a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself.

No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perfect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more prepared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as the future unfolds for the company.

One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our group fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each other and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, for those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excellence and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do all I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the very best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.

We are in the process of calculating EWS's potential short position on green power that could result from an RPS in California. We should have definitive numbers by mid-day tomorrow. We are working with Steve Swain and Jeff Richter to assess the exposure, running our commodity short against $1.50, $3.00 and $7.00 green curves. Numbers will eventually be adjusted for contracts with pass-through clauses. We can discuss the results on our conference call tomorrow.

			Jeff:

			As you may know, at Jim's request, Stacey Bolton reviewed the renewables language in SBX2 79 and SB 532 and identified some important issues. 

			In a memo she sent out yesterday, she detailed her concerns about these bills (copied below, for your reference).  

			How do you suggest we proceed?  Shall I arrange a brief call for us with Stacey, Elliot, Mary and Jesse to discuss where we stand and strategy going forward?

			Jennifer  

			***************
			Overall Concerns:  
				1.	The requirement for retailers to enter into a direct bilateral for the power from renewable energy and schedule it into the CA grid presents limitations and could drive up costs.
				2.	It?s unclear if the REC is truly separate instrument from the underlying commodity.  The above requirement indicates that it is not.  This would negatively impact, and even negate the main reasons to have a REC trading program - to provide flexibility and act as verification for the RPS.
				3.	The biomass definition is too limiting.  Would be difficult to detail this amount of information on a REC.  Need to have language that distinguishes whether the REC is RPS eligible or not.
				4.	Utilities are given preferential treatment in proposed language in that utilities can recover costs through rate base and the Department of Water Resources (SB 532 only) is instructed to purchase renewables on their behalf if it is cost prohibitive for the utilities.
				5.	While the cost cap is positive from a retail perspective, it might be out of the market from a wholesale perspective to cover the renewable premiums for new sources.

					Thanks.  The changes in combination are okay, though it would be better to get the date as Sept '96 for eligibility and interconnected to CA grid.  Also, we still need to work on the REC language (i.e. not mandatorily tied to output power contracts).  What's the best way to approach?  Discuss w/ Jeff Dasovich?

					Also, I wanted to make sure that you have on your radar screen the most recent versions of the bills you analyzed.   I noticed, for example, that in the most recent version of SB 532 (amended on 8/27) there were some important revisions (for example, see highlighted text).

(a) ""Eligible renewable energy resource"" means an electric generating facility or solar thermal energy system that reduces the consumption of electricity through the use of renewable resources and generating facility that meets all of the following criteria: (1) Uses wind, solar, geothermal, or biomass as its primary fuel. (A) A solar thermal energy system that reduces the consumption of electricity may be considered an eligible renewable energy resource. (B) Fuel cells using renewable fuels are an eligible renewable energy resource. (2) Improves the resource diversity in the electricity market that serves the state, and increases the reliability of the state's electricity system. The commission shall deem an electric generating facility or solar thermal energy system to satisfy this requirement if it meets any one of the following criteria: (A) It is located within or interconnected to the control area of the California Independent System Operator, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, or the Imperial Irrigation District. (B) Its power is sold under a direct bilateral contract to a retail seller and its energy is scheduled into the control area of the California Independent System Operator, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, or the Imperial Irrigation District. (C) It meets other fact-based criteria established by the commission. seller and its energy is delivered to end-use customers within the state. (b) ""Eligible existing renewable energy resource"" means an electric generating facility that satisfies all criteria in subdivision (a) and is in existence before January 1, 2001 September 26, 1996 . Any facility that sells its output to an electrical corporation under a contract entered into prior to 1996 under the federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-617) shall be considered an eligible existing resource. (c) ""Eligible new renewable energy resource"" means output from an electric generating facility that satisfies all criteria in subdivision (a) and meets at least one of the following criteria: (1) The facility commenced initial operation on or after January 1, 2001. September 26, 1996. (2) The output represents incremental production from repowered or refurbished existing facilities and project additions completed on or after January 1, 2001 September 26, 1996 , as measured by the production of kilowatthours above the five-year average of the kilowatthours delivered from the project during the five-year period ending December 31, 2000. kilowatthours previously delivered from the project. Incremental output from repowered or refurbished facilities sold to an electrical corporation under a contract entered into prior to January 1, 2001, that specifies fixed capacity payments for the incremental output may not be considered an eligible new renewable energy resource. (3) The output represents incremental output above levels specified in contracts for facilities defined in subdivision (b).

					Also: (c) ""Eligible new renewable energy resource"" means output from an electric generating facility that satisfies all criteria in subdivision (a) and meets at least one of the following criteria: (1) The facility commenced initial operation on or after January 1, 2001.

					The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on

					members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by
					TURN and other consumer groups.

					During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and
					Richard Katz from the Governor?s office regarding a couple of issues
					highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more
					technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently,
					Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff?s request.  D.J. agreed that the bill
					needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA
					contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard about
					it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying
					amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to
					believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too
					self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct
					access.  We suggested that ?shall? be changed to ?may? in order to give more
					leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn?t necessarily oppose
					the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can
					totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do).

					A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to
					push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this
					bill passes.

					There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor?s
					desk.

					The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote on
					additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill.

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a ""public interest"" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and ""load up"" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific ""Christmas tree ornaments.""

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a ""rubber stamp"" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

Subject:	New York regulatory restriccions

As a result of last Monday's gas meeting, today I attended a meeting with Barry Vanderhorst (EES), Paul Tate (EES) and Matthew Fleming (EWS) about the problems we are facing to supply New York State customers.
According to what they explained these problems have two main reasons:
1.	The PUC requirement that marketers should sign an affidavit stating that they have firm transportation to provide firm customers at city gate during winter. 
2.	The LDCs requirement that marketers must supply customers using a transmission mix (60%/40%, 70%/30%, etc) from different pipelines. This requirement prevents marketers from purchasing capacity only from the cheapest pipeline. Marketers are forced to purchase some capacity from expensive pipelines.

We agreed that there are two different cases:
1.	When Enron must use the LDC firm transportation capacity to comply with the PUC requirement. In this case the LDC could argue that they must allocate the FT capacity to free and captive customers with the same mix they have contracted with the different pipelines. If they allocated the cheap capacity to free customers, captive customers could have to pay a higher price, and this could be resisted by the PUC. The validity of this argument depends on the features of the pass through mechanism that is in place in every case.
Unless you know of (or we find out) other reasons, we considered that in these cases we should send a letter to the LDC (eventually with copy to the PUC) asking how was determined the required percentage mix.

2.	When we do not need to use the LDC firm transportation capacity to comply with the PUC requirement. In this case we did not find a clear reason for the LDC to require the marketer to purchase a transportation mix. The marketer is not using the LDC's capacity and should be allowed to reach the city gate from every possible pipeline.
Unless there is a valid reason, in these cases we considered that we should send a letter to the LDC, asking why do they make that requirement, which are their legal foundations, and how was determined the required percentage mix.

They will send me a mail with the mix requirement of every LDC, explaining in which cases we would have to use the LDC capacity.

We also discussed the case of Rochester Gas & Electric. This LDC has a deregulation program that only allocates 10% of their capacity to marketers.  Besides whenever there is an unbalance, part of it is considered as an injection to storage, but the rest is subject to the pipeline's penalties. They considered we need a higher injection right to storage. We agreed to discuss the issue after analyzing the rate schedule involved (SC5).

Melinda and I will look at the PUC regulations to try to find the answers to the above questions before preparing the letters.

Please let me know if this plan is OK with you.
Regards
Guillermo

Subject: Future FERC Involvement and Proposed Schedule for SoutheastRTO


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
BEFORE THE
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

Regional Transmission Organizations	)	Docket No. RT01-100-000

To: Honorable Bobbie J. McCartney:

The Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) has welcomed the opportunity to give you input during the Southeast mediation proceeding.  EPSA and its members would like to thank you and your team for taking time from the proceeding, to share your insights, hear our views, and answer our questions.  We now want to provide you with additional input from generators and marketers in the form of proposed milestones and deadlines regarding continued FERC involvement after the mediation.  We recognize your schedule and hope these brief points will be appropriate prior to your receipt of responses to the strawmen. 

FERC's Continued Involvement
EPSA strongly supports FERC's continued involvement in the development of one Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) for the Southeast.  EPSA believes such continued involvement is critical to achieving RTO market operations in the Southeast as soon as possible.  We cannot overestimate the damage to market efficiency and consumer benefits that result from continued delays to full competition, a problem that plagues the entire country. It was very encouraging to hear of your support for this involvement and desire to get input from market participants regarding how this can be done after the 45-day settlement period has ended.  EPSA would like to make procedural suggestions for the post-mediation period that would include continued Commission involvement that is deemed critical to the formation of a single Southeast RTO.  We hope that the following suggestions are helpful when you are developing your report to the Commission on the mediation results.

The Southeast Power Grid model will be an evolutionary process following the end of the mediation.  Several issue areas are still likely to be the focus of significant debate and will require a collaborative process that the stakeholders will remain responsible for establishing.  Resolving these issues and more importantly, their associated details, will be critical to the enduring success of the eventual Southeast Power Grid.

The Commission's continued involvement is critical to the formation of a seamless power grid.  Additionally, regional market participants can benefit from first-hand FERC input on previous rulings from other regions.  This can help prevent any future Southeast Power Grid filings from attempting to establish rules, protocols, and plans that are contrary to Commission precedent.  Moreover it prevents disagreements between stakeholders on specific points from stalling the process, and potentially resulting in a deficient filing.  Potentially FERC will incur added costs of travel and staff time; however, filings that follow FERC's current thinking will more than offset these costs.

The Commission's presence in the process going forward will prevent any future delay by providing ongoing dialogue between regulators and market participants.  This will shortcut the time-consuming sequence of: (1) internal negotiations; (2) filing; (3) filing response and, hopefully, obviate the need for going through the sequence repeatedly.  FERC presence will also help prevent parties from becoming polarized in their views during negotiations without feeling a need to compromise. 

Future stakeholder meetings in the Southeast Power Grid process will work best by involving two FERC staff representatives and to avoid ex-parte concerns, EPSA recognizes that any meeting attended by Commission staff must be publicly noticed. These Commission staff representatives need to be knowledgeable of the Southeast process and can serve as back-ups to one another.  Consequently if a situation arises where one staffer cannot participate in a meeting, the alternate should be able to stand in as a proxy for the other Commission representative.

The mediation process will have its value increased if the Commission's staff representatives are empowered to correct procedural problems that emerge in the process as it moves forward.  For example, if the Commission's staff finds that meeting minutes do not reflect stakeholder decisions or consensus on a given issue or they are not being disseminated to process participants in a systematic manner, they can ensure that problems are rectified.  Making expedient changes as the subsequent process unfolds after the 45-day mediation period is over will confirm that the successes of the mediation continue and that parties continue to work collaboratively.  

Staff involvement will give the Commission the ability to monitor the process during the post-mediation period.  If questions arise during post-mediation period, staff can supply on-the-spot answers or coordinate with senior staff to get answers to the parties quickly.  The efficiency of this established feedback channel ensures that negotiations between parties do not bog down and hinder the completion of the overall process over a single issue.  Moreover, the presence of Commission staff assists in maintaining a cooperative approach between the parties, as is evidenced in our mediation process.

Having Commission representatives in the field for the Southeast Power Grid process can prove valuable as a way for FERC to continue to engage state public utility commissions and remain responsive to their concerns as details about the Grid organization get refined.  The involvement of state commissions is integral to the success of more competitive wholesale markets in the Southeast.  A FERC presence going forward will allow federal and state regulators to confer on the benefits to consumers of successful competitive wholesale and, ultimately, retail power markets.  State regulators' comfort level could be increased if the process continues with an ongoing FERC presence.  

Proposed Milestones and Deadlines
The following schedule still assumes some form of convergence between the existing structures.  EPSA continues to believe that a single Southeast RTO can be formed in a timely manner, that will provide certainty to the market, steadily reduce business risks for those who have and will invest in the Southeast, and provide consumers with the quickest path to a cost-effective market structure * all while maintaining the reliability of the existing system.

		Sept.6, 2001	Begin post mediation process and resume RTO development

Sept. 30, 2001	Section 205 Filing consistent with mediation settlement reached

Oct.1, 2001	Start stakeholder input process: identification or Advisory Committee establishment

Nov.1, 2001- Dec. 31, 2001	Start and complete selection of Board, immediately followed by selection of Market/System Administrator

Dec. 15, 2001	Filing with Commission on completed consensus
(Order 2000 op. date)	documents and status report

Feb.1, 2002	File with Commission any outstanding organic documents

Mar.1, 2002	Market Monitor Selection process completed

Apr. 2002	Commission Response 	 

Mar.- Jun. 2002	Asset Transfers, Staff established

Jun. 2002	RTO becomes operational, with Day 1 market system

Dec. 15, 2002	Day 2 market system implemented
(Order 2000 Requirement)

We appreciate your taking the time to hear our suggestions.  We have great confidence in your command over these proceedings and that they will lead to a single competitive market for power in the Southeast.

The Governor's Energy Working Groups' subcommittee on merchant plants will take comments from independent suppliers on October 18th.  TVA made a presentation at the last meeting of the subcommittee.  I will forward to you an outline of their comments.

Please take a look at them and provide me with comments on how you think the industry should respond and who you think should do it (i.e. should we have EPSA testify, a panel of industry experts, etc...).  I will be on the EPSA call Friday afternoon.

For those of you who are not aware, Enron has site near Memphis that it is developing.  The air permit application was submitted prior to the Chief of Staff's letter advising local air boards to not accept new permits.  We tentatively believe that our permit can go forward w/o holdup.   While our site might be spared, we need to take into consideration the fact that the state could take action to severely limit independent power projects in TN.  This action could result in a domino effect in the south.  Also, this meeting provides us with an opportunity to bring our message regarding TVA into Tennessee.

I will also obtain a copy of the subcommittee's members and forward it to you.

Also, Robert Gowan of Stokes Bartholomew, one of our law firms in TN, is talking with the head of the EWG about getting EPSA appointed to the Advisory Board of the Working Group.

I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our ""positive"" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their ""goofy"" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  

Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.

Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.

Jeff,

Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our ""contribution"" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the ""netting"" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to take

however, that decision has not been made because several Legislators have
indicated that they may not be in Sacramento tomorrow.

The Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee is going to meet sometime today
off the floor to take up SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott) which would establish a
windfall profits tax.  Additional amendments will be taken that will make
the tax effective on January 1, 2002, define exempt wholesale generator,
marketer, broker, and aggregator, by referencing their PUC definitions, and
exempt QFs.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee will meet upon
adjournment of session today to take up SBX2 39, which would give the CPUC
regulatory authority over non-IOU generation facilities, for
reconsideration.  The bill failed passage during its prior hearing.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee is scheduled to take
up the following bills on September 4 at 1:30 p.m.:

SBX2 85 (Burton) - This bill would prevent the CPUC, upon termination of the
10 percent rate reduction for residential and small commercial customers set
forth in subdivision (a) of Section
368, from subjecting those residential and small commercial customers to any
rate increases or future rate obligations solely as a result of the
termination of the 10 percent rate reduction.

SBX2 18 (Burton) - This bill would establish a dedicated rate component.

Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money.
The call was short and ended with an agreement that:
	1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 
	2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 
	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.

Subject:	SCE

The Assembly working group on ABX2 82 is preparing new amendments based on
yesterday's meetings.  The amendments will make 82 look even more like the
Senate bill than the previous version.  Direct access will remain in 82 with
some supposedly minor modifications.  DA will be authorized effective in
January 2002 at the sole discretion of the CPUC with some non-bypassable
charge.  There is still no number for the core/non-core dividing line.  The
Democrats still face obstacles within their own party and it is unclear if
they have the votes to pass this proposal.  They expect no support from
Republicans.

Assemblyman Keeley is going to meet with the following Senators today and
tomorrow to see if the Senate is willing to budge at all; Burton, Sher,
Bowen, Dunn and Peace.  The Assembly is not sure if they will bring up the
bill if they do not reach consensus with the Senate.

Subject: RE: ICAP


Trust me, I believe a single energy price is best for the market.  But I still don't get why our espousing the platitudes of spot market pricing automatically make it right.  I think a theoretically sound argument can be made around separate energy and capacity pricing where the capacity price is more stable but over time achieves exactly the same result for generators as a spot price would.  But we do nothing to refute this other model other than call on Thor to curse the icap gods.   Admittedly, part of my reaction is my own ignorance of our needs and history but I wonder how much of our view is religion and how much is commercially motivated, especially when at least from the retail view there are solutions which preserve some semblance of ""icap"" but yet make it workable for retail competition.

I know.  Anyway, the single most important issue from the perspective of Retail seems to be ""daily granularity"".  We need to be able to adjust our daily obligation based on customer switching patterns.  These can occur at any time.  So any thing that locks in our capacity requirement for a long period of time (months to a year or more) can be a killer.  
 
A specific model we discussed was ""operating capacity"".  This takes the operating reserves concept and blows it up to a full capacity market equivalent.  ISO administers the market.  Generators commit capacity to energy market or reserve market, but not both.  Long term deals possible as well as real time market.  Lots has to be flushed out but it seems like a viable approach. 
 
Will discuss more on Wednesday.  Have talked briefly with Luiz about this.

Enron can never take the position that ICAP is good!  I don't know why Stoness is trying to undertake more analysis.  His reasoning that ICAP is ""complicated"" and we do well at complications is crazy given the EES business model - Enron Direct.

Subject: FW: ICAP






[Kingerski, Harry]  We can meet today at 2 pm in room 4746 to discuss more about Retail's view of ICAP and related issues.   

  
  

Scott Stoness' summary of our meeting yesterday with Dale Furrow, his regional leads, and Narsimha Misra: 

The gist of the meetings was: 

1) Pro ICAP was: 

Pragmatically, high energy costs are bad because they delay competition.  ICAP is therefore good because it reduces the high price periods with market intervention. 
Pragmatically, ICAP is complicated, and complicated translucent rules favor the bright (Enron). 
Mathematically, 2 separate markets - Capacity and Energy - should result in the same outcome.  ie. Energy costs should reduce to exactly offset the increase in demand charges. 
Theorectically, if the market expects the government to intervene in the event of high power costs, suppliers will build less capacity than needed.  Given that this is inevitable (government intervention), we might as well intervene now as later. 
Theorectically, market failure is probable because small customers are not able to internalize the costs of not hedging, causing them to take more risk than they should.  Given that the customers are not making the right societal decision, we should make it for them 


2) Pro Not ICAP was: 

Any artificial price determination will distort the market causing inefficiencies.  ie. a fixed ICAP for 12 months will favor a technology available all year round. ie2. ICAP could cause environmental damage by causing CT's to be built instead of Combined Cycle. 
ICAP, with market, is complicated which will decrease market efficiencies 
Market prices, with financial firm obligations, will result in a continuous balance of supply and demand 
Market prices, will result in much more efficiency because they cause more demand side response. 


Conclusion: 

There was no consensus.  There seemed to be more people on the no ICAP side than the ICAP side.  Basically comes down to i) economics suggests ICAP is inefficient, vs ii) lack of ICAP will damage competition. 
We agreed that if ICAP is inevitable, we should advocate, market determined ICAP's 
We agreed that, given that this issue is controversial, and that Narshima has the largest interests.  He should head up our response.

Jose

We will discuss this on the 2:30 pm call Tues.

I think what NERC needs to know is that their job is not done. Big issues were tied into the Stakeholder's recommendation - changes in governance, voting, funding.  The idea of expanding NERC's role is not for the sole purpose of getting NERC to develop business practices - but rather get NERC to recognize the market and commercial needs in its reliability rules.  Presently, NERC focuses on reliability rules and considers commercial impacts as a secondary issue.  This is what the Stakeholders wish to change.  We must make sure that message is not misconstrued by spin-doctors.

To ensure, this, the charter of NERC would need to change and the idea of a Self-Regulated Organization should cease.

Jose and Charles
Given the actions taken by the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board
last week, we need to take steps to broaden stakeholder support and
endorsement of these recommendations, especially the one dealing with
NERC taking on an expanded role for the development of business practice
standards in addition to reliability standards.

At the FERC panel discussion last Thursday on standardizing business
practices, it was pretty clear that FERC is not going to make this call,
but rather leave it up to the industry to decide who assumes this
responsibility. In this regard, we would welcome the support of Enron
and EPSA.

Give me a call when you can so we can discuss where Enron is on this,
and how you might help gain EPSA's support.

Thanks.
dave

PS - I still remember that at the 1995 FERC Technical Conference on
OASIS it was Rick Shapiro who first spoke up in response to Betsy
Moler's question about who should take on the responsibility for
developing OASIS standards. Maybe Enron wants to be the first one to
publicly endorse the ""New NERC"" as the one-stop shop for wholesale
electric standards.

Not quite sure who/what ponderosa is but we have sandhill Austin of which we control 100 MW thru Oct 03. We also have assorted asset management deals but they amount to advisory roles. We did have a deal in the works with the Cleburne Facility that was formerly owned by Tenaska. Carl Tricoli is your man on that one.

Met with Charles yesterday and outlined what I saw as needs and opportunities. He said he will be getting back to you on it.

Take care,

Doug

Subject:	Merger Analysis - ERCOT Market Share
Importance:	High

I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  

The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?
  
Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?  
Do we have any construction in progress?  
Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?

Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?

Thanks,

Jim

See attached.  Crazy Commissioner (Carl Wood) at the PUC is now trying to require folks to submit their DA contracts to the PUC (everyone refused the first time he ""asked"").  Customers are going to get very cranky about this.  Likely to be a pretty pitched battle.  I'm contacting the large customers to see what they intend to do.  Can't see them going down without a fight. We should plan on discussing with Mike Day first thing on Wednesday morning, if folks are available. Please forward to anyone else who needs it.
Best,
Jeff

Hi Jim -
I sent Mari an email at home about a position that came up here.  We just
had a guy in our regulatory group leave - his position is much below
anything that you would consider, but given the vacancy, they may be able
to create a higher level position for you.  At this point I am really just
seeing if you would even consider talking to our folks and I haven't
presented it to anyone over here either.  Just thought I would bring it up
considering the situation over there.  If you have some interest maybe we
could set up lunch sometime soon.
By the way congrats on the baby.  Maybe it will be a boy this time.

I have drafted a detailed outline on our receivables due from the underscheduling penalty.  Because the penalty has not been implemented by the CAISO, our case needs to clearly lay out the CAISO has failed to implement FERC orders and what our receivable is even though we have no invoices to rely on.

The biggest ""to dos"" on this are: (1) update our receivable amount to the extent we can get more data from CAISO (we have asked for data informally from CAISO), (2) lodge discovery questions re: the computation of our receivable (I drafted questions in Section 5), and (3) review Enron's past positions on this matter.

I am assuming that sections 1. and 2. will go in our pleading and/or policy testimony and that sections 3. AND 4. will be beefed up and/or updated by Murray O'Neil (with help from Stokley and Blair).  

I am on vacation from 8/11//01 - 8/24/01 so please look at this ASAP so that I can answer any questions before I leave.

1) I received E-mail that they may talk tonite about their right to to terminate, but the intention given no news was to continue forward ""90% probability""
2) Ed Munoz, Raytheon Reg Affairs, stated yesterday that his sources believed yesterday that if the PUC acted today, 9/15 would have been the date
3) While on the phone with me, Jennifer Stone (attorney) received an e-mail from CMTA's Dorothy Rothrock (please see below, lists major CMTA members being fed the CMTA Line) regarding expected CPUC & Legislative actions 
4) Facility Mgmt view is that ""state/DWR fuel costs could escalate if military actions occur and that Enron contract is a hedge to this volatility""
5) Raytheon has been notified we are not forwarding the Petition just Yet, ""fine"" I would feel better sending it in next week directly to Raytheon VP Legal after polish
6) Several of the Team members of Raytheon will be out tomorrow & next week, I doubt a week extension would give them much more comfort, but would probably be a nice to have.
7) Attorneys are still concerned about exit fees even if date is 9/1 or beyond, but they knew this throughout our contract negotiations and expect fees to not exceed savings

TO: CMTA Energy Committee
FROM:      Dorothy Rothrock
SUBJECT: Legislative Update

As of this morning, we have not seen language from the Senate to replace
the SBX2 78 that passed out of the Assembly last week.  Rumors are that the
elements of SBX2 78 will be broken apart into separate bills, put into
Assembly bills now in the Senate, and sent over to the Assembly for
concurrence today or tomorrow.  There will probably be a hearing in Senate
Energy this afternoon on the issues.

We have been working to gain bipartisan support for direct access, assuming
that it will be pulled from the MOU and run as a separate bill, if at all.
It is likely that direct access as a stand alone issue does not have the
votes because of concerns about small customer opposition and a big
business ""jail break.""  Our only chance is a coalition of Republicans and
moderate Democrats that requires the CPUC to suspend direct access, letting
customers currently on direct access maintain (and renew) their contracts,
and hopefully preserving the right for future direct access without fees if
there is net short.  Given the short time we have left, and that we have no
leverage if the issue is separate from the SCE MOU, I fear this is a long
shot.

In the absence of legislation to overturn ABX1 1, the CPUC will probably
suspend direct access later this month.  The proposed decision would leave
open ""the effect to be given to contracts signed before today, including
renewals of such contracts"" to a later decision. (Draft proposed decision
issued September 6, 2001, not yet acted upon.)

The other information at this time is that the Senate will propose MOU
language similar to what originally went over to the assembly in SBX2 78 -
a cut-off for paying SCE debt of greater than 20kw (probably 100kw and
over) and no direct access.  SCE has previously stated that this is
insufficient to allow them to issue bonds, thus no creditors could be paid
and bankruptcy would follow.  CMTA will oppose an MOU bill that proposes a
disproportionate spread of the debt without any counterbalancing value to
us such as direct access.

Another piece of this puzzle is the Renewable Portfolio Standard  (SB 532)
that was attached to the SBX2 78 in order to gain some Democrat support in
the Assembly.  SB 532 bill got stuck in assembly U&C, but will come over
from the Senate in another bill.  CMTA worked to get some improvements in
this bill, including a procedure that could lower the cost cap from 1.5
cents and in exchange withdrew opposition.  We are NOT in support. My guess
is that this bill could pass in the Assembly, and I wanted to make it
""better."" The other business groups have not yet determined their
positions.

I will call Pam with updates to share with you in the next few days.

Following up on our conversation last night, Linda was right (I have to eat some crow!), but the RTO-related tax changes were in fact included in the tax title of the energy package reported by the House Ways and Means Committee and included in the omnibus energy package that was approved last night.  Specifically, the tax provisions would (1) address the ""private use"" issue that could otherwise be detrimental to the municipal bonds of public power entities and (2) address the tax consequences of a transfer of transmission assets from an IOU to an RTO (current law would make this a taxable event, the bill would let the IOU reinvest the proceeds in other utility property, liberally defined, and thus defer the tax.  In sum, on both counts, this is what EEI and APPA had negotiated.  The ball is now in the Senate's court on these tax issues. Given this movement on these tax issues, they should not be used as insurmountable hurdles in the RTO process.

We have hard copies of the relevant statutory language and explanatory materials for your use.   I will get them to each when you are next in the office ""between RTO rounds"" at FERC.

	I wanted to give you an update for the first of the month.  Almost everything is updated, except for the California issues, which I assume you already have more information than I do.  I have had a difficult time getting a hold of anyone out there.  Montovano's information will be updated as soon as I get it.  If you like, we can discuss this at 5:00 when we meet.

Diann,

Your billing dispute has been reviewed and SCE has determined that all
charges were correctly calculated. New accounts were established as a
result of the change in direct access status and financial relationship and
all amounts are properly due and owing.

Please feel free to contact your Account Manager Matt Pagano should you
require assistance with regard to payment.  These bills are due and payable
and subject to further collection activity which may include Late Payment
Charges and/or reversion to dual billing if they remain unpaid.

Janet,

With reference to the bills listed on the attached, pursuant to Rule 22 and
Rule
10A we are disputing that any charges are properly due and owing on these
accounts.  Each of these accounts has a credit balance.  We are therefore
withholding payment.

See attached.  Crazy Commissioner (Carl Wood) at the PUC is now trying to require folks to submit their DA contracts to the PUC (everyone refused the first time he ""asked"").  Customers are going to get very cranky about this.  Likely to be a pretty pitched battle.  I'm contacting the large customers to see what they intend to do.  Can't see them going down without a fight. We should plan on discussing with Mike Day first thing on Wednesday morning, if folks are available. Please forward to anyone else who needs it.

       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair

            Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: 10/16/01

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on NYISO and Con Ed Requests to
      Extend AMP and LMM
      ? Filings Due on Friday, October 19th

The New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) and Con Ed have again made requests to extend both the Automated Mitigation Procedures (AMP) and the revised localized market-power mitigation measures  (LMM) until October 31, 2002.  Once again, EPSA has drafted a protest, arguing that the use of price correction mechanisms result in unintended, yet harmful, consequences on the market such as limiting market entry, slowing the development of risk mitigation tools, and undermining demand-side response.  EPSA's also stresses that yet another extension of the provisions, intended to address flaws in the start-up of the market two years ago, is unwarranted.

Please review the draft and forward any comments or suggestions to Erin Perrigo at EPSA at 202-628-8200 or eperrigo@epsa.org by noon on Thursday, October 18th so that we can make a timely filing by Friday.

"RE: RTO Comments","My thoughts --

1.	Great job.
2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  
3.	Thanks for getting in ""Network Plus"" - it's the little things that matter.
4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.

The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.

There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please ""Reply to All"" so everyone receives your comments.  

Thanks for everyone's help.

Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide ""Adequate Assurances of Payment"", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.

Give me a call (35676).  most of the customer's we are currently engaged with, have very little load behind the non-ERCOT utilities.  however, do not have a feel for future prospects. 

 Question, is this an opportunity to force the utilities to implement pro-dereg measures (i.e., to the PUC, why else would it work behind other utilities and not here?).

Subject:	Physical Delivery in SPP

The Staff of the PUCT has filed a petition to determine whether the market institutions and participants are ready for competition in the Texas portion of SPP (SERC), namely Entergy Gulf States, SWEPCO,  and WTU power regions, copies attached.  Staff has also requested the PUCT to suspend the capacity auction for Entergy and SWEPCO but not for WTU.  The petition requests the PUCT to make the determination at the November 1, 2001, meeting and to suspend the capacity auction at the August 23, 2001, meeting.

In support of their petition, staff argues that there has been limited participation in the SERC region, based on an ""informal survey"" of the staff.  Staff also explains that the FERC has not yet approved a RTO for the SERC region (SPP).  Staff is concerned that if auction of capacity results in a low price, this will have a detrimental effect of the affiliated REPs headroom under the price to beat determination as it is all tied to the price of capacity at the auction.  In addition, staff is concerned if Entergy or SWEPCO sells 15% of their capacity and are required to serve 100% of their load.  The staff has not requested a delay in the WTU capacity auction due to the fact that the WTU capacity is located in ERCOT and WTU's relatively small load. 

In order to prepare for filing comments, if neccessary, Enron Government Affairs would like to know the following:
1)  Does EES/EWS have signed contracts for physical delivery in Entergy, SWEPCO or  WTU?
2)  What amount of load do we have contracted in each utility within SPP?
3)  It appears that SPP will not open and no RTO will be in place on 1/1/02.  Therefore, is EWS prepared to operate in SPP under the existing control area structure?

Please forward your responses to Thane Twiggs and myself.  Also, please feel free to contact either of us if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Dear Jim, 
 
Sometime within the past week you may have received a catalogue that  describes Xenergy's Multi-Client Research offerings for 2001. In case it  did not reach you, I have attached a pdf version for your convenience. The  catalogue gives an overview of the various core and companion studies that  Xenergy is currently working on. The REM 2001 program is described on page  2. I have attached a REM 2001 powerpoint presentation to better  explain our work.  The slides go into more depth about the current status  of retail energy markets (slides 1-22), and then where things stand with  the research that is underway.  Do let me know if you'd like more  information about the REM 2001 study and I will be happy to arrange a conference  call with Taff Tschamler, one of the key people involved with this  project.  The final meeting for sponsors will be held Feb 25 -27, 2002 at  the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin Texas.  Aside from hearing about the final  study results, this meeting is an excellent opportunity to meet informally  with all of our Retail Energy Market sponsors. 
 
I will check back with you in a week or so to see if you have  questions.  
Thanks very much for your time.

"FERC Gas Dockets","Suzanne --

Becky Cantrell had entered Enron into a number of dockets before FERC related to pipeline rate and other matters (not sure if there were protests).  I would greatly appreciate you coming over to 47 and going through a number of filings so we can either (a) stay in the case or (b) remove our name as an active party.  Elizabeth Linnell has the papers on 47.

My initial thought is that Enron does not need to continue in these cases, but the NewCo will want to understand what to join after formation.  We may want to talk with commercial types to gauge their thoughts.

Please let me know if you can take care of this.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: RTO case studies and analysis -- Update

I spoke with Seabrom Adamson and Kevin Wollenus (sp?) about a cost/benefit study.  Seab said that they are not set up to do a detailed modeling analysis, but that Tabors has the programs already set up and could probably do some type of a modeling analysis.  However, we discussed what other type of study we could do, and we came up with a few ideas.

Seab said that there are general benefits to RTO formation:  e.g., transmission expansion (although you still have siting problems, RTOs will build new transmission where it is needed); administrative cost savings; savings from reserve sharing.  We also discussed the arguments of the cheap power states.  For example, many of the southeastern states oppose RTOs because they fear losing their low cost power.  But Seab points out that RTOs do not mean that the states ""lose"" their low cost power.  The PSCs retain their authority to decide whether their utilities can or cannot sell power from their plants to third parties.  The PSCs can prohibit utilities from exporting low cost power if it is needed to serve local retail customers.  Seab thought this response to a potential ""cost"" of RTOs could also be worked into the analysis.

Seab and Kevin are going to give the issue more thought and put together a proposal.  The problem is timing.  Seab has California testimony due on November 6 and he expects to be tied up with that for the next 2 weeks.  If we use the cost/benefit study as part of our NOPR comments (due end of Nov - mid Dec), then he will have enough time.  If we want to present a study before that time (perhaps with comments on RTO week), he will not be able to do the work.  Seab will have a proposal by COB tomorrow or perhaps Monday morning.

I have a call in to Tabors to discuss the same proposal with him.

Larry Ruff is on vacation this week.  He's back on Monday.  We can call him then.

Rick, you also named a few other people:  Charles Stallon, Eric Wolchek, the Brattle Group.  Should I put calls in to these people as well?  Let me know.

I am going through all of my notes and testimony from the hearings to put together a list of issues like this that we need to address.  The best way to do this in a disciplined, orderly manner is to start with Sarah and other regulatory folks here and also share a list of these issues with folks in Houston to figure out the best way to respond in short order.  Pat is correct that the ""no studies"" point was a common refrain from Southern and others at the House RTO hearing yesterday.

A point floating out there that we need to bat down: There are no studies or analysis showing cost-benefit on RTOs.  Is that true?  If it's false, can we get copies of the pro-RTO studies that exist?

Mike Grigsby and Scott Neal both agree that they don't have any objection to intraday recall as long as it is an option that the releasing shipper can select as part of the initial release and they would know up front if a package they were bidding on was recallable mid-day - just another product which they would price accordingly.  Leslie thinks the optionality of it is contained in the order, but we'll file comments requesting clarification since it's not addressed head-on.

I reviewed the EPSA filing, and I have no problems, but Becky is going to run it by the desk to make sure it is okay with them.  Becky and I have been talking about what we will file and I plan to work on that today and tomorrow, but here is the thumbnail of it.

FERC is trying in the rule to give intraday recall rights to releasing shippers.   If this applies to all transactions, it obviously devalues and degrades capacity releases.  The proper approach is let the parties negotiate the arrangements they want and for the payment to reflect the level of firmness actually given.  In other words, if a releasing shipper wants the recall rights that FERC would give them as a matter of law in this rule, then they spell those rights out in their posting and negotiate the deal with that on the table.  If a shipper is willing to release capacity and forego any recall rights, they should be able to do this, and receive payment that reflects the nature of that service.  But having a rule that mandates recall that cannot be negotiated is uncalled for and contrary to the purposes of capacity release and open access.

I have started to work with Jim Wilfong in EES who seems a bit more organized and he is mastering the tariff's ins and outs and getting a handle on the gas pricing going forward.  Once a customer returns to sales service, it must stay there for a least one year and must give a year's notice (as I recall) before it can return to transportation.  And until we have a final solution to our delivery problems, I don't think EES will take any customers back.  We are working on that both at FERC and the ACC.

FYI. Apparently we turned back sales customers in Arizona served by Southwest Gas but we are still on the hook for their gas costs.  Altho I was in contact with EES virtually daily since December on about the SW problems, I was told that we were able to terminate their contracts, and was not aware of the lingering exposure issue on pricing until I started getting emails last week.  Needless to say I am not pleased and EES is trying to find a regulatory fix to this problem.  If I had known about it last winter, I would have been able to explain it to them.  I don't think I can get this fixed, and they should have kept the customers, as the delivery problems cleared up in the spring.

Subject:	RE: Southwest Gas 

On cash-outs, Southwest takes the highest price paid for any incremental volume and applies it to all cash out volumes.  This is the issue we took up at the ACC and argued that it should be based on actual costs, not the single highest price.  BUT this is a different issue than the actual cost of gas for sales purposes.  I would think that the sales gas is based on actual incremental costs.  There is a possibility this can be audited, but we would have to go to the ACC, and as in California, they will not be at all sympathetic to us. They will view this an Enron problem.  I just say that so that you don't think that I can fix this easily (I doubt that I can fix this at all, but let's see what we get from the ACC on the cash out issue, that will be a good indicator.  We were clearly right on that one).

Is there any way to know what their incremental cost of gas is or how it is calculated?  For example, if SW Gas buys 10,000 MMBtu total for the month at $5.00 and all other purchases were at $3.00, and EES' sales gas for that month was 90,000 MMBtu, can they charge $5.00 for all 90,000?  Are there any audit rights?  Also, I heard that we hired a law firm awhile back to address this issue???  Do you know anything about that or what they did/accomplished?  You may be hearing more about this from Don Black or Jess Hewitt--there is a huge concern about our exposure this winter.

"RE: Govt Affairs Org Chart","Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

"FERC Reporting Requirements for California Natural Gas Sales","John & Louise --

I wanted to make sure that you were aware that FERC has ordered natural gas sellers to provide monthly reporting for transactions relating to California.  We are, of course, seeking for FERC to modify its decision.  Given the politics surrounding California energy markets, it is unlikely that FERC remove in whole the reporting obligation.  Govt Affairs has talked with the West gas team about this new obligation and how we respond.

If you have any questions, please call.

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

Yep - in fact, they did.  I just haven't got around to summarizing the order yet.  Here's some excerpts:

""We reach no determination regarding whether PG&E Transmission's system-wide cost of fuel will increase above the current cost, since the outcome depends on numerous factors, such as the total pipeline volumes transported and the price of fuel.  Instead, as discussed below, and in accordance with Enron's request [way to go, FERC!!], we will act to insulate existing shippers from increased fuel costs attributable to the proposed expansion.""

After suggesting that it would have been more appropriate to calculate fuel costs by using the average of the latest twelve months of actual data in place of the theoretical maximum rate, FERC directed ""PG&E Transmission to design a surcharge to ensure that expansion shippers are subject to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above the costs attributable to fuel absent the proposed addition of 97,500 horsepower of compression.  In addition, PG&E must indicate compliance with this condition whenever it files to adjust its compressor fuel surcharge and whenever it files its annual gas fuel reimbursement reports.""

Subject:	Kern River 2002 Expansion Project (CP01-31)

According to the Draft Order that was voted out at the Commission meeting today, the subject project, as amended to reflect the approval of the California Action Project, is approved, subject to certain conditions including restrictions on rolled-in rate treatment.  

The Commission was concerned that the additional fuel costs could exceed the rate reduction to existing shippers.  Kern River's projections were based on a $3.00/dth cost of gas.  The Commission conditioned its approval of rolled-in rate treatment by providing that, ""in its future compliance tariff filing to roll-in the costs and lower transmission rates, Kern River must submit revised exhibits showing the excess revenues over the incremental cost-of-service, and the net benefits after anticipated fuel costs are considered"" (Kern River's settlement in RP99-274 requires it to reduce its rates for existing customers coincident with the in-service date for newly certificated facilities if it receives approval for rolled-in rate treatment).  Additionally, if during any year, the combined level of the electric and gas fuel expenses exceed the benchmark level(s) of excess revenues established in the tariff filing, then Kern River must allocate the excess portion of fuel costs to its expansion shippers.  Thus, Kern River must always assure that this expansion does not increase costs for existing shippers.

The Commission rejected concerns of the existing firm shippers as well as SoCal Gas about the potential for additional curtailment at Wheeler Ridge.  The Commission found that the potential for increased curtailment did not warrant rejection or modification of Kern River's proposal, in part because SoCal Gas does not offer firm service on its system and therefore existing shippers have never had any assurance that Socal Gas would accept their gas.  

The Draft Order is 49 pages long.  Please advise if you would like a hard copy.

Do we have a strong preference for what DSTAR utilities should do?  I think that we want to communicate with OMTR and others at FERC to push a single RTO in the West (leaving CA) outside.  Also, having the Transco originally within the RTO West makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the Transco.

To All,

Below is a message from Jack King the Chair of the DSTAR Board, which describes the dissolution of the DSTAR board due to the withdrawal of funding from the PTOs in the region.

The information I received on Wednesday from Cary Deise of APS was, on Monday the PTOs voted to withdraw funding of DSTAR (as noted below).  The big 5 in the region, APS, TEPCo, PNM, SRP and WAPA have, or plan, on signing a Memorandum Of Understanding to file with FERC on October 12 a complete tariff to form a for-profit TransCo called WesCo, or WestTrans, which will be based on the documents that we have been reviewing.  Cary noted that there are several possibilities for the proposed TransCo, one was to join TransConnect in the northwest and join RTO West, simply join RTO West, or develop their own compliant RTO.  Below Jack King states that the PTOs would be forming a for-profit RTO, that was NOT the impression I got from APS.  

I will keep you posted of any developments.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.

Kind Regards,

Dave

"AEP & Texas Retail Competition","Guys -- 

We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform). 

AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).

Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.

You are probably already aware but if not, Enron holds an interest in Project Cornhusker (a QF in Cleburne).  There are some issues that may develop with the plant related to its ability or inability to meet specific ERCOT guidelines.  Generation Investments is managing this asset and relations with Brazos Co-op. Their primary concern is that Mirant is Brazos Co-op's QSE and may be interested in playing games with the plant through modification of ERCOT rules.

Subject: CPUC Initiating Rulemaking on ""Integrated Resource Planning""
Importance: High


The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
""retirement.""

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to ""integrated resource
planning.""  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.

Subject: highlights from CPUC meeting
Importance: High


FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress,
with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.

CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to ""integrated resource planning""
with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited
Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates
utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for
life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset
construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission,
etc.

CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for
reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re
economic projects.

CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract
amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision
based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions
could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties
remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on
ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract
amendments with SCE's.

CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation.
PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set
cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but
notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that
CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained
assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that
require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC
settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered
per that agreement.

There are materials of the Trans-elect website that details the CMS purchase,  http://www.trans-elect.com/. Under a Q&A section is the following:

Q: Will Trans-Elect put the METC transmission system in an RTO?
A: Yes, in accordance with FERC requirements that all systems must join an RTO.
Q: Which RTO will Trans-Elect choose?
A: Either the Midwest Independent System Organization (MISO) or the Alliance will be selected. Trans-Elect has 40 days from the announcement to make a selection. Trans-Elect is assessing the two organizations to make a determination as to which one will best serve the interests of Michigan consumers.

Looks like there was substance to the Consumers energy rumour.  Consumers are currently part of Alliance, the fact that the new owner wanted to make a decision on RTOs suggests that they are moving to MISO (they would have looked at the ARTO structure as part of due diligence).  Will let you know when the decision is made.

Howard, Kathleen, & Steve --

Can we sit down and discuss our strategies going forward in light of this RD?  I'd like to understand where there are opportunities (both for POLR outsourcing and standard market entry).  I don't think that there will ever be a huge surplus in generation (and there shouldn't be in a competitive market).  Instead of focusing on something the NYPSC can't control, why not work on demand responsiveness?  Better metering technology would certainly help.

Let me know when a good time would be?

Subject:	Highlights of the Recommended Decision in NY's Energy Competition Case

Sarah,
I've attached an article from today's Megawatt Daily regarding NY's generic energy competition case.  I've also attached a summary of the RD written by Kevin Brocks, our NESPA Counsel.  As you can see, the RD dismisses aggressive migration measures until wholesale markets are functioning better.  Furthermore, the RD states that until supplies increase and markets stabilize, ratepayers must be protected.  In addition, a PSC official is quoted as saying that it ""will be another three to four years until there is sufficient supply in the state to allow for workably competitive markets, and that it could be at least 10 years before retail competition is viable.""  

Is there anything in the RTO Order or your participation thus far in the mediation process that could refute the claim that it will be 3 or 4 years until there is sufficient supply in NY to allow for workably competitive markets?
-Kathleen

MegawattDaily
New York PSC draft report sees competition in 3-4 years

New York regulatory staff expects
comments tomorrow on a recom-mended
decision about the future of
competitive power market development
in the state.
The recommended decision, issued
last month by two administrative law
judges for the state Public Service Com-mission
and a PSC official (00-M-0504),
says it will be another three to
four years until there is sufficient supply
in the state to allow for workably com-petitive
markets, and that it could be at
least 10 years before retail competition
is viable.
Two principal problems in transi-tioning
to a competitive market are
inelastic supply and demand, both of
which are inherent in energy markets, the
proposed decision, issued last month,
says. Until supply consistently exceeds
demand by a certain margin, the PSC
must play a prominent role in the state's
power markets.
""Markets characterized by largely
inelastic supply and demand where
demand is approaching or is equal to
supply are not workably competitive and
will not produce just and reasonable
rates,"" the recommended decision says.
""Until supplies increase, ratepayers
should be provided some measure of
protection from those markets. Once
supply exceeds demand sufficiently to
eliminate the exercise of excessive mar-ket
power, the markets can become
workably competitive and will likely
produce just and reasonable rates.""
The recommended decision goes on
to warn, ""Unrealistic expectations con-cerning
the timing of market develop-ment
(either too long or too short) can
have serious consequences to the public,
and can, in the extreme, result in the
worst of all possible outcomes - the
creation of an unregulated monopoly.
""If competition is assumed to
develop very rapidly and wholesale
market prices are imposed on customers
without regulatory intervention and
from a market that is not workably com-petitive,
higher prices and rates that do
not meet the statutory standard of just
and reasonable are likely. On the other
hand, if a long transition is assumed and
significant regulatory control continues
to be exercised over prices, competition
and its benefits could be stifled indefi-nitely.""
In March 2000, the PSC initiated
the proceeding to examine the state's
progress toward competitive markets. It
sought information on the difficulties
that have emerged, lessons learned and
directions for where to go next.
The recommended decision says
that in a competitive market, utilities
should play no role in providing electric
or gas service. But before the PSC
removes a utility from the market, cer-tain
preconditions must be met, ""includ-ing
a determination that the wholesale
and retail markets are operating without
the exercise of market power. As a gen-eral
matter, the utilities should not be
removed from any market until multiple
suppliers offering a variety of products
are available for the entire customer
class throughout the utility's service ter-ritory.""
The PSC also should wait for state
lawmakers or the courts to confirm its
authority to take such action.
The recommended decision also
says that ""robust, fully competitive retail
markets will develop at different times
for different customer classes.""
The PSC should encourage invest-ment
in transmission and distribution
infrastructure for both electricity and gas
""including, if necessary, ordering the
franchised utilities to construct any need-ed
facilities,"" the recommended decision
says.
Although the PSC should restate its
support for retail competition and pro-ceed
""with deliberate speed in fostering
market development,"" the agency should
maintain ""just and reasonable rates""
throughout the period of transition to
competition.
""We are confident that a flexible
oversight process that encourages com-petition
and allows it to develop wherev-er
the economics can support it will pro-tect
consumers during the transition, per-mit
markets to develop freely, and will
serve the public interest,"" the recom-mended
decision says.
Exceptions to the proposed decision
are due tomorrow and responses are due
Aug. 28.
The judges and the PSC official plan
to present a final recommended decision
to the commission this fall. JCS

As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

"RE: Going physical or financial?","Luiz --

Yes there has been a shift in the thinking - away from the ""natural gas"" model and toward the financial structure.  Some of this is related to the political realities of the US market and FERC.  Some is that our traders in the East are comfortable with PJM and have been making term markets at PJM West hub.  All of this assumes that we should be able to migrate to a more physical model if the industry needs to later.

I do think that it would be helpful for you to get together and work up a discussion for all Government Affairs to explain the key differences and what policy discussions we need to focus upon - (i.e., setting up good ""hubs"" and auctioning transmission rights).

Also, I think that any thoughts you have on the implications for EES are important.  Not sure that either model is really ""great"" for competitive retailers.  The difficulty is that our predictions of load and the actual usage will always be different.  As long as (1) our analytics have the data to ""price"" basis between hubs and from a hub to a customer and (2) there is no discrimination in allocation of transmission rights then our ability to sell at retail will be competitive.

Subject:	Going physical or financial?

Jim

I have seen a  trend towards nodal pricing systems, financial contracts and financial mechanism to hegde ""base price"" risks among nodes.

I have also noted that this represents a growing majority within Enron (at least people I have been talking to recently)

In looking at my old files (perhaps 2 years ago), I have seen some internal statements advocating for physical rights, and physical mechanisms to deal with congestion. I have seen those statements in the context of California.

Two simple questions:

1) Is the financial world the one we should clearly advocate for?
2) Does the fact that financial hedges are ""imperfect"" bother any of our key trading groups/developers? 

If the trend is really going financial, I think there is a lot of work and education to be done in helping our folks (particularly EES) in drafting contracts which reflect this new reality. I had some experience in dealing with US lawyers examining PPA which were being prepared in Brazil (for example, between Elektro and Riogen). Those were purely financial.

Threre was a clear cultural shock between ""physical"" and ""financial mindsets"".  Folks had a great difficulty in understanding (therefore accepting) the sheer simplicity of a financial contract, when compared to a typical, full fledged PPA. Differences are many.  For example: Our Cuiab? I contract, which is physical, has a penalty provision for non-deliverability. This becomes unnecessary in the financial contract, as the spot price is the implicit penalty. Also, in a physical contract, the asset owner (not the buyer) have control on physical dispatch. In the financial contract, the buyer has no control whatsoever, and the asset owner is the one to submit bids.  Those are only examples. I've put together several presentations explaining the basic differences.

 If ""financial"" contracts prevail, I think we should spend a good amount of time in explaining/training our folks in this new world. My feeling is that this change will be easier for the trading desk, but more difficult for EES and for asset developers (long term PPAs)

Any thoughts?

Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets

Wow!  What a year 2001 has been for the supporters of energy competition.
For every good bit of news (Pat Wood, one of our heroes at CAEM, being
selected to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the
continuing progress that the Canadians - yes, the Canadians - have made
towards energy competition), we have had to bear one disaster and misstep
after another throughout the year.   Let's see, in December 2000, who
couldhave predicted..

1.  The tragic events of September 11th.
2.  The California implosion.
3.  Pennsylvania marketer retrenchment.
4.  Price volatility and high prices (but it could have been worse if Mother
Nature did not help out).
5.  Bush Energy Plan ignores meaningful restructuring.
6.  Enron collapse.
7.  FERC Blinks on Super RTO.
8.  Texas missteps in pilots for opening the market.
9.  No leadership emerged to meet the crisis in restructuring.

2001 was one heck of a year - but thankfully, probably the nadir of the
movement towards energy competition in North America.  As CAEM looks into
our crystal ball (natural gas fired, of course) for the coming year, we see
a better year.  Below are some of the predictions and responses from the
CAEM staff about what we expect to occur.  The responses below are primarily
concerned with electricity, but to a lesser extent, may be applied to
natural gas as well.

As always, do not bet the house on what we have to say.  We are just a
little think tank, kind of like the little engine that could.  And we can.
And we do.

Happy New Year!

The CAEM Staff

P.S. If you would like to add a prediction or two, please send an e-mail
with your name and contact information to Hope Duncan at hduncan@caem.org We
will post them to our web site - www.caem.org  Please identify which
question below is being addressed by your prediction.

Subject:	Latest Info on CPUC Suspending Direct Access

Latest information on CPUC Decision --

Commissioner Bilas filed an Alternative Draft for the CPUC that would:

*	hold DA suspension and have the CPUC conduct hearings that would work out details including impact on bonds and phasing ending of DA,
*	resolved issues related to credits and payments of Negative CTC, and
*	hold hearings dealing with bottoms-up ratemaking for DA.

This is effectively an updated version of the alternate that Bilas put out last time the CPUC considered this issue.  It is a long-shot that this alternative would be approved.  

Our current information is still that the CPUC will vote to suspend DA as of Sept 1.

[Lavorato, John]  I bet you 100 bucks they delay the decision.

We should intervene based on our potential interest in serving customers pursuant to AB661(short answer=Paul's language).  It is possible that we may want to reduce revenue requirements by recommending the use of financial products to minimize utility revenue risk. We have intervened in the AB 661 regulation proceeding as Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. If you think we can raise issues outside of ""unbundling"" we should limit our intervention to EES and EPMI.

We have intervened in certain cases where we may have an ongoing
commercial interest to require ""rate unbundling"" in anticipation of
direct access.  We also can intervene on behalf of EWS who may provide
risk mgt. products to reduce utility rates (i.e., weather derivitives to
stabilize rates and reduce utility-reated risk).  In this case we are
there to make sure rates are properly unbundled to facilitate AB 661.

By this e-mail, I'm forwarding this to Pat Keene.  He will be your main
contact on Nevada matters for a while.  I'm swamped processing the
filings for the sale of PGE.  My view is that it should be both ENA and
EES.  Our interest is:  (1) we are a potential new electric resource
under AB 661; and (2) these cases will influence whether we can serve
customers under the statute as the unbundled costs incurred by our
potential customers will be determined in this case.

Pat:  What do we say in other states where we intervene and there is no
direct access?  I'd rather not say that we that we are representing the
interests of several large consumers in Nevada.  It opens our deals up
for discovery.

information has changed.  Do you want the petition to reflect both ENRON
ENERGY SERVICES, INC. and ENRON NORTH AMERICA.  Also, since you do not
own LV Cogen anymore, what would you like me to put as the reasons for
intervention for these entities.  I have attached a draft petition.  It

Christie, below is the message I sent to Tom. Attached are the objections. I'll call you Tuesday morning to see where things stand on this.
____________________________________

Tom, the PaPUC has recently assessed gas marketers for the regulatory expenses for the PUC, the OCA and the OSBA. Enron Energy Services' assessment for all three is $147,277.

Unless you tell us to the contrary, we assume that you want us to file objections to the assessments. Attached are objections that we have prepared. Can you please fax us a copy of the assessment notice Enron received? We believe the assesments may have been received around 8/19-8/21.

Objections must be filed within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the assessment notice.  The 15-day objection period begins on the date the certified mail return receipt is signed.  If the 15th day falls on a weekend or a legal holiday, the last date for filing is extended to the next business day.

The statutes require the assessments to be paid within 30 days of receipt, even though objections are filed.  The payments must be made ""under protest"" in order to be refunded under the statutory procedure, which we believe is inadequate.

We are attempting to avoid the payment obligation thru a preliminary injunction request in Commonwealth Court, but we have no assurance that the court will act before the 30th day for payment.  If not, the assessment must be paid under protest.  If necessary, we will provide a cover letter for the protest payment to the PUC.

Please call me if you have any questions or comments. Thanks.

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

FYI - RE: your statement this morning about Boeing, Raytheon indicated this morning, that on last Friday's conference call with California Manufacturers & Tech. Assn., Boeing told the lobbing group at CMTA they had to prevail with an 8/31/01 retro date and it was apparent that APS ES was their supplier....CLECA probably has the same marching orders from Boeing if they are still members there...

Importance:	High

Jim, please see me about this issue.  As you can see, Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our 200,000 MMBtu/day of Block 2 capacity on El Paso.  In fact, I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March, even before we signed up for the capacity.  You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list.  I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far.

The CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies.  Their concern is not the same as PG&E's.  And to the extent anything is agreed to, reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms, and I don't think we want to go there.  We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PG&E and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived.

Steph - Leslie and I were just talking about this, and one thing we need to keep in mind is that any attempt to modify the PG&E recall rights would almost certainly be opposed by the CPUC, especially if it was to benefit Enron.

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says ""and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.""  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the ""traditional rate making"" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out.

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

Stephanie

Subject:	Re: SW Gas

We have yet to receive a final order.  I would prefer to have it in hand before a complaint is filed.  There is another year to go on the statute of limitations, and thus aside from the natural desire to get money sooner rather than later (and especially while Commissioner Spitzer is still on the Commission, which should be through the end of 2002), there is no particular rush.  Also, your ""coalition"" partner in the war on SWG imbalance terrorism, Midwest United, has also authorized a complaint, so there is the possibility to again share the costs of any such proceeding.

I didn't expect the merchant generators to be thrilled with the APS filing, but then I'm sure they wouldn't like a complete repeal of the electric oompetition rules, which at least one Commissioner seems to favor, or an order preventing any divestiture of APS generation and any competitive bidding, which is another distinct possibility from a Commission that has effectively lost its faith in competition.  Hopefully the Texas people at least read the application this time.  I can also tell you that APS is quietly upset that the merchant generators say nothing when SRP does far worse things, or when Citizens gets a total waiver of the same regulation for which APS seeks a partial waiver, or when TEP files their plan (which will happen shortly) making APS' look like a wild pro-market experiment.  In other words, APS takes a lot of grief not because it is perceived as the most anti-competitive incumbent (even our worst enemy would privately agree we are probably the best in this state), but simply because it is the most visable.

>>> ""Lawner, Leslie"" <Leslie.Lawner@ENRON.com> 10/31/01 08:29AM >>>
Has the ACC issued an actual order onthe SW Gas?  I  have not seen
anything.  I have to formal go ahead on filing the complaint for the
refund, so let me know what your strategy is for that.  I assume we
should run the numbers with some accuracy, and I can have the number
crunchers here do that.

Your APS filing is not being too well received in the hinterlands
(Texas) from what I hear.  Expect some noise.

Hope you are enjoying the World's Series.

Jeane, I have evidence on some DA bills where SCE has assessed late fees on
disputed bills.  I haven't been able to do a thorough analysis, but knowing
the amount we have disputed so far, the charges could be substantial.

I understood that, until the CPUC makes a decision, the UDC can not charge
late fees on disputed bills.  Correct?

Subject:	Letter to PUC Regarding Texas Taxes on T&D Services

Jean/Jim:

Jeff Fischer and I in EES Tax have been working with Nancy Hetrick regarding the question of whether REPs will be responsible for administering Texas taxes on T&D services.

As you may have heard, at the request of a number of investor owned utilities, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts has initially ruled that REPs will be responsible for administering the taxes.  This conclusion was based upon the assumption that the REPs are purchasing the T&D Services from the TDU and then reselling the services to their customers.

After a number of REPs objected to that ruling, the Comptroller's office agreed to reconsider.  We believe the Comptroller is worried about doing something that will have a serious impact on deregulation in Texas, so she is passing the question off to the Texas PUC by requesting that the PUC determine whether REPs purchase and resell T&D Services.

The New Power Company raised this issue with the PUC recently and at last count TXU and Entergy had filed responses of their own.  A number of tax representatives from several REPs thought it might be good to show the PUC this is a significant issue for all independent REPs.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a proposed letter to the PUC regarding this matter.  Nancy suggested we send the letter to you for your comments and to get clearance for EESI to sign the letter.  Thank you for your assistance with this.

Subject: RTO cost benefit analysis



Per Jim, Enron is going to participate in EPSA's cost benefit analysis for the SE RTO.  Mirant and possibly others have said that they will perform a cost benefit analysis for the Midwest.  We are not going to participate in those.  (Please keep in mind that Enron did the ""natural markets studies"" for the SE and the NE).  Thanks.

Kerry -- 
I think this looks fine.  Please ask Mike and see if Donna thinks this is fine (Donna -- What effect would this groups asking for the 12/15 start date to be pushed back have on AEP's merger?)

Kevin is ok with Enron signing on to this, even if the start date is pushed back some.


FYI to all -- Please remember to include Donna and Sarah on issues dealing with FERC.  Thanks.

We have an opportunity to join in sponsoring the attached pleading by Virginia Commission et al.  The pleading protests Alliances' interim independent board proposal included in its 8/27 compliance filing as non-compliant with FERC's 7/12 Alliance Order and with Order 2000, asserts that its 8/27 compliance filing should be rejected in-part (the exception being that portion of the filing addressing permanent governance) since it was not reviewed by a permanent independent board, and requests suspension of any further decision-making by the Alliance members.  We should definitely consider joining in this protest, but need to act today.

Subject:	Motion to reject, protest and request for immediate stay....

 <<82701protest.doc>> Attached for your review and consideration is a draft
""Motion to Reject, Protest, and Further Start-up Activities by the Alliance
Companies of The Virginia State Corporation Commission"". 
We have opted not to file a complaint and have choosen the abovce approach.
While a motion for stay is traditionally only filed when a party seeks to
stay an agency order, in this instance we thought it would be appropriate to
request that the Commission ""stay"" the Alliance Companies' RTO-related
start-up activities, pending implementation of an independent board.  Given
the new chair's interest in competitive markets, we think there is nothing
to lose with this approach, and we believe making the arguments in the
context of the requirements for a stay may emphasize the critical nature of
the request.
I have been informed that 8 of the 10 Alliance Companies have signed a
letter of intent to enter into negotiations for National Grid to become the
managing member. The interim governance proposal is ""pretty close"" to the
Tuesday's Alliance Company proposal.
The draft anticipates that the Alliance Companies will put forth a interim
governance similar to what they put forward last Tuesday.  We will, of
course, have to make adjustments after we have actually seen the filing.
We look forward to receiving your input.

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC order
states:

     ""The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited"" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            ""PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001.""
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject to
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following
information must be included for each customer on this list for your DASR
to be eligible for future processing:

Please include the following information for each customer on this list:

     ?    Customer Name
     ?    Service Account Number
     ?    Service Address
     ?    Contract Date

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or verified
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit the
respective ""connect"" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All ""connect""
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any ""connect"" DASRs

Subject:	Conference Call Today with FERC Staff

A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main Enron number) - a CPUC staffer named Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

Someone named Dan at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to Enron.  It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that ""the facility isn't anywhere near the campus.""

The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.  His phone number is 503-752-0873.  

I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.

The CPUC staffer is Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask Dan.  What should we do??

Can we sit down and discuss our strategies going forward in light of this RD?  I'd like to understand where there are opportunities (both for POLR outsourcing and standard market entry).  I don't think that there will ever be a huge surplus in generation (and there shouldn't be in a competitive market).  Instead of focusing on something the NYPSC can't control, why not work on demand responsiveness?  Better metering technology would certainly help.

Subject:	Highlights of the Recommended Decision in NY's Energy Competition Case

Sarah,
I've attached an article from today's Megawatt Daily regarding NY's generic energy competition case.  I've also attached a summary of the RD written by Kevin Brocks, our NESPA Counsel.  As you can see, the RD dismisses aggressive migration measures until wholesale markets are functioning better.  Furthermore, the RD states that until supplies increase and markets stabilize, ratepayers must be protected.  In addition, a PSC official is quoted as saying that it ""will be another three to four years until there is sufficient supply in the state to allow for workably competitive markets, and that it could be at least 10 years before retail competition is viable.""  

Is there anything in the RTO Order or your participation thus far in the mediation process that could refute the claim that it will be 3 or 4 years until there is sufficient supply in NY to allow for workably competitive markets?
-Kathleen

MegawattDaily
New York PSC draft report sees competition in 3-4 years

New York regulatory staff expects
comments tomorrow on a recom-mended
decision about the future of
competitive power market development
in the state.
The recommended decision, issued
last month by two administrative law
judges for the state Public Service Com-mission
and a PSC official (00-M-0504),
says it will be another three to
four years until there is sufficient supply
in the state to allow for workably com-petitive
markets, and that it could be at
least 10 years before retail competition
is viable.
Two principal problems in transi-tioning
to a competitive market are
inelastic supply and demand, both of
which are inherent in energy markets, the
proposed decision, issued last month,
says. Until supply consistently exceeds
demand by a certain margin, the PSC
must play a prominent role in the state's
power markets.
""Markets characterized by largely
inelastic supply and demand where
demand is approaching or is equal to
supply are not workably competitive and
will not produce just and reasonable
rates,"" the recommended decision says.
""Until supplies increase, ratepayers
should be provided some measure of
protection from those markets. Once
supply exceeds demand sufficiently to
eliminate the exercise of excessive mar-ket
power, the markets can become
workably competitive and will likely
produce just and reasonable rates.""
The recommended decision goes on
to warn, ""Unrealistic expectations con-cerning
the timing of market develop-ment
(either too long or too short) can
have serious consequences to the public,
and can, in the extreme, result in the
worst of all possible outcomes - the
creation of an unregulated monopoly.
""If competition is assumed to
develop very rapidly and wholesale
market prices are imposed on customers
without regulatory intervention and
from a market that is not workably com-petitive,
higher prices and rates that do
not meet the statutory standard of just
and reasonable are likely. On the other
hand, if a long transition is assumed and
significant regulatory control continues
to be exercised over prices, competition
and its benefits could be stifled indefi-nitely.""
In March 2000, the PSC initiated
the proceeding to examine the state's
progress toward competitive markets. It
sought information on the difficulties
that have emerged, lessons learned and
directions for where to go next.
The recommended decision says
that in a competitive market, utilities
should play no role in providing electric
or gas service. But before the PSC
removes a utility from the market, cer-tain
preconditions must be met, ""includ-ing
a determination that the wholesale
and retail markets are operating without
the exercise of market power. As a gen-eral
matter, the utilities should not be
removed from any market until multiple
suppliers offering a variety of products
are available for the entire customer
class throughout the utility's service ter-ritory.""
The PSC also should wait for state
lawmakers or the courts to confirm its
authority to take such action.
The recommended decision also
says that ""robust, fully competitive retail
markets will develop at different times
for different customer classes.""
The PSC should encourage invest-ment
in transmission and distribution
infrastructure for both electricity and gas
""including, if necessary, ordering the
franchised utilities to construct any need-ed
facilities,"" the recommended decision
says.
Although the PSC should restate its
support for retail competition and pro-ceed
""with deliberate speed in fostering
market development,"" the agency should
maintain ""just and reasonable rates""
throughout the period of transition to
competition.
""We are confident that a flexible
oversight process that encourages com-petition
and allows it to develop wherev-er
the economics can support it will pro-tect
consumers during the transition, per-mit
markets to develop freely, and will
serve the public interest,"" the recom-mended
decision says.
Exceptions to the proposed decision
are due tomorrow and responses are due
Aug. 28.
The judges and the PSC official plan
to present a final recommended decision
to the commission this fall. JCS

Subject:	GPU Energy

GPU Energy has requested that EES provide an updated Third Party Supplier agreement as approved by the NJ Board of Public Utilities.
EES currently has financial customers behind GPU. Physical delivery is not projected to commence until 2003. I and Will 
Frederking have reviewed the TPS Agreement and identified some issues that will require the attention and sign-off of the
business units. Relevant business issues include:
1. Credit worthiness standards - EES to provide security equal to 60 days of customer summer usage
2. Taxes - EES to collect and remit all taxes related to electricity sales 
3. Limitation of Liability - EES must insure that any T & D failure including disconnections, curtailment, interruption or reduction of service, is a force majeure event in our contracts, 
4. Billing  - EES is precluded from raising billing disputes, 20 days after the invoice due date 
5. Assignment - GPU consent is required before any assignment by EES
The attached memo sets out these and other issues in more detail. Please note that EES has a similar agreement with Public Service Electric
& Gas Company of New Jersey. Because these agreements are filed with the BPU, and apply to all NJ utilities, GPU resists any attempt 
to propose amendments. Please review and advise by noon tomorrow if you'll approve executing the document as is.

Subject:	2002 PJM Annual Fee

PJM sent a bill for the 2002 Annual Fee (for $5000).

Upon paying the fee, EPMI will be able to access E-Schedules.  

PJM is looking for payment on December 20, 2001 along with our November grid payment.

I assume that no Enron company will need the E-Schedule system after January 1 and therefore we will not be making this payment?

Please advise.

This is a direct result of the recent actions from GISB to get involved in the wholesale electric standards.   We and EPSA have made positive statements about the GISB process.  NERC has been forced to change to accomodate what many in the industry are looking for.  There are still many ""ifs"" at GISB at this time, much of it around how much the big utilitites would be willing to support it.  Our position has been - whoever provided the best deal first, that is where the industry will take its business.

Kevin's preferences for RTO standards is not out of the question.   FERC will utlimately decide how much standards setting authority the RTOs will have.   NERC will certainly foucs - at least - on inter-RTO standards, something RTOs will not do well, if at all.  Howvever, NERC must not impede on internal RTO market structures and rules - a ""commercial standard""  - this is why NERC recognizing commercial interests is such a big step.

Jim,
 
This isn't the most appropriate time to be asking for this favor but I was wondering if you would write a letter of recommendation for me for business school.  I've already been accepted to DU's law program but I've recently decided to pursue their joint JD/MBA degree.  So....I need to apply to their business school separately.  
 
Rick wrote a letter for me when I applied to the law school, and I thought you would be a good person to write one for the MBA.
 
I am attaching a form that you can detach and fill out (you can include comments within this form or draft a letter of recommendation and include as an attachment).  When you're finished, I will give you a special envelope that you have to sign and seal.  Return the envelope to me, and I will mail it with the application and other materials directly to the school.
 
Just so you know, I've also asked one of the emission brokers at Cantor Fitzgerald to write a letter and also Greg Woulfe (who I reported to on the Power Desk).   
 
I'm applying to the Univerisity of Denver Daniels College of Business
www.dcb.du.edu <http://www.dcb.du.edu> (if you want more information).
 
I hope you don't mind.  I just need to have it all completed by December 1st.

FYI.  The PUC's rule under which Enron Energy Sservices was certified as an
REP in Texas requires that a REP notify the Commission of any petition in
bankruptcy within 10 days of the filing.  In addition, 10-day notification
is required for any material change in the financial requirements presented
by a REP pursuant to which its application for REP certification was
approved.  A REP has 30 days to notify the Commission of any change in the
technical conditions presented in its application.  Finally, a REP may not
cease operations as a REP without prior notice to the Commission, as well as
to customers and any other affected persons (such as the T&D utility, etc.).

Please let me know if we can assist Enron in any of these filings, and give
me a call if you have any questions.  The relevant rule governing these
requirements is PUC Substantive Rule 25.107.

Subject:	PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Subject:	Storage Monetization

I spoke with Mary Kay Miller when she was in town to give her an update of where we were on the storage project.  I told her we had gotten the LeBoeuf law firm and Brown, Williams involved to help.  I told her that both firms suggested that once pipelines were sufficiently interested in the storage monetization products, they should set up meetings at FERC and with their own respective pipeline customers in order to explain specific storage monetization proposals.

She was glad for the update and was comfortable with the suggested meetings as long as Enron did not attend the meetings at FERC or with the pipeline's customers.  This seems what LeBouef and Brown, Williams had in mind, since the pipelines are responsible for the regulatory needs of the storage project.  Enron is merely offering background research in order to get the pipelines interested in the storage monetization and to give the pipelines ideas on how to put the project in the best regulatory framework at FERC.

I would like to send this note to Paul Bieniawski if you agree with my comments.

Jim-- I talked with Sarah Novosel on Friday and she thought that Donna/she were the best point people to have an initial conversation with Audrey.  We had apparently intervened at FERC on the Detroit Edison transco proposal a few weeks ago and that intervention is what sparked Audrey's thoughts on trying to get us as an ally rather than enemy.  I will be sure that Donna shares her thoughts with the midwest group (we have weekly calls and one is scheduled I believe for Wenesday of this week).

Subject:	Xcel


Donna/Sarah--I got together with Audrey Zibelman from Xcel on Friday afternoon to catch up and she wanted to talk about the petition that Xcel and the other midwest utilities had filed on transferring their assets into a for profit transco, Translink.  In my discussions with Audrey, she expressed a hope that Enron would be able to support the filing and that she'd like to open a dialogue on how to get our support.  I indicated that there were at least 2 issues that would be of concern for us---support for one RTO and support for one tariff within that RTO.  Although she was open and probably even supportive of one RTO in the midwest, there is a separate tariff for any delivery within the Translink system within her proposal.  SHe described that tariff as being different than the Detroit Edison case that you guys filed against.  I confirmed that the publics who are in the transco (NPPD, OPPD, Cornbelt) would not agree to be in the transco without the separate tariff.

I have sent via overnight a copy of materials on the transco to both of you.  I told her that Donna was that lead on the Midwest team, and that you'd be willing to talk/meet with her.  If practical, it would be good if you could call her in the next few days for a number of reasons---1.) I am sure that Xcel is planning a similiar transco for the west and if you can get a better sense of whether we are on any of the same pages, it would be good to have that input for our western discussion on Wednesday in Houston  2.) she is one of the panelists for RTO week, so you might be able to set up a time in D.C. that you could meet in person  3.) you might be able to get a sense of what she will be talking about at RTO week on her panel.

My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like ""CYA not Calif Youth Admin"" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.

I want to thank you for taking some time to speak with me this morning about my current position relative to Enron's market position.  More importantly, I want to thank you for your candor and honesty.  I walked away from the meeting feeling elated and confident, regardless of the bleak message.   

I only wish you the best of luck these next few weeks.  You are in a tough position, a position I do not envy.  I am heeding your advice and looking for opportunities outside this organization.  I had hoped to work in your group as an associate rotation.  I am certain that I could have learned a great deal from you and parlayed it into opportunities for this organization.  Maybe our paths will cross in the future. 

If there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to contact me.  My cell phone number is 713.444.8282 and work extension is 51793.  

Yours Sincerely,

Member Alert #38-2001
August 15, 2001

NYISO Argues for RTO Filing Reversal

The New York Independent System Operator wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to rethink its July 12 order creating a northeastern Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) that would include New England, New York, and the PJM region.
    In a filing made earlier this week the NYISO argued that the commission order ""ignored important reliability, technical and engineering considerations.""

    ""Failing to consider these factors could result in serious harm to New York,"" the NYISO filing says. ""The NYISO is therefore submitting this rehearing request in order to ensure that the RTO formation effort does not lose sight of the needs of New York's economy, or the well-being of its citizens.""

    The NYISO filing also asserts that the commission made ""substantial errors""  regarding ""several key legal issues.""

The NYISO asked the commission to:
? Reverse its decision on the scope and configuration of an RTO.
? Reverse its determination that the entire northeast is a natural market.
? Reverse the mandate that there be a single Northeast RTO.
? Reverse its conclusion that the NYISO isn't independent enough from market participants.
? Reverse its finding that the NYISO's operational authority, tariff filing rights, congestion management, parallel path                            flow procedures, and inter-regional coordination efforts fall short of RTO standards.

The NYISO was joined in its Aug. 14 filing by Central Hudson Gas and Electric, Consolidated Edison, Nigara Mohawk Power Corporation, New York State Electric and Gas, Orange and Rockland Utilities, and Rochester Gas and Electric.

The FERC should clarify that even if the NYISO proposal was deficient in the issue of parallel path flow management and transmission planning that it could still qualify as an RTO because those issues will be resolved by 2004, the NYISO argues.

    The NYISO asked the FERC to either declare it an RTO or permit it to make a compliance filing to fix any deficiencies that would prevent it from reaching RTO status. And finally, the NYISO argues that if FERC continues to insist that there be a single RTO in the northeast, that it should initiate a rulemaking process "" so that it may more thoroughly evaluate the technical details, costs, benefits, and implications of various RTO formation operations.""

    Currently FERC is conducting a series of hearings on the proposed RTO to outline the issues that have to be addressed.
    
    FERC's July 12 order is ""overly simplistic"" and ignores policy mistakes in California that "" confirm the need for a more thoughtful approach to RTO issues,"" the NYISO filing says.
    The RTO FERC wants to impose on the northeast would be ""electrically and geographically enormous"" and include ""a number of severe transmission constraints and dense, electrically complex sub-regions"" the filing says.

 "" A system of this size and complexity has never been attempted before. It is not known whether such a system could be efficiently operated or whether existing ISO software systems would be capable of managing it,"" the NYISO filing says.

FERC ordered the creation of this super-RTO ""without any analysis of the challenges, costs, benefits, and other implications of the single RTO/single market model,"" the NYISO filing says. ""It has declined to evaluate seriously available RTO policy alternatives that could be more efficient.""

The NYISO filing also criticizes FERC for insisting that PJM market rules and software be used in this proposed Northeast RTO without assessing how well they will work when applied to New York or the entire Northeast.

""This is an unduly precipitous approach that should be reconsidered on rehearing,"" the NYISO filing says.

    The three existing ISOs have already committed to implementing standardized market rules and common transaction-scheduling procedures and other ""seams"" solutions that would result in all the benefits the RTO is supposed to bring, the NYISO filing says . Dumping these efforts will retard RTO development instead of accelerate it, the NYISO argues.

    The FERC order ignores some of the existing physical constraints in the transmission systems that prevent more power flowing between ISOs, the NYISO filing says. Creation of an RTO will not increase inter-ISO trade and there will continue to be three distinct markets in the northeast, the filing says.

    The NYISO filing also argues that the PJM market the FERC is advocating as the model for the northeast could just as easily be considered a part of the Midwest region.  While PJM can export 2250 megawatts to New York it can export 6500 megawatts to West Virginia and Ohio and 2500 megawatts to Virginia, the filing points out.

    In general, while the commission has asserted that there are four natural electricity markets in the United States, it hasn't spelled out the boundaries, the filing says.

    ""This is emblematic of the lack of analytical rigor that characterizes the commission's approach to market definition,"" the filing says. This approach allows Allegheny Energy and SPP utilities, for example, to choose between two RTOs, while northeastern utilities are not offered a choice, the filing says.

    The NYISO also argued against FERC conclusions that the New York operator could qualify as an RTO because it lacked sufficient size, could not achieve effective scope, and wasn't independent enough from its market participants. "" These holdings are unlawful, arbitrary and capricious,"" the filing says.

    FERC is making an unexplained and sudden departure from the principles it establishing in Order No. 2000 that spelled out what an RTO should be, the filing says.  FERC also denied the NYISO and member systems a chance to modify the NYISO RTO proposal to address the concerns the commission raised, the filing say.

    For more information or to obtain a copy of the NYISO filing contact the IPPNY office at 518-436-3749.

Bob,

Per Section 25.345 (c) of the Electric rules, if the Cogen facility has a rated capacity of 10MW or less, it qualifies as ""eligible generation"" under Section 25.345(c)(B). In Section 25.345(i), an end-user whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation and who does not receive any electrical service that requires the delivery of power through the facilities of a T & D utility is not responsible for payment of any stranded cost charges.  

Also a retail customer whose actual load is lawfully served by eligible generation who also receives electrical service that require the delivery of power through the facilities of a T & D utility, shall be responsible for payment of stranded costs charges based solely on the services that are actually provided by the T & D utility.

The short answers to your questions are:
1. Rock Tenn will not be required to pay CTC charges if its rated output is less than 10MW, and it does not take any T&D services from TXU.
2. If Rock Tenn uses T&D facilities occasionally, it will pay CTC only for the actual services it receives from the T& D utility. 
3. If Rock Tenn completely disconnects from the utilities T&D services, it will be in the same position as in 1 above. It will not be required to pay the CTC.
4. At this time, TXU does not have a financing bond issued by the Commission. In an earlier order, the Commission approved $363 MM for TXU, but that order was appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for rehearing. With information that is available to it at this time, the Commission does not think that TXU has stranded costs. I believe TXU will disagree. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Gloria,

Per the information you provided Trish (below) concerning CTC in TX, the cogen design is less than 10MW. Therefore, what are the ""DG rules"" and how do these rules impact Rock Tenn's requirement to pay CTC? What if they only use the utility's T&D facilities occasionally when the cogen is not running? What if they completely disconnect from the utility's T&D facilities, as if they are no longer in business? Is TXU expected to have significant stranded costs?

Thanks, Bob

Trish,

Per Chapter 39.252(b)(1) of the Texas Utilities Code, recovery of stranded costs by an electric utility shall be from all existing or future retail customers within the utility's certificated territory as it existed on May 1, 1999. A retail customer may not avoid CTC's by switching to a new on-site generation. New on-site generation is defined as an electric generator generating more than 10 MW, capable of being lawfully delivered to the site without use of the utility T & D facilities, and which was not fully operational prior to 12/31/99. (If the self-gen facility's output is 10 MW or less, it will be governed by the DG  rules.)

If a customer commences taking energy from a new on-site generation (with output of more than10 MW ) which materially reduces or eliminates the customer's use of energy delivered through the utility's facilities, the customer shall pay an amount each month computed by multiplying the output of the on-site generation by the CTC which is in effect during the month.

Any CTC assessed on such a self -gen facility after it becomes fully operational, shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with services actually provided by the T & D utility to the customer after the facility has become fully operational. So if no services actually provided, there should be no payment.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Harry Kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit ConEd to discuss the Benchmark Rate Swap.  I think it's a great idea (Scott Gahn and I had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran URM).  

My only thoughts for you would be: 1) maybe difficult to do the swap with the Utility (given PUC oversight), but the Holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from PUC scrutiny and 2) being long T&D (assuming that you don't sell 100% of the position to customers) creates interesting regulatory questions.

I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product.

"HOME DEPOT, ETC --- TEXAS CUSTOMERS GREATER THAN 1 MW","There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =

TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.

4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.

5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.

6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.

What I'd like to get out of this message is where Enron stands - what is your take on the hub and spoke, and what are your suggested alternatives?  I'd like to get a heads up of our members' perspectives on the matter prior to the meeting so as to structure the agenda in the most effective and helpful manner.

As you know, Commissioner Massey has been very vocal about re-evaluating the hub and spoke, and we now have Commissioner Brownell voicing similar concerns.  Whether or not we see a NOPR in the future is anyone's call, but I'd like EPSA to be an industry leader if and when the opportunity arises.  Any help you can provide would be appreciated.

Sarah and I discussed this.  It seems that there is not much downside to remaining in the case with VEPCO ($4000).  We have known that a win at the DC Circuit means that FERC will reconsider, but now we have a new FERC.  A loss keeps us in the same position we are in now.  A win at the DC Circuit and, subsequently with FERC, would possibly mean some upside for Enron -- even if for one year pre-new RTOs (per Kevin $10-15 MM).  There is also something positive about being on the same side as a utility against another utility.
We should approach VEPCO about talking with some FERC people about possibly settlement:  it may lead to something positive and can allow us to discuss our RTO agenda and why RTOs (with our congestion management) solves this.  Thus, we think there is upside to continuing.  Let us know!  Thanks.

Subject: Enron v. FERC appeal at DC federal court (Entergy source and
sink)


The mediator in our appeal of the Entergy source and sink suggested that Enron may want to try and settle this.  I asked B&P for the costs to get through oral argument, which are only $4000.  During the course of our SE RTO mediation, the Entergy person working on congestion management agreed with me that implementation of the LMP/financial rights model in the SE would alleviate the need for the Entergy Attachment M and Southern's similar attachment.  However, that model (should we get it) won't be in effect until sometime next year (at the earliest).  Also, Enron has sold its control areas. (VEPCO, our co-appellant, still has Batesville in Entergy).

It seems that it would make sense for us to approach FERC staff working on this matter, get their thoughts, and then perhaps approach Entergy.  FERC is the one that would actually settle, not Entergy (also, FERC must change the policy -- getting Entergy to simply withdraw Att. M is certainly good for precedent, but Southern can still keep its Att. unless FERC makes Southern change its tariff).  If nothing else, having another FERC avenue to voice our support for the LMP financial rights model (no day ahead balanced schedules), which alleviates this discriminatory practice like Entergy Att. M, would be helpful.  What are your thoughts?

This is just a rumor we're hearing, but we heard that FERC wants someone who knows ERCOT congestion management on the congestion management panel for RTO Week  because FERC (presumably Pat Wood) wants to use the ERCOT congestion management system as the standard CMS throughout the country.  From what I know about ERCOT (which isn't much and I have a call in to Thane to get an update), this wouldn't be a good thing for us.  We'll keep you posted.

I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC ""overpayment"".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC ""overpayment""?  

On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the ""overpayment"" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.

After 3/31/02, the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit, no?  So a customer's CTC payments should not be affected by refunds. 

If refunds are distributed prospectively, we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PG&E's expected refunds, divide it by total load, and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount.  This is more akin to a lower shopping credit than a higher CTC.

Alan --

The only way to collect the ""overpayment"" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.

I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.  If PG&E reduces going-forward procurement costs to reflect FERC-ordered refunds, I do not understand why it would affect already-issued CTC charges.  The cost of power would be cheaper going forward.

Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable ""HC"" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or  ""Est RT$""  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

We could not do that.  On the other hand, if we advocate that it should only apply to those who directly benefitted, and the CPUC adopts that reasoning, we would be shooting our tax argument in the foot.  I think you are right that we need to understand the implications, both financially and contractually, of the options before the Commission.

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.

Subject:	$.01 surcharge as ""tax""

A typical clause reads as follows:

"" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include ""any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges""], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates.""

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes ""applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point"" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes ""applicable prior to the Delivery Point.""  The surcharge would seem to be applicable ""at the Delivery Point.""

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a ""tax"" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a ""rate increase""

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a ""tax"" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the ""frozen tariff"" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a ""rate increase""

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of ""taxes"" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

"FW: Letter to PUC Regarding Texas Taxes on T&D Services","
Harry & Nancy --

I am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way REPs work with the T&D company.  In Enron's advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the ""customer of record"" - better limits the Utility control over the market.  Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.  I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.   Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.  This is a cost of our business.  

Let's talk.

Subject:	Letter to PUC Regarding Texas Taxes on T&D Services

Jean/Jim:

Jeff Fischer and I in EES Tax have been working with Nancy Hetrick regarding the question of whether REPs will be responsible for administering Texas taxes on T&D services.

As you may have heard, at the request of a number of investor owned utilities, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts has initially ruled that REPs will be responsible for administering the taxes.  This conclusion was based upon the assumption that the REPs are purchasing the T&D Services from the TDU and then reselling the services to their customers.

After a number of REPs objected to that ruling, the Comptroller's office agreed to reconsider.  We believe the Comptroller is worried about doing something that will have a serious impact on deregulation in Texas, so she is passing the question off to the Texas PUC by requesting that the PUC determine whether REPs purchase and resell T&D Services.

The New Power Company raised this issue with the PUC recently and at last count TXU and Entergy had filed responses of their own.  A number of tax representatives from several REPs thought it might be good to show the PUC this is a significant issue for all independent REPs.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a proposed letter to the PUC regarding this matter.  Nancy suggested we send the letter to you for your comments and to get clearance for EESI to sign the letter.  Thank you for your assistance with this.

Ron

"Issues in IL","1.	Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERC

Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year.

2.	MISO vs. ARTO

IP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year in Illinois.

3.	CTC Bet in ComEd

My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.

4.	Delivery Service Tariff Litigation

ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.

5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination

ComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to ""deliver"" today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?

6.	Relative Size of Current EES Book

ComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)
IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)

Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.

  _____  

""8. Mitigation Beyond Summer 2001
Although we are confident of the efficacy of our West-wide mitigation plan throughout the Summer of 2001, we nonetheless wish to obtain comment for the purpose of revising the mitigation methodology for future periods, if necessary.  Accordingly, we invite interested partes to file with the Commission comments and proposals concerning: (1) any developments, either beneficial or adverse, which have occurred in the Western region spot markets as a result of this order; (2) any difficulties with implementation of the mitigation plan detailed in the order, and the relevant solutions thereto; and, most importantly (3) any alternative market mitigation approaches. In order to provide for timely review and analysis, we will require that parties' comments and proposals be submitted to the Commission within 60 days of the date of issuance of this order.""

  _____  

At tomorrow's WPTF Board meeting we will be discussing the filing of comments, which would be due next Monday, in response to this invitation.  This email is a heads-up that it would be helpful for Board members to begin sending comments and suggestions with regard to the three topics noted above.  Thanks!

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.

I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or (""god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

Subject:	RE: Enron's Security Review

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

I was told Bradford would, ""release the $1 million tomorrow.""  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		1,395						1,395
Peak Month MWh	8,993						5,694
Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Subject:	Physical Delivery in SPP

The Staff of the PUCT has filed a petition to determine whether the market institutions and participants are ready for competition in the Texas portion of SPP (SERC), namely Entergy Gulf States, SWEPCO,  and WTU power regions, copies attached.  Staff has also requested the PUCT to suspend the capacity auction for Entergy and SWEPCO but not for WTU.  The petition requests the PUCT to make the determination at the November 1, 2001, meeting and to suspend the capacity auction at the August 23, 2001, meeting.

In support of their petition, staff argues that there has been limited participation in the SERC region, based on an ""informal survey"" of the staff.  Staff also explains that the FERC has not yet approved a RTO for the SERC region (SPP).  Staff is concerned that if auction of capacity results in a low price, this will have a detrimental effect of the affiliated REPs headroom under the price to beat determination as it is all tied to the price of capacity at the auction.  In addition, staff is concerned if Entergy or SWEPCO sells 15% of their capacity and are required to serve 100% of their load.  The staff has not requested a delay in the WTU capacity auction due to the fact that the WTU capacity is located in ERCOT and WTU's relatively small load. 

In order to prepare for filing comments, if neccessary, Enron Government Affairs would like to know the following:
1)  Does EES/EWS have signed contracts for physical delivery in Entergy, SWEPCO or  WTU?
2)  What amount of load do we have contracted in each utility within SPP?
3)  It appears that SPP will not open and no RTO will be in place on 1/1/02.  Therefore, is EWS prepared to operate in SPP under the existing control area structure?

Please forward your responses to Thane Twiggs and myself.  Also, please feel free to contact either of us if you have any questions.  Thanks.

"RE: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid","I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our ""positive"" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their ""goofy"" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  

Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.

Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.

Jeff,

Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the ""netting"" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

I like it.  Our argument should be that the MISO is not an Indiana public utility.  I'd put it in the dialogue just to keep from having the process work out poorly.

Janine:

Below is a short response I have drafted if we choose to respond (although it is not clear to me that a response is necessary) to these emails.  I'm a little unclear about the positions of the people in the emails.  I think our best response to Ron (Cinergy) is that MISO does not serve load, so MISO is not accountable to IURC.  Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility?  If we agree with that statement, are they subject to any IURC oversight?  Even if they are, I don't think it should be because of the ""bundled"" retail load issue, but rather because IURC has the right to regulate all ""public utilities"" (perhaps for safety reasons?) within its state.  But if we agree that IURC does have some authority over MISO as an Indiana Public Utility, then we may need to revise the statement below.

I did not go into the issue of whether there will be any ""bundled retail load"" in Indiana once MISO is operating.  In a prior order, FERC says that all transmission must be under the MISO tariff.  If this is the case, one could argue that the service is no longer ""bundled"" but I don't think we want to get into that argument with these guys.  

Here is some language that I put together.  What does everyone else think?


The MISO is a FERC jurisdictional entity that will provide interstate transmission service throughout its region.  MISO will not serve retail load, nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers.  Therefore, we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC.  

Responsibility for serving retail customers will remain with the individual entities who are currently responsible for serving those customers.  They will contract for transmission service with the MISO and will have the obligation to serve their retail customers.  It will be these load serving entities who are accountable to the IURC, not MISO.

I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a ""public interest"" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and ""load up"" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific ""Christmas tree ornaments.""

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a ""rubber stamp"" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.

I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.

While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.  

I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.

For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.

This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.

Thanks - I appreciate your help,

Jim

From the financial community, I sent him the name of Leonard Hyman.  Andy Vesey (the person on Jim's Barton subcommittee panel) suggested Leonard as a possible speaker.  I also spoke with Margaret Morgan (Price Waterhouse and and an EPSA member) to see if she has any ideas, and she too suggested Leonard.  She says Leonard is very knowledgeable about California issues and would be a good speaker.  Margaret is checking with colleagues to see if they have any other recommendations.

Kevin:

It was good to meet you yesterday.  I decided to watch the Commission
meeting on television so I wasn't at FERC today, but I wanted to pass on
this information to you about possible panelists for the November 2
Infrastructure Meeting in Seattle.

From Governor Geringer's office, a staff level person is Steve Reynolds
(Wyoming Business Council, also staffs the Wyoming Energy Council).  

    His contact information:  (307) 777-2841.  sreyno@state.wy.us.
Steve is great, pro-RTO, pro-economic development.  

Lt. Governor Ohs (Montana) or Steve Snezak.  The Lt. Governor runs
Economic Development for the State.  

    Steve is the Lt. Gov.'s Chief Policy Aide.  406.444.3111.   

    Both Wyoming and Montana are pro-RTO.  

Other options:  Governor Leavitt is pro-infrastructure development, but
probably not a strong RTO supporter.  

        Jeff Burke (State of Utah Energy Office) is probably the
contact in Utah for this matter if you want a staff person.  

        His contact information is:  (801) 538-5428.
nroerp.jburks@state.ut.us

We are still looking for names to represent the financial industry.  I
will let you know what we find out.  Please let me know if you have
questions.

Below is what Jim put together to generally describe what would happen to our
customer's power prices if they went back to the utility.  Obviously the actual 
economic benefit or detriment of longer term contracts will not be known for
some time :

CA:	worse off
TX:	worse off, but will likely find a similar deal
IL:	worse off
NJ:	better off in the short term, worse off in the long term
OH:	worse off (First Energy)
MA:	some better / some worse
NY:	short term better / long term probably worse
ME:	worse off, but new rates come out in March that may make utility a better choice


Gas:	probably better off   

Lets discuss what we are doing state by state.  I know we can provide power in TX until 12/14
and in NY until 12/9, but I'm unclear on the status of the other states.

Mike Grigsby and Scott Neal both agree that they don't have any objection to intraday recall as long as it is an option that the releasing shipper can select as part of the initial release and they would know up front if a package they were bidding on was recallable mid-day - just another product which they would price accordingly.  Leslie thinks the optionality of it is contained in the order, but we'll file comments requesting clarification since it's not addressed head-on.

FERC is trying in the rule to give intraday recall rights to releasing shippers.   If this applies to all transactions, it obviously devalues and degrades capacity releases.  The proper approach is let the parties negotiate the arrangements they want and for the payment to reflect the level of firmness actually given.  In other words, if a releasing shipper wants the recall rights that FERC would give them as a matter of law in this rule, then they spell those rights out in their posting and negotiate the deal with that on the table.  If a shipper is willing to release capacity and forego any recall rights, they should be able to do this, and receive payment that reflects the nature of that service.  But having a rule that mandates recall that cannot be negotiated is uncalled for and contrary to the purposes of capacity release and open access.

Depending on the response to each offering, most will likely be made available.  For this effort, please rank up to five choices in the list below (1=highest).  We'll tally the results, identify which items will have priority and communicate back how those needs will direct implementation efforts.

As part of Public Affairs Global New Economy Initiative (GNEI), Margaret Allen has requested a comprehensive list of publications whose audiences are state and federal policymakers.  
 
For example, Roll Call, The Hill, National Review and Weekly Standard are a few of the magazines and newspapers whose readership includes the U.S. Congress.  
 
Part of the GNEI brand marketing initiative may include a certain level of advertising by Enron in these publications, and therefore it's important that we deliver to Margaret an adequate list to work from.  
 
Please identify someone on your team who will be responsible for pulling this list together and send me their names so that we can coordinate.
 
In addition to Washington, DC you should focus on those states where Enron has a significant stake in the wholesale and retail energy business as well as states where policies are being debated that affect Enron's other commodities (broadband etc).  
 
I will need the name of your designee by Friday, August 10th 
 
Margaret needs a final list by Friday, August 17th.

Two issues that we should work on -- First Energy discusses CBM (not sure of their position) and MAPSA deals with ICAP.  My recollection is that ICAP will not be addressed at this time?  Seems to me that we should  try and propose some resolution or at a minimum a separate proceeding to mediate this issue before 1/1/03?  What do you think?  On CBM, now is the time for FERC to get rid of this discriminatory practice.

"RE: Kevin Presto comments on the summary of Bingaman bill","Christi --

Let's talk.  

We are arguing against NERC, but Kevin needs to understand that something must be in its place. We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is Enron's approach.  Have you communicated that to Kevin?  

Also, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.  Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.

Subject:	Kevin Presto comments on the summary of Bingaman bill

John -- Kevin Presto, head of East Power Trading, had these comments:

Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards -- Kevin says, ""NERC should be eliminated.""

Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure: -- Kevin says that the ""uniform reporting to consumers, in monthly electric bills, of the known energy sources"" is not good because it supports day-ahead source requirements for retail suppliers.  Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose how to source their portfolio, whether from bilateral contracts done on an ahead basis or purchases in the spot market.  

John, the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill may alleviate this concern, but I don't know enough about how that works.  Several years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clean energy generator and it can trade those credits.  Therefore, the seller of clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean credits in order to claim it sold clean energy (meaning that the clean generator was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount of credits).  That program recognized that you can't specifically source a clean generator to a load because electricity doesn't flow that way.  Thus, portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported.  But I don't know how this bill's provisions would work.  You probably have the Enron experts on this (used to be Janel G.)  Thanks.

Tee times have been arranged on the East Course (18 holes of golf) at the Broadmoor for Thursday, November 8 (tee times: 1:40pm & 1:48pm).  The price for playing this course is actually $90; slightly cheaper than what is indicated below.  I have arranged for each of your golf charges to be charged to your individual rooms.  Please refer to the list below for additional charges such as, clubs & shoe charges.   I'm hoping to finalize all the activity choices by the end of the week, so please confirm by COB tomorrow Thursday, October 18 that your activity choice will remain golf.

Subject:	Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis - by the CBO

Jim,

Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by the CBO entitled, ""Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis"".  In reviewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ignore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were supposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate terms, such as ""Idle"" when describing plants that were unavailable because of maintenance or repair.

My reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on problems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in CA?  And if so, because of some of the mis-representations it contains, do we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some of the claims made in this paper?

Thanks,

Dave

Jim:

In Washington, we're primarily working on advocacy, which you're pretty familiar with.  Do you need more information -- we can summarize quickly if you'd like us to, but it's pretty much RTO mediation, RTO efforts in midwest, California and Pacific Northwest refunds.  Going forward, we have the Show Cause motion, possible affiliate NOPR, Supreme Court oral argument in October, other possible FERC proceedings such as interconnection policy, mandatory RTO participation, etc -- its just not defined yet.  Also, Tom Briggs continues to work with the Germany guys on an Eon strategy in the U.S.

Also, from the legislative side, you should ask John Shelk about what's expected this fall.

The only commercial deal we're involved in now (that I can think of) is Donna's Gas Storage Monetization proposal.  I'll ask her to send you more information on that.

With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.

I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.

While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.  

I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.

For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.

This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.

Thanks - I appreciate your help,

Jim

FYI, from West desk trader John Malowney that is working on wholesale and retail physical.  I am having a 3:00 conf call this afternoon with AW Turner and Joe.  As you may have seen, PGE's first proposal was rejected.  (I can tell you the problems there if you haven't seen the order.)  In any event, I would welcome your thoughts on John's message.  Thanks.

Not bad... it's difficult to identify what the Transmission Holders debits and or credits (cost exposure) would be as it does not reference a recognized indices such as the Mid-Columbia, it's settled after the fact, and the Transmission Holder is at the mercy of the LDC's incremental cost of their various generation units.

John -- This is what Duquense uses, which seems to be preferred when serving retail load.  What do you think about PGE using something like this?  Thanks.


SCHEDULE 4
	Energy Imbalance Service

Energy Imbalance Service is provided when a difference occurs between the scheduled and the actual delivery of energy to a load located within a Control Area over a single hour.  The Transmission Provider must offer this service when the transmission service is used to serve load within its Control Area.  The Transmission Customer must either purchase this service from the Transmission Provider or make alternative comparable arrangements to satisfy its Energy Imbalance Service obligation. 	

The charges for Energy Imbalance Service, for which there is no deadband or return of energy in kind, are as follows:

C	Schedules insufficient to meet load ?? For each hour in which the Transmission Customer schedules insufficient energy to meet its load in that hour, the Transmission Provider will charge the Transmission Customer the Incremen? tal Cost (as defined below) that the Transmis? sion Provider incurs to meet the load of the Transmission Customer in that hour.

C	Schedules in excess of load ?? For each hour in which the Transmission Customer schedules en? ergy in excess of its load for that hour, the Transmission Provider will reimburse the Trans? mission Customer the Decremental Cost (as de? fined below) that the Transmission Provider incurs to meet the load of the Transmission Customer in that hour. 

 
Incremental Cost to provide energy imbalance service shall be defined as the Transmission Provider's System Lambda (the out?of?pocket costs, measured in dollars per megawatt?hour, associated with producing the last MWH of energy on the Transmission Provider's system in a given hour, whether that energy is produced by owned generation or the purchase of power from a third party) to compen? 
 
sate for the under?delivery of electricity by the Trans? mission Customer for that hour.  

Decremental Cost to provide energy imbalance service shall be defined as the Transmission Provider's System Lambda (the out?of?pocket costs, measured in dollars per megawatt?hour, associated with producing the last MWH of energy on the Transmission Provider's system in a given hour, whether that energy is produced by owned generation or the purchase of power from a third party) to compen? sate for the over?delivery of electricity by the Trans? mission Customer for that hour.

Christi;  The proposed settlement procedure does not seem to be that clear... usually LDC's allow participants either a percentage of pre-schedule or set MW volumes deviation which is cleared at the appropriate Index (Mid-C, COB etc.) and then any MW volumes outside the predetermined bandwidth would be settled at a percentage of the selected Index.  Montana Power Company (MPC) has an excellent working example.  John

EES and EPMI services folk -- We would like your comments on this imbalance proposal by Portland General (FYI--to the extent that FERC accepts Portland's proposal, it could be used as precedent for other utilities): 

PGE proposed a price to clear imbalances that was rejected by the FERC.  FERC told PGE to look to the Exelon order for guidance.  After an extension, the compliance filing is due Monday.  They have sought your reaction/comments.
 
 
 They had a discussion with FERC staff on how to comply.  
 
1.  Staff agreed that, under the Order, PGE could use the average spot price (excluding long term purchases) of purchases and sales in the hour before to clear imbalances (Schedule 4).
 
2. The PGE situation does not fit the Exelon model, because PGE does not have purchases and sales in every hour (apparently Exelon did).  FERC staff agreed the situation was different, but had no suggested solutions.  Staff requested that PGE propose ""something"" and the FERC would react.
 
3.  The something is -- A variant of the proposal recently approved for Pacific Corp (?):
 
PGE would use Mid C prices, but use PGE's actual daily load shape. [Apparently, Pacific Corp. proposed Mid C prices, but would use the load shape from California.  This load shape is quite different then PGE's and could lead to arbitrage opportunities against PGE by third-parties.]
 
4.  Right now PGE's traders and outside counsel disagree on the best approach.  The traders want to just propose/use the Mid C price proposal for all hours.  Outside counsel believes they should propose/use the average spot price proposal when PGE does make purchases and/or sales in the hour before and the Mid C proposal in other hours.
 
Do you have a preference?

Sorry I was delayed with an other hot item.  Bill didn't like tying anything to prices derived in a different market (day ahead).  I'm leaning toward just using the shaped Dow Jones Non-Firm MC Index as published after the fact in the Wall street Journal.  Shaped hourly using our actual system load with the corresponding Index Price.  Attached is a spread sheet detailing the calculation with an example and a scan of how it is published.  Let me know what you think.

Any new thoughts on what we should be proposing to FERC?   I think you were going to look at a method of shaping the Mid-C index and I was wondering how that was coming.

As you know, one of our key efforts in Ontario is to build bipartisan support for opening the market in early 2002. That largely involves firming up the position of the Liberal Party (currently in opposition but in a strong position to win in the next election) in support of moving forward with competition. The Liberal Party has asked me whether Enron (really someone like Rob Milnthorp or Paul Devries) might consider being the co-chair of a fund raising event for the party in November 2001. The event would be timed for the Independent Power Producers Society of Ontario conference (the largest annual energy conference in Canada) and would be targeted at people in the Ontario energy sector. Dalton McGuinty, the leader, would speak at the event.  I didn't dismiss the idea out of hand because it may have merit if : a)  through such an event, we can secure true bipartisan support for moving forward.  (In other words, if we were to do this, the material would have to state that Rob or Paul is acting as co-chair in recognition of the bipartisan support for the deregulation initiative and how such bipartisan support is good for the Province etc); and b) we were satisfied that doing so would not alienate the governing Conservatives. (The Conservatives have always encouraged us to do what we can to keep the Liberals on side and I think they would be sophisticated enough to appreciate that efforts would involve participation in such fund raising events - particularly if the material used did not endorse the Liberals and merely recognized their support for moving forward). Let me know what you think.  Aleck (having said all this I should admit to being a Liberal)

Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.

"CBO Report - Can We Persuade FERC to Back Off Refunds?","I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.

While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators ""may"" have withheld power, the basic argument is that ""DEREGULATION ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED.""   In addition, the paper states that ""MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHES TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION.""

In addition, California's response of ""DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS.""

I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis.  The CBO finds that ""WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET""..because ""FEATURES OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET.""

Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (together with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly undercuts the ""political"" arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consumers.

Subject to receiving more information, my recommendation is not to make a ""federal case"" out of the CBO report.  In other words, we should be aware of Dave's comments and concerns, but I would not suggest we contact CBO or anything like that.  If others think some response is needed, this is the type of thing EPSA should do, if done at all.  We should refrain from carrying water for the generators.  The report is being written up favorably in the trade press I have seen, largely because the CBO report says that what California did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by deregulation.  That ""60,000 feet"" view is worth a mint politically and while there are parts of the report that we differ with, I think its value far outweighs its blemishes.

John,

My take on the paper is that is wasn't particularly flattering to the generators/suppliers.  It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had addressed and that the ISO did not implement.  It is reasonably sound as far as ""history of the formation"" is concerned but some of their statements and conclusions I have to take issue with.  

Off the top of my head, they use the term ""idle"".  In my mind as a utility person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term, they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced off or was off for maintenance, I realize it's only a word, but it carries many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding supply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case showing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high prices, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have understood the full picture.  They also don't really touch on the lack of supply side response.  According to Greg Conlin, the President of the P{UC when AB1890 in CA was designed, was a key part to the equation, they spend little, if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed.  They also give insuffucient explaination of the ""per-se"" reasonablness clause....There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later time.

I left my notes on the document back in my office, I can give you a summary early next week if that's OK.  I am currently fact gathering about PJM and NYISO congestion models with Steve Walton for RTO West...

Thanks,

Dave

Like most sources of information in DC, folks on the Hill pick and choose those that support their pre-conceived policy notions.  Having said that, the CBO is a respected source of information.  I read the summary and have the full report in my ""to read"" stack.  The summary actually made the report sound largely favorable from our perspective.  It wouldn't hurt to have a little more detail on the problems with the report as you see them so we can decide whether we need to do anthing or just be ready should a CBO witness testify at a hearing.

How much weight and influence do papers published by the CBO have with policy makers there in DC?  I have some concerns about the general tone and some of the conclusions contained in the report.  If these papers draw little attention, then , no harm, no foul.  But if policy makers tend to draw from these papers, then perhaps we need to correct or address some of the issues raised in this report.

Subject:	Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis - by the CBO

Jim,

Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by the CBO entitled, ""Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis"".  In reviewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ignore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were supposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate terms, such as ""Idle"" when describing plants that were unavailable because of maintenance or repair.

My reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on problems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in CA?  And if so, because of some of the mis-representations it contains, do we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some of the claims made in this paper?

Thanks,

Dave

Subject:	FERC recommends FL Join RTO/ Tx to delay

Florida
Bobbie McCartney, an Administrative Law Judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has recommended that Florida join its transmission lines to those of nine other states. Under the plan, Florida Power and Light Company (FPL) would turn over its transmission lines to the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or keep the lines and have the RTO manage them. The state's three major electric utilities, FPL, Florida Power Corporation, and Tampa Electric, have already formed a statewide RTO called GridFlorida. However, GridFlorida is on hold because the state is uncertain if a state RTO would increase customer rates. FPL spokesman Mike Haggerty noted, ""We will see what direction the PSC (Public Service Commission) takes before committing to any alternative."" PSC assistant director Bob Trapp said that agency staff would prefer an RTO for Florida alone, but no formal position has been taken by the commissioners.
The Palm Beach Post, September 25, 2001 
Texas
American Electric Power (AEP), owner of Southwestern Electric Power Company and West Texas Utilities Company, is supporting a delay in deregulation in East Texas from January 1 to March 31, 2003. David Carpenter, director of Texas regulatory services for AEP, said in a statement, ""We are asking that retail competition...be delayed to permit adequate time to assure that infrastructure, processes and procedures are in place to allow fair competition to proceed while reliable service continues."" However, Entergy is arguing that restructuring should move ahead even though no retail providers are making offers in that part of the state. Entergy spokeswoman Patty Riddlebarger said, ""That doesn't mean that they are not interested. Ten retail power providers have either begun or completed testing and certification in the Entergy service area."" She added that the testing and certification process is rather lengthy and companies would not be participating in them if they were not interested. Last month, Public Utility Commission staff asked commissioners to delay deregulation in that part of the state, which encompasses 60 counties and 434,000 households. AEP spokesman Larry Jones stated, ""There are a number of milestones that need to be achieved, and a delay until 2003 will allow those milestones to be achieved."" Three commission members will meet on October 5 and 6 to determine how ready the state is to begin electric competition in January.

Basically we agreed that a straightforward delegation of authority over reliability to FERC made sense for all of the groups.  Agreeing to that, the idea is to review the Bingaman language and see if our groups could agree to that language.   

I think that internally Enron is already there???  John Shelk, if you could pls send out the language to everyone on this e-mail to get agreement that would be very helpful.

INTRO EXCERPT
The Houston-based energy giant put the pursuit of profits ahead of all other
corporate goals, which fostered a climate of workaholism and paranoia.  And
that was only part of the problem.  (from the table of contents).

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything:
money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the
most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, Wall Street is
bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

Steve - 

See attached  article.  The Energy Summit turned out to be quite worthwhile and well timed, as I was able to get a better perspective of what opportunities we may have to make changes next year.  Also, had a chance to chat briefly with Chairman Connelly, Commissioner Vasington and Commissioner Keating, and others. The most telling part of the article is the last paragraph where Speaker Finneran says, ""We'll be doing some adjustments"" in legislation next year, ""Some of them may be vary large adjustments, but they will be adjustments. We're trying to formulate the phase of deregulation, an enhanced deregulation, if you will.""  My sense is that competitive Default service may be a possibility, supplier consolidated billing may also require a change to the legislation. Clearly, it is a time to try to hone in on what EES and ENA's wish list is for Mass

I met with DeTore Thursday night as well, and would like to reschedule a meeting with you and him within the next couple of weeks if possible.  

Let's discuss.

Subject: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules



I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Subject:	RE: MG Load Curtailment Option

Jim: I have participated in a number of calls with Jeff and his team over the past few weeks regarding this deal, goving over the details of how NY's demand response programs work, reviewing draft contracts, and putting him in touch with appropriate ISO staff when even more detailed followup was needed. I see little likelihood of NY's demand response programs being eliminated over the next few years given the increasingly tight supply situation the state faces and the long lead time for permitting and bulding new generation, and the great success these programs achieved this past summer. (Most folks credit the 600 MW produced by NY's day-ahead and emergency demand response programs with keeping the lights on in the northeast during the early August heat wave.) Only the day-ahead incentive program has a risk of not being continued beyond October 2003, it's current expiration date. However, even there, there is likely to be pressure to extend it for an additional year or two. With respect to potential RTO impacts, in our discussions with PJM, they have stated that at a minimum they would allow NY to continue its demand response programs in the new Northeast market on day 1, even if they differed from the rest of the region.Further, PJM would even consider making the NY programs applicable throughout the region on day 1 if that was what the market participants in the region wanted to do.

I don't know if we should pay, but I need to figure out who is on point for paying if that decision is reached.
 
I know that John Llodra is trying to sell these positions.

I left Dave Doot a message.  I need to call Monday.  Does anyone have any real options for EPMI?  I am going to suggest that we modify our credit for two options - weekly billing or wholesale sleave.  
 
At the same time, I don't think that we are in default right now - although our surety bonds are being revoked by the issuer.
 
Ed -- are we in any position to pay NEPOOL for EPMI?  When will the $$ be due?
 
Most importantly, who is making the decision that our UI/CMP/NSTAR positions should not be funded?
 
Sounds like NEPOOL is just about done with Enron and its affiliates.

David Doot left me a message that he had not heard back and he was expecting our proposal yesterday (which we had not told him).  He also said that the bonding company was ""rumbling"" that it was not going to pay.  I do not know what their obligation is to pay, but I would think that ""rumbling"" is not default, yet.

Jim S. is going to call David Doot back this afternoon.

"CA Advocacy","Dan -

Spoke with Janet Dietrich yesterday.  Slight change to our advocacy versus our Monday discussions.  After meeting with Sean Holmes, it was agreed that our policy work would say (1) no retroactive DA suspension (at least not earlier than Sept 1), (2) don't end DA but study how to allow it to continue.

If the CPUC does suspend without retroactive, the fear is that re-starting the CA market will be very difficult.

Please call me when you get some time.

Leslie,

I had sent a question to my contact in Reliant, it would seem that Reliant is working on an intervention, is this something we would want to join in with?  

As for FERC, in the filing APS I read Commission to mean FERC, when it really was referring to the ACC.

Jim,

Based on your comment, is your concern that if we do intervene and are successful, then APS would find any reason imaginable NOT to do business with Enron?

Thanks,

Dave

is this the ""we don't think there is enough wholesale competition in AZ to

am not involved , but I understand we have a  high level group that is
working on a response to APS' ludicrous filing and will be lobbying at the
ACC and AZ legislature on this one.  It is simply uncomprehensible how APS

We are having a conference call tomorrow with PGE.  They did not decide anything on the last conference call after I told them why Enron retail in the East likes the Duquense type imbalance (no bandwidth, thus no penalties-- imbalances settle at verifiable system lambda).  John Malowney of EPMI west desk likes the bandwidth, but we are discussing it further since it has created problems for the East EES desk (due to the penalties associated with being outside the bandwidth).  John likes the PGE proposal to settle at an index price, but PGE is reconsidering that aspect.  

Unfortunately, I don't know of any TPs that allow a bandwidth without penalties. 

Let me know if you want to participate in the call.

Jim-

I would like to take you up on your offer to have a private meeting with you and Rick Shapiro to discuss the different activities that took place in Enron's Government Affairs office in  Austin.  Considering Austin is one of our satellite offices, I think it would greatly benefit your department to get an insider's perspective on the office, its senior management, and the different interactions/complications that took place over my 5 month tenure in Austin.  

While I realize that ordinarily individuals at your level would not solicit the feedback of a 3rd year analyst, I feel that I have relevant information that could help you better access the situation in Austin.

My extension is 39837.

all amounts are properly due and owing.

Please feel free to contact your Account Manager Matt Pagano should you

All,
   I will be out of the office on Monday, August 13. My older son stepped on a piece of glass and cut a two inch wound in his right foot. The glass cut a main vain just under his big toe and required stitches to close the wound. Because of the area of the wound it bleeds with every turn of the foot and he MUST stay off of it for 24 to 48 hours to allow healing to begin. For this reason I am keeping him home for one day to make sure he stays off of it. 
 

   Never fear, however, I can be reached by pager and will be logged in most of the day. Please be mindful that I only have one phone line and when I am dialed in to the LAN I can not call out or receive calls.

Sure - I talked to Ed Sacks and there are some on the list that he is already working on.  I imagine that we have defaulted under the surety and the CP can now collect, but have not seen the actual notices yet.  I have asked Mary Grisaffi to forward them to Carol St. Clair for review.

I called Molly Harris, she said there wasnt any one left in her dept. and that you should be able to help with the bonds for these companies, if there is someone else I should be contact, please let me know.  

Bill, attached is a list of bonds that our broker (John L. Wortham, LLP) received a notice of cancellation on from  Fireman's Fund and Safeco.   Please determine which obligations will be required in the future.  However our broker has offered assistance in establishing a replacement surety, but you may also want to investigate alternative form of acceptable security.  

Please let me know if you need copies or if there is anything I can do to help.  Thanks.

Subject:	RE: RTO Waiver - Request for Comments

The current Grid South/ARTO/MISO/SPP scheduling model moves only limited types of transactions to the RTO.  That is those schedules that are for ""through"" transactions.  If a schedule starts or stops (source/sink) within an existing control area - that control area retains the ability to approve/deny the tag (the bastards!).  Only if the control area is ""in the middle"" or an intermediary control area in the transaction path will they not have to approve the tags.  What then is the value of the RTO other than a tariff coordinator?  My view is that control areas should relinquish all tag approval rights AND OASIS approval rights to the RTO.  They will argue that the telemetry and analysis tools is not at the RTO to do this. So - why not?

At a meeting Thursday to finalize the waiver for NERC approval, their arguments ran into a stumbling block.  Policy 3 requires that source and sink control areas must communicate directly to coordinate TLR.  Rather than seeking an exception to doing this - they all felt it best to maintain this responsibility at the source and sink control area and not assign it to the RTO Scheduling Agent.  With approvals and curtailments kept at the control area level, this jeopardizes independent judgment.

Hello  SE RTO folks

I know you all have a ton and half things going on - but I would like for you to look over the attached proposal that will be a waiver for existing control areas to assign certain control area functions over to a central RTO operator.  This waiver was originally intended for Grid South but since has expanded to include Alliance, SPP, MISO.  The purpose of the waiver is to allow for the continued existence of individual utility based control areas within an RTO AND to fulfill the FERC Order 2000 requirement that the RTO to implement Interchange Schedules.  This may become a direct conflict with our position for consolidation of control areas.

If you don't read anything else, I advise you to at least read - Sec 2.2 Rationale - 5 brief paragraphs which outlines what the RTOs want to do.   

Since I am chairman of the NERC Subcommittee that oversees Policy 3, Enron is associated with facilitating this process.  I want those working at the settlement conferences to be aware that this is coming.  Grid South's original intent was to change sections of Policy 3 to fit their new RTO structure.  I successfully argued against doing this on the basis that NERC policy should not prescribe the Grid South scheduling process and control area structure as reliability policy - hence the waiver.

Sue --
 
My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like ""CYA not Calif Youth Admin"" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  
 
Thanks,

Jim

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.  Please let me know what you would like me to do on this.  Thanks.

Subject:	Reliability Title on Transmission

I don't think the key to effective legislation to continue the opening of the transmission grid is the authority of FERC to order RTOs in itself.   It is the end state that the we hope the RTO orders can deliver that is key.  It would be a more powerful approach to line up the end state model we want for the grid into legislation - rather than fight for the ability to order formation of RTOs - then fight in settlement over what the RTO structures should be.  We should get into legislation the elimination of the fundamental drivers of discrimination that goes on today and what the utlities are trying to continue into the RTO paradigm.  We want:

1. Non-discriminatory transmission control operators - translated into real world terms as a single control area and indepdendent Security Coordinators.

2. A single transmission tariff - or comparable access rules and requirements for all generators and loads.

If the jurisdictional entities are held to these key requirements - then NERC or EISB which has the ""authority"" over the non-jurisdictional entities would begin to work in our favor. TLR rules, tagging rules, ATC calculations, redispatch - would have to be applied in the same fashion for marketers, IPPs, IOUs, Coops, Munis, BPA/TVA, etc.

These are two of the key differences between the gas industry and the electric industry.  Pipelines were separated from LDCs and producers, and there is no native load exception to inter-state pipeline access.

I think the reliability arguments some may bring up agianst these two fundamental changes are contestable and ""winnable"".  This should take away the FERC fear of jeopardizing reliability.

Subject:	Intellibridge has compiled the following report in response to yo	ur request


 10  October, 2001
To: James D. Steffes,  Enron
From: Enron  Forum
Content: Intellibridge has compiled the following report  in response to your request.
Request:
What  would be the amount of installed capacity of each of the FERC RTOs (assuming  Californiais ultimately in the  Western RTO) and what is the total peak demand in each  area?
 
Response:
 
Intellibridge estimates the following peak demand and installed capacity  figures for each of the four proposed FERC RTO regions based on the most recent  complete data available.  Peak load  data sets that were deemed complete and reliable are for 1999. Installed  capacity information is from forecasts made by NERC for 2001.
 
[IMAGE]
 
 In response to FERC  Order 2000 of 6 January  2000, utilities throughout  the United  Statessubmitted proposals to  form Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) for coordinating and controlling  electric power grid systems in their area.   FERC responded to these proposals on 12 July 2001, in a series of orders  that made clear the Commission's vision of four large, regional RTOs making up  U.S. bulk power markets.  FERC said  in these orders, ""We favor the development of one RTO for the Northeast, one RTO  for the Midwest, one RTO for the Southeast, and one RTO for the  West.""
 
Though the eventual shape and scope of the regional RTOs remains in  question, estimates of capacity and peak demand can be made based on groupings  of North American Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) regional councils or  regional ISOs and bulk power markets.   For the purposes of estimating installed capacity and peak load in these  regions, the following groupings of NERC regional councils and ISOs were assumed  to correspond to the four RTOs proposed by  FERC:
 
Northeast:
?         PJM
?         ISO-New England
?         New York ISO
 
Southeast:
?         Southeastern Electric Reliability Council  (SERC)
?         Florida Reliability Coordinating Council  (FRCC)
 
Midwest:
?         Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP)
?         Mid-American Interconnected Network, Inc.  (MAIN)
?         Southwest Power Pool (SPP)
?         Eastern Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement  (ECAR)
 
West
?         Western Systems Coordinating Council  (WSCC)
 
Peak Load  Data:
FERC  Form 714 hourly load data were used to calculate coincidental peak load for the  Midwest and Southeast RTOs.  FERC's  most recent, complete set of Form 714 data are for year 1999; FERC is still  collecting data for year 2000.  Year  1999 data were consequently used throughout for the sake of consistency.  Peak demand for the Western RTO was  taken as the 1999 annual peak reported by NERC for the WSCC in its year 2000  ""Summer Assessment"".  Coincidental  peak demand for the Northeastern RTO was calculated from 1999 hourly load data  available on the PJM, ISO-New England, and New York ISO web sites.
 
Installed  Capacity Data:
NERC  Electricity Supply & Demand for 2001. While some sets of this data for 2001  are estimates, it can be assumed that the Summer 2001 installed capacity data is  reasonably current. Other estimates can be made available.

FYI.  Note that we even had a meeting which included EES on 9/5 where the responsible party (Kelly Lovvorn) committed to certain tasks, which he obviously did not perform.  (Kelly is a contract employee.)  

Jim - there will be a charge (probably significant, especially for the ""emergency"" processing) from CSC to produce the required information.  There is some expectation that Government Affairs should be paying for it, especially since it will be a recurring item for several months.  Who should I go to to resolve this?

Unfortunately, no action was ever taken nor followed through on this request originally initiated 8/14/01, which has now 
put EES in a bind.  Suzanne Calcagno and I have decided to take ownership and will coordinate with Brenda Herod 
and CSC.

We're in the process of writing system specifications and will forward an ""emergency"" request for data to Brenda and CSC
this afternoon.   

Becky Cantrell will submit a request for an extension to FERC as soon as we determine how quickly CSC can produce the
information required.

Please note, no further action from any other group will be required.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Subject:	FERC Data Request - Reporting Requirements for period 8/1/01 - 1/1/02

Suzanne,

Please be advised that Kelly Lovvorn (x5-8997) will coordinate the FERC data requirements with IT personnel for the EES Systems.
I passed on all the details regarding data specifications and a high level overview of ENAs plan.

The EES data will need to be pulled from all Settlement applications which include HP9000, STAT, and Altra.  Kelly does
have a few programming resources available in house, yet he may need to request the information from CSC.  If that is the
case, there will be costs associated with the data pull and it will be much more difficult to validate the data.  In addition, there
may also be timing issues (????)....

I have asked Kelly to coordinate directly with you as he has questions/concerns.  You may want to check back with him in a few days to
workout target dates for your team to actually receive the information, who he should forward info to, etc...

Thanks,

dg

(note:  Just as an ""extra"" thought....as long as we Settle out of Altra/HP/Stat, all FERC data 
 requests (involving pricing w/ volumetric actuals) will need to come from those systems.)

Subject:	HOME DEPOT, ETC --- TEXAS CUSTOMERS GREATER THAN 1 MW

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms =

TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.

4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.

5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.

6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.

Per Jim, Enron is going to participate in EPSA's cost benefit analysis for the SE RTO.  Mirant and possibly others have said that they will perform a cost benefit analysis for the Midwest.  We are not going to participate in those.  (Please keep in mind that Enron did the ""natural markets studies"" for the SE and the NE).  Thanks.

Jim,

My apologies for the delayed response, however, I was on vacation when you sent the original note.  I spoke to Sue Tuesday or Wednesday of last week and she was going to send me the contacts info at AReM's  PR office so that we could put the customer's in direct contact with that individual.  As you have seen I have requested contact information from Origination and Service Management, however, I would still like to have the PR contact's info in case we have a customer only willing to speak directly to AReM's PR.  

Let me know if that is something you can provide.

Lamar --

It is critical that every customer in California that switched (signed new or renewal customer) during this year.  We need a contact person for each account.  The key to securing a better date is to have the customers push the Governor and the Legislature and the CPUC.

We are able to provide phone numbers and contacts through our trade groups.

I'll certainly give it more thought, but I think that a discussion of
reporting requirements would be timely.  The NOPR on power transaction and
contracts is out there, but has not got much attention yet due to the press
of California issues and the RTO negotiations.  Also, on October 1, entities
selling gas in California have to make their first monthly report to FERC on
purchases, sales, and transportation contracts.  Additionally, the DOE has
changed some of its annual reporting requirements.  In all cases,
confidentiality is an issue, and I believe that it is handled differently
for each of these reports.  A discussion of all these requirements from a
practical ""how to"" or ""do's and don'ts"" perspective might not be sexy, but
it would be useful to us preoccupied regulatory slugs...

Do either of you have any suggestions for topics to focus on at the

talked about market-based rate issues; the one before that, gas issues.  We
had thought of a ""dialogue"" with some senior FERC staff and a few of our
members about big picture issues, but haven't been able to organize it.  We
could try that again.  Or, what about interconnection issues or information
collection/disclosure, since those seem to be rocketing up FERC's priority
list.  Any suggestions?

Subject:	Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion, Nov. 20..... 

RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, 
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and 
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

DATE - TIME - LOCATION

Tuesday, November 20 
8:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
EB 8C1   

Video conference and teleconference capabilities are available.

FYI. Apparently we turned back sales customers in Arizona served by Southwest Gas but we are still on the hook for their gas costs.  Altho I was in contact with EES virtually daily since December on about the SW problems, I was told that we were able to terminate their contracts, and was not aware of the lingering exposure issue on pricing until I started getting emails last week.  Needless to say I am not pleased and EES is trying to find a regulatory fix to this problem.  If I had known about it last winter, I would have been able to explain it to them.  I don't think I can get this fixed, and they should have kept the customers, as the delivery problems cleared up in the spring.

Subject:	RE: Southwest Gas 

On cash-outs, Southwest takes the highest price paid for any incremental volume and applies it to all cash out volumes.  This is the issue we took up at the ACC and argued that it should be based on actual costs, not the single highest price.  BUT this is a different issue than the actual cost of gas for sales purposes.  I would think that the sales gas is based on actual incremental costs.  There is a possibility this can be audited, but we would have to go to the ACC, and as in California, they will not be at all sympathetic to us. They will view this an Enron problem.  I just say that so that you don't think that I can fix this easily (I doubt that I can fix this at all, but let's see what we get from the ACC on the cash out issue, that will be a good indicator.  We were clearly right on that one).

Leslie-
Is there any way to know what their incremental cost of gas is or how it is calculated?  For example, if SW Gas buys 10,000 MMBtu total for the month at $5.00 and all other purchases were at $3.00, and EES' sales gas for that month was 90,000 MMBtu, can they charge $5.00 for all 90,000?  Are there any audit rights?  Also, I heard that we hired a law firm awhile back to address this issue???  Do you know anything about that or what they did/accomplished?  You may be hearing more about this from Don Black or Jess Hewitt--there is a huge concern about our exposure this winter.

I assume you found the Southwest Gas Nevada tariff online and checked that rate schedules there?  the commodity cost was $.49390 and there is also a balancing account adjustment.  They file to change their PGA once a year and this year they have proposed no change.

1.	Could the company include distribution wires as well, instead of being just a transmission only wires?
2.	How many shares would a divesting company get?  Could this be more that 5%?  If so, wouldn't this be over the ""control"" threshold?

In general, I fully support this type of action.

Subject:	Transmission Divesture and Tax Policy

Jim, Sarah and Rick,

	The following describes the suggestion that I made in our meeting this morning.  This is a strategy which could only be executed in legislation.  

The Problem:

One of the chief difficulties of forming a Transco are the tax consequences of divestiture of assets. The problem was identified in 1995 when we first started talking about a Transco in the West.   If the parties agree in advance of divesture to combine their assets with others into a new company, the divestiture creates a tax event.  As a result, the Transco's like Alliance or TransConnect have adopted an LLC structure to avoid the tax consequences of formation.  The problem with the LLC form is the reluctance of the owners to surrender all control of their assets to the Managing Member who has ""little skin in the game.""  Questions have also been raised by opponents about the fiduciary responsibilities of Managing Member.  Are they to look out of the financial interests of the owners (passive and active)?  All these issues came up when we were working with various companies in 1999-2000 on possible pipe/wire companies.

The Suggestion:

Create a short window during which utilities could divest their assets into a Transco without facing a tax penalty.  Under such a provision, current owners would be allowed to agree in advance to combine their assets to form a new company without taxes being levied on the spin off, as long as the new company was a transmission only company.  The shareholders of the contributing companies would received publicly traded shares in the new company, so there is no issue of the original company controlling the Transco.  The Federal Treasury is tax neutral, since without the provision the Transco doesn't form.  When the shareholders of Transco sell their shares, the are taxable, if the Transco becomes more valuable, then the benefit accrues to Treasury in taxes on the sale of the stock.  With a two year window, the companies would be faced with a one time opportunity to make the shift and avoid taxes.  This become a trigger for breaking up the vertical integration for which a business case can be made the shareholders of today's owners are better off.


	Thanks for listening (reading).

Steve

Leslie has struggled mightily with this in light of the constant changes that have been going on and we are sure more changes will be necessary.

Comments must be filed at FERC by December 20.  In order to allow adequate time for a couple of redrafts and the concomitant reviews along with the other things that are going on, please advise me or Leslie of any suggestions, concerns or comments you have by COB MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26th.

Below is Carin's very helpful and well done summary of the report together with links to the CFA press release and the full report.  While we will sharply disagree with their comments on restructuring results in the states, we should be able to make use of their latest comments on the critical need to separate transmission from generation to avoid discrimination.

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on Pipeline Capacity Recall

?			Comments due November 19th
?	Conference Call November 14th
?
As discussed on the last Gas Issues Working Group conference call, attached are draft EPSA comments on FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on pipeline capacity recall.  EPSA opposes the NOPR because it (a) will reduce competition in the secondary market for transportation services and (b) may reduce the pipeline operational flexibility needed by electric generators.   Thus, EPSA urges the Commission not to impose a broad based recall requirement throughout the natural gas industry but rather gain experience with this difficult issue in individual Order No. 637 proceedings.

Please review the draft and forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Jack Cashin at EPSA at jcashin@epsa.org by noon on Thursday, November 15th so that we can make a timely filing by Monday, November 19th.  EPSA will hold a conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 1:00 P.M. (EST) to discuss the draft.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Jack Cashin/EPSA Call.

I just wanted to second Sue's motion about the idea of a map to demonstrate the visual and substantive clarity of FERC's Super RTO model.  The map could be augmented with information on how those regions come closer to be aligned with actual power needs and flows.  I recall attending an EPSA conference for congressional staff soon after I arrived (June or so) which showed the crazy quilt-like map of the then-proposed RTOs that just looked unworkable.  The simplicity of the Super RTO model -- combined with some basic power idea -- will be a powerful lobbying tool.

Subject: RE: Information request


Janel----as you know, most of the interaction on RTOs that I have had is with the Governors, and more specifically the western govs, so my comments are directed to them, but I think these suggestions could work for other influencers as well.
 
RTOs are not a readily understandable issue for a governor who has 50-100 issues every week to cover, nor is there a natural constituency that would politically support a governor getting involved, nor is it an issue that they care about---they just want the lights to go on and their voters to have moderate prices and reliability and for the energy crisis to go away if they perceive that it is affecting them.  Those that know a little bit about the RTOs are following their incumbent utility lead in opposing a west wide RTO, they are invoking the ""states rights"" mantra, and they don't want to be in the same  playground as California. 
 
I would suggest that we need materials/information (probably a power point of 5-8 pages)as follows:
 
    1  A description of the RTOs and generally what our position is, in plain english, in 3 sentences or less.
 
    2.  A minimum of 2 or 3 analogies to a well designed RTO.  The analogies need to be fleshed out...ie, cover all objections and questions.  The one that comes to mind is Eisenhower and the federal highway system--when/how it happened; who protested and why they were wrong; how great the highway system was for the economy and quality of life, etc.  Governors need something they can use as a sound bite and something they understand well to use as an analogy.  They do not want to look stupid, and most of them know little about energy, and so we need to give them something very simple to use as their underlying reasoning for supporting our position.
 
    3  Identify and describe only the the 2 or 3 most important, specific issues that we need to see addressed in the RTOs---native load exemption gone/congestion management solutions/timing or whatever Steffes and team identify.
 
    4. Specifically set out what the objections of other parties would be to the governor supporting our position on those 3 issues identified.  (this is key in making sure that they trust our information, and it also makes sure that they are prepared to answer the objections)  Specifically set out what the answer is to overcome those objections.
 
    5. Provide positive effects of a governor agreeing with the 2 or 3 issues--why he/she should  take our position ie better reliability, more transmission or generation will be built if system is truly open, keep them from getting screwed by California, etc.
 
    6.  somewhere in here we also need a very simple map so they can visualize what RTOs are.

Today I contacted our friends at Frontier Economics and at Tabors Caramanis about developing a set of talking points and leave-behinds for future RTO meetings (outside of the mediation process) with Governors, State Legislatures, Utility Commissioners and Members of Congress.  
 
In order to adequately provide us with the materials we need, both firms are interested in getting a better idea of the following:
 

who (which individuals) are raising concerns about the RTO Concept that FERC/Enron are advocating 
what specifically are the arguments these critics are making against the single, mandatory RTO concept? 
What are the priority issues that need addressing in your regions?  (We'll probably have to develop different documents depending on who we are talking with).

Each of you contacted me this week about wanting to meet with various policymakers in order to address their concerns and deliver our message.  Before you schedule your meetings, I think it's important to arm you with materials that can be left behind that summarize and/or outline your arguments for a single RTO.  Your feedback is important so PLEASE send me an email by Thursday outlining the feedback you've recently received and topics that you want Frontier Economics and TC to address.
 
Time is of the essence so please send me whatever thoughts you have so that I can forward to FE and TC.  
 
Thanks!

2.  Win Supreme Court case 
3.  Get good legislative language (or kill bad bills)

As I discussed earlier with Rick, sasha Jacob is leaving GPC at the end of the month to join another firm.  sash is particularly valuable becuase of his impeccable connections with Jim Wilson (the Minister of energy) and the staffers on the government side of the Legislature.  What I wouldn't mind talking through with you is the continuing need for assistance re the media here, as Tom McLaren proposes. I think we need it and Peter Varley would be good to work with in that regard - he is the Premier's former Press Secretary and has conections with the major Toronto dilies that have proved helpful.

Importance: High


Aleck:

Further to our phone call, as promised I am sending you this e-mail to
confirm our interest in ensuring that Enron Canada can secure the consulting
resources it requires at the current time to ensure an expeditious and
assured opening of Ontario's electrical power market. As well, as you know
we have superior resources in Alberta and elsewhere to augment your
government relations, media and public affairs resources.

I would like to meet with you today or early Wednesday to discuss an amended
going-forward task assignment for GPC, given the likelihood of assigning the
Queen's Park contact program to Sasha, or his new firm. I would ask that
should you be successful in concluding an engagement agreement with Sasha or
his firm that you inform us and I will have our in-house counsel confirm the
removal of any restrictive covenants that Sasha has with GPC that would
prevent him from doing consulting work with you.  

While the contact program you want Sasha to work on is key to your
objectives, it is nonetheless only one element of a comprehensive campaign,
so whatever your arrangements with Sasha or his firm may be, we see GPC's
critical areas of support as follows.


	*	GPC would continue to provide strategic advice on the
overall program to secure Enron Canada's market opening in Ontario,
including advice to you on the Queen's Park Contact Program. Assuming that
you will be working with Sasha to execute the Queen's Park contact program,
we still believe that our assessment of the situation will be very valuable,
particularly with the opposition parties and for giving you an independent
back channel to gauge your success. 

	*	GPC would also provide advice to you on the management of
other important stakeholders, such the municipal utilities, major power
consumers, consumer and environmental/social advocates and others who may
slow down or derail the market reforms.

	*	Regarding the opposition parties, we endorse your strategy
of maintaining the current support of the Official Opposition Liberals. GPC
is well positioned to assist in this political arena. It should be separated
from the government program in our view if possible.

	*	The media will also perform a pivotal role in shaping the
public's understanding of the issue. In this respect, we would recommend
that GPC's Peter Varley assist you. Our approach would be to ensure that the
major media outlets in key government constituencies are targeted to have an
accurate and favourable response to Enron Canada's position. Ideally, we
would work to ensure that these outlets are proactively supportive of the
market opening in their respective editorial positions and that Enron is a
preferred media contact. This would enable you be in a better position to
shape the media debate. To accomplish this we would recommend both a
proactive and reactive approach - i.e., media plan, contact program, program
delivery and day-to-day monitoring and rapid response (Aleck this is much
like we did for project Stanley).

	*	GPC would also develop all collateral materials for all
audiences including the media, government, regulators and market
stakeholders. This would include briefing notes, Q&A, media releases, policy
papers etc.

	*	Outside Ontario, there are other concerns, including some
current issues underway in Alberta, which Enron Canada should be alerted to
from time to time and GPC can help you understand those concerns as they
arise and assess the value of strategic intervention.  
	
As we discussed, I will be the overall account manager for GPC and I
strongly recommend that you, Sasha and I meet as a team twice a month to
coordinate our efforts and to exchange intelligence.  

I have also reviewed our current contractual arrangement with you (our
letter agreement from 08 June 2000) and I believe a new contract is not
required as our current contract would seem to be appropriate. It sets out a
comprehensive set of deliverables which covers all the points I have
outlined above, and an agreed understanding between you and me on a budget
will fit within the terms of that contract.

Once again Aleck, thanks for your support and patience and, as you can tell,
we value your business very highly. 

I will call you to set up a convenient time to meet to ensure this overview
is consistent with our discussions and also to review with you the members
of the GPC team.

Subject:	RE: CA question

Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

Subject:	Latest Legislative Version of Direct Access --08.22.01

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly. 

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

Best,
Jeff

Jim,

This is a 3 year deal, beginning Oct. 1.  Our standard terms and conditions, which MG has already executed, includes a ""regulatory"" out provision.  In addition, a change in law allows EES to terminate.

If ICAP or UCAP goes away, this would be a material change and EES would try to renegotiate the deal with MG or terminate if an acceptable deal cannot be reached.

Good mark ups.  Thanks.
Originally, I purposely excluded acknowledging the need for a forum to develop non-physical/pure financial standards.  I was not sure if this was an issue we could win buy-in from other marketers that NERC establish business practices.

However, on the EPSA-NAERO Working Group conference call today, one member suggested we alert NERC and FERC to the fact that ""business practices"" have the hardest impact on the marketers and IPPs.  And if NERC is going there - then the likes of EPSA and ELCON become the major staekholders in that forum.  I think this is a great twist to the old ""reliablity first approach"" of NERC  and can give us major leverage.  I will bolster this point in the write-up.

EPSA will draft a letter to be sent to Mike Gent explaining what EPSA members support.  It will be based upon a ""checklist"" of issues similar to this write-up.  I would like to get this write-up into Mark Bennett's hands to incorporate into the letter and see if other EPSA members can support it.  We may still want to send this write-up directly to Dave Nevius and Mike Gent since, they approached us directly.

Additionally, EPSA members agreed that we should continue the parallel development of EISB and NERC.  But - take an active role in the formation of the 4th quadrant of EISB.  DOE has offered to host a forum for an industry effort to kick-start the 4th quadrant.  Mark Bennett has been talking with Rae McQuade at GISB and she told him that NERC, as an organization, cannot be folded under the EISB umbrella.  FERC would have liked such a simple solution, they want the expertise/experience of NERC - and the fair process of GISB.  So, the challenge is 
a) migrate the NERC expertise into the EISB, or
b) transform the NERC structure into an EISB like structure

NERC is proceeding at Warp Factor 10 in making a transition into the new One-Stop Shop. EPSA members believe that NERC leading this charge will certainly result in the marketers geting the short endf as we did with the Blue Ribbon Panel of a few years ago.  EPSA members want an open and inclusive forum for shaping the new organization.  That is the justification for participating in the DOE sponsored forum - to challenge NERC leading this charge.  This concern will also be expressed in the EPSA letter.

"RE: Direct Access","Angela -

The value proposition for a customer is related to which buckets of cost would be bypassed by switching to DA.  If a customer goes DA after August 24, 2001 (based on the discussion about surcharges in the legislation that has only passed the Assembly Energy Committee last night - with still a very low probability of success of being signed by the Governor), the customer would pay for SCE undercollection (PG&E isn't being discussed on this piece), DWR bond costs, and DWR net unavoidable.   The hardest piece to calculate - which Belden said on the last call he simply couldn't given the tremendous uncertainty - is the DWR net unavoidable.  If the customer has been DA since July 1, the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable (but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else).

Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be - the key question I'd ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open.

Of course, all of this assumes that the CPUC doesn't go back and suspend DA even earlier than July 1 or something else crazy happens - remember this is California.

Thanks for the info.  While there may be some differences in presentation, there don't appear to be any basic differences in the analysis.  All of the discussions of the legislation need to be aware that the passage is highly uncertain.

I agree with the analysis that if you have never been DA and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge (assuming the legislation passes).  

Let me know if there is anything else.

All:
A lot of runors are swirling around.  There is legislation pending right
now as I write this e-mail.  The outcome is uncertain.  But here is what I
know and what I have been working on for BOMA.
First, the CPUC continues to threaten that it will suspend DA on September
6th, including any DA contract signed since last January.  The PUC has
threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending
action on the issue by the legislature.  Even if the PUC were to act, the
legislature could override their action with a statute.  But I anticipate
that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering
the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September
14th.
The real action is in the legislature.  There is a comprehensive bill -- SB
78XX, the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison.
For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen, the Governor and the
Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison.  Here
are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it:

1) The state would securitize $2.9 billion in bonds to help SCE pay its
debts.  Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use 20kW or
more in peak daily demand.  That would translate to about 0.06 (as in
6/100ths) of a penny per kW.  The original proposal was to place the
bailout burden only on SCE customers who use 500kW peak demand, which would
have been maybe 1.5 cents per kW (since the base would have been much
smaller), but  we beat that back to the current proposal of 20kW.

2) The Edison surcharge would be non-bypassable.  That means that Edison
customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or
from a DA contractor.  If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the
Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying!

3) The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand (load) which
exceeds supply as calculated as follows: DWR contracts + IOU retained
generation + IOU long term contracts.  If this delta, or headroom exists as
of 1/1/03, then, per PUC regs,which are yet to be devloped, the Calif.
Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount
of headroom, without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee.  (An
exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a
customer for the customer's proportional share of the state's stranded
costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR, but for which there
is no market.)  If no headroom exists, a customer still could go DA, but
pay the exit fee to do so.

4) A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended.
Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to
1/17/01 to continue without penalty.  It looks like contracts signed
between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty,
but that date is not definite.  Contracts signed between June and August
24th would also be permitted, but may have to pay some sort of retroactive
exit fee, on a sliding scale, depending on the date they were signed.  All
DA contracts after August 24th would be subject to the 1/1/03 schedule
described in #3 above.

In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers, and exit fees for
DA customers when no headroom exists, there will be another surcharge for
all non-municipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since
January 17th.  That surcharge would be to payoff $13 billiion in state
revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR
bought since January.

Where does BOMA, and the rest of the business community stand on these
issues?

1) BOMA has been O.K. with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric
customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan. 17,
when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market
power.

2) While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR
long term contracts, we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for
them, and wants to be held harmless for their costs.  BOMA and other
business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated
or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without
exit fees.

3) BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any
surplus electricity revenues after the first $500 million to ratepayers
based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate
payments.  This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on
customers who have experienced rate increases greater than 50% in the last
few months.

4) Finally, BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison.  But the
Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone
he can see, including all business groups, to help get it enacted.  In that
light, BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers, residential as well
as business pay the debt.  The legislature, however, did not want to pass
this cost on to residential customers, so then it became a fight over where
the consumer threshold would be.  As stated above, we have suceeded in
getting it as low as 20kW peak demand.  (NOTE:  There are those that feel
it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to
get the state out of the energy business.  You can decide for yourselves.)

5) It should also be noted that the Edison, bond and DWR surcharges may all
be covered in the existing rates you are now paying.  That is to say that
there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since
the market price for power has come down substantially.  But this remains
to be seen.

There is more to this package and moer to come i9n terms of changes.  The
committee is going back in at 6:30 this evening and we will see what
happens.  I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation.

Subject:	Draft revisions to the 9/6/01 Bingaman reliability provision

Enclosed is my draft of possible revisions to the above-referenced reliability provision, taking into
account suggestions by Craig. I have enclosed a redline version and a clean one. The revision does
the following:
1.By adding""without hindering reliable, non-discriminatory, and efficiently priced transmission service""
it uses words of art from FERC Order No. 2000 and shows the intertwined nature of security and commercial practices.
2.By adding the reference to section 201(f), it specifically includes  Federal and State entities.
3.There is no named reference for any particular industry  standards body---thus no attempt to either
provide an advantage or disadvantage to any existing body.
4.The FERC could take into consideration recommendations of enties with technical expertise regarding reliability standards---such as WECC , Regional Advisory Bodies, and the States.
5. FERC could assign enforcement responsibility in a given area to any appropriate entity---such as WECC or RTOs.
6.It puts in a definition of reliability standards that is limited to security and, by not including adequacy, is
not as intrusive on prerogatives of States.
7.I bracketed the possibility of a States savings provision for further consideration. Of course, the
narrower the scope---i.e. no consideration of generation adequacy---the less need there is for such
a provision.
Please give me any feedback.

I have contacted both the utility and the energy services company (only Reliant so far) to find out how our IT folks can obtain the same data.  As expected, Reliant has been less than willing to answer the question directly.  I have left voice mail with the Regulatory VP twice.  He gets one more chance.

I pulled up TXU Energy Services' website and did a little browsing. Do you think the retail energy services group is utilizing information re: customer accounts that the regulated utility has? i.e. consumption data, current pricing, etc? If so, isn't this illegal under the electricity Code of Conduct rules in Texas? If any end user in TU's territory could access that type of information through the retail website, I would think it would be a problem.

Any thoughts?

Subject:	GA Gas: Did Deregulation Work?

Gas deregulation: unfulfilled promises It was meant to foster competition, lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians. It hasn't. 
MATTHEW C. QUINN 
STAFF 

Nov. 4, 2001 
Atlanta Journal/Atlanta Constitution 
Home 
Page E.1 
(Copyright, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - 2001) 

Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas, there's widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed. 

When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to 1.5 million homes and businesses, the goal was to drive prices down and improve service. 

Instead, here's what resulted: A relentless wave of billing errors, confusion and customer service complaints. Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged. Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winter's record cold. Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills. Three marketers have gone bankrupt, reducing competition. Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on.

The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong. No easy fixes are at hand.

""No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what they've had to go through,"" said Paula G. Rosput, chief executive of AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co., which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in 1997 and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers.

Rosput, who joined the company in 1998 when deregulation was already under way, now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably ""swimming against the tide.""

Georgia's relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit, she said. Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly.

""There's plenty of blame to go around here,"" she said, noting that ""never in the history of Georgia"" has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide.

Gov. Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass. He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January. Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers, but he has ""profound concerns"" about the impact on consumers.

Barnes said he's not out to scrap deregulation. That's a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature, along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures.

The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in. According to Atlanta Gas Light, more than 50,000 consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected.

The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored, except in certain hardship cases.

The PSC has allocated $10 million to help low-income senior citizens pay their bills, and the federal government has kicked in $15 million for low-income families --- but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers. 

As a result, social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers. The Sullivan Center, a southwest Atlanta nonprofit, is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills.

Many of them haven't paid since last winter's frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country. 

The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut- offs --- but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term. When the moratorium expired in April, more than 220,000 customers were targeted for disconnection, and marketers were stuck with a reported $100 million in bad debt. Since then, 142,000 homes and businesses have been shut off; 87,500 of those were reconnected after paying their bills.

Nancy D. Coveny, executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry, which offers assistance to low-income residents, said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies. Before deregulation, ""it was a lot easier"" to straighten out problems, Coveny said. ""We would call Atlanta Gas Light. We had relationships.""

High prices

Jessie Champion, 54, of southwest Atlanta, said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a $2,081 bill dating back months.

Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light, and was told by the company that ""the computer messed up."" She's been using an electric heater for her household, which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son. 

Catherine Land-Waters, vice president/customer service at Georgia Natural Gas, said Champion's service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments. She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored.

Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move. She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas, even though she sent a check. Service was restored two days later, but only after she ""yelled and screamed"" and complained to the PSC. ""I have to have gas,"" she said. ""I have seven children."" 

Dave Benfield, a spokesman for Infinite, said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection. The small, Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment.

""If people don't pay us in 45 days, they get a notice,"" Benfield said. ""In most cases they pay.""

The PSC has logged more than 12,000 complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing, billing inaccuracies, disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances. That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications.

""People aren't being treated right,"" says PSC member Stan Wise, a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system. 

Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out, and complaints to the PSC have tapered off.

What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas. When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months, residential prices charged by marketers remained high. Last week, wholesale prices shot up 75 percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year.

Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers. The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch. 

It's not clear ""how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation,"" said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley.

Reeling from bad debt

Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation. Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not.

But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price, which was not heavily promoted as an option. 

A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities. The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was $37.12, compared with an average of $27.03 for six regulated utilities in nearby states. Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average.

But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service, plus Atlanta Gas Light's distribution charges. PSC member Robert Baker says AGL's charges, which account for 40 percent of typical bills, may be partly to blame for high bills.

On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to $52.5 million a year above what's authorized, the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates. AGL, meanwhile, claims it's entitled to a rate increase of up to $48 million.

With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers, it's hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks.

Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas. What was supposed to be Georgia's gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted. That touched off an array of billing problems and errors. When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed, many consumers, already angered by the billing problems, blamed deregulation --- and didn't pay their bills. 

While those problems were evolving in Georgia, California had its electricity implosion. Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation they'd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services, including electricity and telecommunications. But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity. ""California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power,"" said Warren Darby, retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia, S.C.

When Georgia's moratorium on shut-offs expired in April, marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated $100 million in bad debt. Instead of building market share, they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers.

""You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality,"" Darby said.

Shell Energy, an affiliate of Shell Oil Co., recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas. The crash program by Georgia's No. 3 marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints. Darby said Shell is ""circling the wagons.""

Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia ""has not been an exciting profit picture for us,"" but he insists his company has no plans to pull out. He added, however: ""Unless things get better, no company can survive this.""

Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer, has been one big headache for AGL Resources, its parent, which recently took a $13.5 million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner. ""It's not been a good business for us,"" said Rosput of AGL.

No. 2 marketer Scana Energy has reported $4 million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year, or about $1 per month per customer after accounting for bad debt. The South Carolina-based company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses. The company says it's in for the long term.

New Power Co. made a late and aggressive entry into Georgia's natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets. Wall Street didn't like the idea. The company's stock has plunged from $21 a year ago to less than $1. Its top financial backer, Enron Corp., last month wrote down about $270 million of its investment. But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that it's not planning to pull out.

Still, there's concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits. The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business. 

The ranks of marketers has already thinned from 19 three years ago to eight. The top four control 94 percent of the market.

PSC member Baker already sees an ""oligopoly"" with limited competition. Consumer choice ""is supposed to be the hallmark"" of deregulation, said Commissioner David Burgess. Instead, he said, ""consumers have less and less.""

'Re-regulation' calls

So far, no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems. 

Calls for ""re-regulation"" are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January. Already, a key backer of the 1997 deregulation law has jumped ship.

""We can't let Georgia consumers suffer for another year,"" said state Sen. Sonny Perdue of Bonaire, who said he will introduce legislation to re-regulate natural gas. Perdue, the main Senate sponsor of the 1997 deregulation law, is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. He would oppose Barnes. 

State Rep. Jimmy Skipper (D-Americus), the main House sponsor of the '97 law, said he's concerned about gas prices, but he's not sure re-regulation is ""doable at this point.""

Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance. 

""We believe a year from now, weather permitting, that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have,"" saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love.

Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems, including dilemma No. 1: ""If it's re-regulated, who takes the ball?"" says PSC Chairman Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald Jr.

Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for 1.5 million customers, which was turned over to marketers.

Then there's the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a ""bailout"" to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into. 

One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light --- or even a marketer --- offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers. That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated.

Other measures could include new standards for billing, customer service and meter reading; more authority for the PSC, including emergency power to regulate prices; reducing the sales tax for gas bills; and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers.

But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for ""fixing"" deregulation. In fact, there may be no good fix.

Rosput said she's ""prepared to get to a solution,"" but like everyone else, she doesn't have an answer.

""It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship,"" she said, ""and there's no safe shore or good place to land.""

Joe, 

I requested a meeting with you yesterday to work with you and convey what we have learned over the last three months by working with regulatory and the ERCOT ISO to utilize and create additional LSE accounts.  As you were informed by Nancy Hetrick of regulatory all three currently available LSE account are committed by Structured Supply for use under currently negotiated masters.  We requested the meeting with you yesterday to explain what we were doing and why we needed the other three EES LSE accounts.  We also took the time to explain the process for establishing new LSE accounts, under a LLC structure which is not complicated, but the structure that the new LSE accounts would be created under (SPV) is inconsistent with the masters negotiated and EES would not be able to perform under these masters.

We have tried to work with you in cooperation to accomplish your goals consistent with the constraints of the ERCOT rules.  We have explained our needs and the reason for them. We conveyed our interest in working together to accomplish the greater good for the company and offered our help in any way we could.  You mark and I agreed that it would be easier to help each other and not duplicate efforts.  We were appreciative of your willingness to proceed consistent with this spirit of cooperation.  It disheartens and surprises me that you would leave the meeting with this understanding and in agreement of the business situation and send an e-mail the next morning, without picking up the phone or stopping by to discuss this and just attempt to dictatorially commandeer the LSE accounts that you knew were committed and why they were committed.  

Moreover; you told us that you thought you might need one more and you have attempted to take three more. 

Best regards, 


Jeff

Christi & Jim,

	The Wyoming Energy Commission has a meeting on  Tuesday and Wednesday in Laramie.  Since they pay for travel, I am going to be leaving tomorrow and coming back on Thursday afternoon  (driving back to Denver to fly home).  If you need to reach me for anything I will have my cell phone, however, the outside connection for the computer is cut off, so I can only get e-mail when I come into the office.  I will come into the office on Friday morning.

Do we need to specifically rebut this?  Enron did file a study to support the natural markets of the SE, and, while we generally have stated responses to his issues in various forums, do we need to respond item by item?  (FYI--I have never heard the ""lake"" analogy before -- his characterization of it as the opponent position helps his case, but it is incorrect because as far as I know, there is no one proposing a system that ignores constraints).

Also, we have not focused much recently on the transmission pricing issues.  This may be an opportunity to discuss this in context.  He seems to use it as a reason against the Southeast RTO.

Below is a link to Southern Co. CEO Allen Franklin's prepared testimony at the Barton hearing last week (October 10).  He says they favor wholesale competition, but he then goes on to talk about the virtues of geographically smaller RTOs, with a phased approach of smaller RTOs that could later merge to become larger (although the Barton discussion draft would prevent such mergers).  The statement also chronicles their involvement in the Southeast mediation process.

In his oral testimony, Franklin kept ephasizing the lack of FERC cost/benefit studies on RTOs and the similar (alleged) lack of studies and analysis to support the 4 RTO model.

With regard to ERCOT:

Ponderosa Pine is the Cleburne IPP that we purchased from Tenaska last year--it is sometimes called ""Cornhusker"".  Brazos Electric Coop is the power purchaser under a long-term PPA.

There is no capacity available or committed under the DC tie (""TexMex"" or ""Salsa"").  The project is not fully developed, however, an application for a Presidential Permit is in process.  We do have agreements with the Brownsville Public Utility Board related to the development of the project--Dave Forster is the commercial contact.

The only construction in progress I am aware of is Indian Mesa I & II (Enron Wind Projects)--I will follow-up with you tomorrow on this.

We have a Services Agreement with the Fronterra project.  I believe AEP is the owner.  Enron has no equity ownership, only management responsibility--Tom May is the commercial contact.

I cannot think of anything else, but I will talk with a few others tomorrow.  I would encourage you to also check with Dave Forster, head of origination for the central U.S.

Hope this helps.

I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  

The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?
  
Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?  
Do we have any construction in progress?  
Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?

Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?

Subject:	OHIO MSG

The sales agreement provides that we may terminate the sales agreement immediately without any further obligation if we do not receive an allocation of market support generation.

An ""event of default"" under the sales agreement (e.g. filing of bankruptcy) will automatically establish an ""Early Termination Date"" and may trigger payment of an ""Early Termination Payment"".

I have not been able to find the provisions, yet, that would cause rescission of MSG.  I will have to continue that in the morning.

However, as a nonlawyer, an interesting question arises in terms of chicken or the egg.  It seems like it would be better to lose MSG and terminate the contract without any further financial obligation, than to be in default of the contract and pay an Early Termination Payment.  Will continue to research in the morning.

Subject: ASE Dinner -- Enron Vice Chair Request....
Importance: High


Mike, Linda, Dave and Jim,

We received a request from the Alliance to Save Energy (www.ase.org) for Enron to be a Vice Chair of the annual dinner on October 24, 2001 in DC.

-- Enron is a member (Associate) of ASE

-- Enron has been a Vice Chair for the previous 9 years  

-- The letter of invitation was sent to Ken Lay on July 3, 2001.

-- The Vice Chair level is 10 K and covers the cost of a table. 

-- This year's award recipients are Gov. Pataki (R-NY) and the ESCO Industry - Enron would be eligible to receive the award as part of the industry group at the dinner.

-- Senators Bingaman and Jeffords and Rep. Boehlert are expected to give out the awards.

Invitations are going to print first thing tomorrow morning and will list the Vice Chairs to date -- but we can commit to the Vice Chair level after the print deadline and we will be recognized at the event.

-- There is also an opportunity for Enron to speak at their Associate's policy seminar on Oct. 25, Energy Secretary Abraham has been invited to be the keynote speaker at the seminar.

Please let me know if you would be willing to pay for, our contribute to, the cost of the table/Vice Chair level.

Please see the invite below.

Thanks and I apologize for the short notice.

-Lisa

Subject:	RE: FW: Midwest ISO Joint Petitioners' Proposed Settlement Agreement - IURC C...

Janine:

Below is a short response I have drafted if we choose to respond (although it is not clear to me that a response is necessary) to these emails.  I'm a little unclear about the positions of the people in the emails.  I think our best response to Ron (Cinergy) is that MISO does not serve load, so MISO is not accountable to IURC.  Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility?  If we agree with that statement, are they subject to any IURC oversight?  Even if they are, I don't think it should be because of the ""bundled"" retail load issue, but rather because IURC has the right to regulate all ""public utilities"" (perhaps for safety reasons?) within its state.  But if we agree that IURC does have some authority over MISO as an Indiana Public Utility, then we may need to revise the statement below.

I did not go into the issue of whether there will be any ""bundled retail load"" in Indiana once MISO is operating.  In a prior order, FERC says that all transmission must be under the MISO tariff.  If this is the case, one could argue that the service is no longer ""bundled"" but I don't think we want to get into that argument with these guys.  

Here is some language that I put together.  What does everyone else think?


The MISO is a FERC jurisdictional entity that will provide interstate transmission service throughout its region.  MISO will not serve retail load, nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers.  Therefore, we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC.  

Responsibility for serving retail customers will remain with the individual entities who are currently responsible for serving those customers.  They will contract for transmission service with the MISO and will have the obligation to serve their retail customers.  It will be these load serving entities who are accountable to the IURC, not MISO.

I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a ""public interest"" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and ""load up"" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific ""Christmas tree ornaments.""

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a ""rubber stamp"" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

"FW: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules","During the merger, transactions between a regulated company of one of the partners (IP / PGE) should not do business with the other.  
 
If EES or EPMI is buying or selling from IP, please let me know.  Also, if we are delivering to retail load behind the IP market, we may need to make sure that our actions are with the code of conduct.  I don't think that we have to worry much with PGE side because EPMI and EES are already acting within the code of conduct.

Subject: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules



I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

They did not decide anything on the last conference call after I told them why Enron retail in the East likes the Duquense type imbalance (no bandwidth, thus no penalties-- imbalances settle at verifiable system lambda).  John Malowney of EPMI west desk likes the bandwidth, but we are discussing it further since it has created problems for the East EES desk (due to the penalties associated with being outside the bandwidth).  John likes the PGE proposal to settle at an index price, but PGE is reconsidering that aspect.  

Unfortunately, I don't know of any TPs that allow a bandwidth without penalties.

RE: EPSA Leave-Behind on Market-Based Rate Authority
      ?Conference Call on Friday, October 26th at 11:00 a.m.
      (EDT)

On September 14th, EPSA held a meeting at our office to discuss possible changes in the Commission's approach to granting market-based rate authority.  On October 2nd, the Commission staff released a white paper on market-based rate issues.  The Commission has also discussed the issue at recent meetings, but it was struck from the last Commission agenda and is not listed on the agenda for the October 24th Commission meeting.

Based on our conversations, attached is a draft leave-behind addressing market-based rate authorization and FERC's recently released staff report outlining several alternatives to the currently used hub-and-spoke method.  The draft puts the issue of market-based rate authority into the bigger context of both the Commission's goals of creating workably competitive markets and the array of tools available to deal with market power abuses.  We criticize the proposed supply margin assessment approach, but are less clear on what alternative we would prefer if hub-and-spoke is no longer viable.

We have scheduled a conference call on Friday, October 26th at 11:00 a.m. (EDT) to discuss the draft leave-behind and our strategy for moving forward on this issue.  We have to very clear on what message we want to leave with the Commissioners and FERC staff.  Are we recommending a less rigorous test for market-based rate authority with market mitigation and intervention after the fact?  Under what circumstances is market mitigation appropriate and how should it be done?  If the hub-and-spoke methodology is flawed, is it worth leaving it in place to get maximum market entry?  Are there alternative tests that better meet the Commission (and our) goals?

If you have any questions or comments before the call, please contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or eperrigo@epsa.org.

Importance:	High

To All,

Attached is a clean version of the comments to be filed with FERC today (8/20) relating to the WSCC-wide price mitigation.  

Highlights:

EPMI requests that the caps be removed, using arguments that caps are not beneficial to development of a robust market in the west.
If - a cap is necessary we suggest an alternative where the highest cost unit in the entire west set the price.
Price certainty - we explain how the market needs price certainty and that the price cap with the potential for changing hourly is detrimental to a functioning energy market
We point out the lack of independence of the CAISO and their board.  The fact that the ISO operates with the vested interest of CA and not the entire west.
Marketer cost recovery - we describe the current problem where marketers are excluded from ""above-the-cap"" bidding and justification. 

FYI, our comments line-up closely with those being filed by PGE and other PNW entities, so the Commission will be getting a consistent message from many WSCC entities - remove the cap.

I have briefed Tim on the content of the filing and Ray has spoken to Kim Curry of Bracewell/Patterson and approved this be filed on our behalf today 8/20.

Any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.

No, my concern was more of an organization like ""NERC"" imposing financial penalties on a grid user.  I thought our postion was that an RTO through its tariff rules or FERC could impose any penalties, but not a reliability organization.

I do have a concern from the standpoint that users are ultimately at the scheduling mercy of the operator.  The operator can cut our schedule.  Perhaps this is referencing something like reserves, where a user/load serving entity may have gone under the reserves and it gets some penalty?

Attached are: (1) highlights summary; (2) section-by-section summary; and (3) almost 150 pages of leg text (PDF doc) on Chairman Barton's draft electricity restructuring bill.  The RTO and bundled/unbundled sections will be provided ""soon"" (they day) (I am meeting with Mr. Barton's staff in a half hour), but there are ""voluntary RTO"" provisions in the incentive pricing section since they lifted that language from Burr-Sawyer legislation.  Mr. Barton has publicly said his addedum will mandate RTO participation at some point; I should know more after the meeting.  The draft below addresses a variety of issues, including TVA, BPA, etc., among others, that we also care about.  There is a retail consumer aggregation feature toward the end.  If you could look at the summary and section-by-section and let me know particular areas of interest/concern for further review that would be helpful.  Barton is taking comments through this week and next week.

"RE: Lunch with Gail McDonald (MD PSC)","Great news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  

On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to ""find"" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??

Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?

Subject:	Lunch with Gail McDonald (MD PSC)

Linda Robertson and I had lunch with Gail McDonald, Maryland PSC commissioner, yesterday in Baltimore.  Linda knows Gail and her husband (it's an old Oklahoma thing), so Linda arranged the lunch for us.

On the RTO front, Gail told us that the MD PSC is not opposed to one Northeast RTO.  They see it as inevitable but they do have concerns about the ""contamination"" problem (i.e., PJM is a good, functioning ISO, New York is not, and Maryland does not want PJM to be contaminated by New York).  They were particularly troubled by FERC's statements that ""best practices"" from New York and New England should be included in the new Northeast RTO.

I told Gail that we are very aligned with their position.  I said we believe PJM is the best market in the U.S. and the ISO is a sound, independent organization.  I said our traders like the liquidity of the western hub, and our goal has been to spread PJM throughout the rest of the Northeast.  I told her that we too are concerned about contamination from New York, which is why we worked so hard to endorse a plan that put PJM firmly in control of the development of the new RTO market design and of the new RTO.  We discussed how New York and New England are opposed to weighting the board towards PJM, but that we believe (and presumably Maryland would support this position) that the new board must be weighted by PJM board members to ensure proper implementation of the PJM model.  At a minimum, PJM must be in charge of implementing the new market design.

Gail also said the MD PSC thought the seams process should be worked out before a single RTO is in place.  I explained to her the problems of the MOU and that we (and most market participants) do not believe that the three ISOs will ever be able to work out the seams issues as long as they remain separate entities.  She was not familiar with the MOU process but seemed to agree that if the seams were not resolved by the entities over the last two years, that it is unlikely that they will ever been resolved.

Gail is going to NARUC next week (she's on the gas committee, which Nora asked her to be on earlier this year), and we urged Gail to find Nora and discuss these issues in more detail.  We told Gail that Nora (coming from the Pennsylvania PSC) understands and agrees with the concerns raised by Gail, but that Nora seems to believe that the way to fix the problem is to implement PJM throughout the Northeast.

Gail also asked about the State/FERC initiative and asked what happened with the Regional Reliability Organization concept.  I told her I will look in to it and get back to her.

As we were finishing lunch, Gail said our discussion was very helpful for her to better understand the issues surrounding a Northeast RTO.  She also said she will try and ""turn down the rhetoric"" from the PSC.  Linda and I again encouraged Gail to talk with Nora next week, and we said we hoped that we (Enron) could work together with the PSC to ensure that the right RTO is implemented in the Northeast.

Linda and I were quite pleased with the lunch and are hopeful that we can get something going with Maryland.  Ending Maryland's opposition to a Northeast RTO would be extremely helpful in the political debate that seems to be taking place.

Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

Thanks Jim!

I will talk with EWS.  Last time I did they were indifferent between Cinergy and ComEd and because of the uncertainty, I thought it better not to commit to something until we get closer to the date and we have a better idea of what we want - also because what we want may change.  It's more important at this point just to get the concept in front of the ICC.

You are right on the parking, but in the event that when customers are off PPO and there is no monthly public index, I wanted to make absolutely sure we had an out.

Good question.  Harvill said that if we wait for a good functioning wholesale market it will take 25 years and they were not going to do that.  I n the meeting I stated that the ICC should put more pressure on COmEd to fix the problems with the RTO, but I emphasized the imbalance issue.  I agree that I could clarify the letter to say fix the imbalance problems and that would be perhaps an acceptable compromise to fixing the whole RTO.  That would let us physically deliver.

Janine --

Good job.

On the hourly market price index, until we have LMP dispatch, the best we can do is a public index.  Let's not ask for too much.  Just something we can hedge against.  Can you talk with the EWS folks for the best index option???

Also, if the default is a monthly public index, why do the customer's need any ""parking""?  They can move directly to the new option.

What is your definition of ""functioning wholesale market""?  Are we stating that unless an RTO is running, we can't get rid of the PPO?  Maybe just resolve the Imbalance issue.  More specifics would be helpful.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	ICC Meeting

The ICC Energy Committee held a meeting to discuss ComEd's proposal to drop the PPO.  We argued that this should not be allowed until the wholesale market/delivery issues are dealt with because otherwise customers will have no choice but to return to ComEd at the higher bundled rate.  The good news is that a rather lengthy discussion on this issue ensued as a result.  The industrial customer group and Mid American Energy supported our views; however AES New Energy said that this was not a problem for them.

We also commented that once the PPO goes away it should not be resurrected due to the uncertainty it would create in the market.  ComEd responded that under the statute they can not offer to waive the PPO but could negotiate an arrangement on the CTC if approached by the customer.  This would mean that we could negotiate on behalf of all our customers regarding the CTC.  

We have the opportunity to file comments to the Commissioners before the actual filing.  A draft is attached. 

 << File: Commissioner Terry Harvill.doc >> 

If you have any comments, please respond by the end of the week.

Subject: RE: FERC Looking at ERCOT


Here are a couple of clarifying points:
 

The congestion charges that have been incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge.  If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upong the ERCOT protocols.  The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM.  Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation. 
When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model.  This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge.  The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned.  The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit. 
It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice.  The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially, but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion.

Thane --

Based on Wood's statements while at the PUCT, what issues will most likely drive his choice of a congestion management model?  My understanding is that Shumel Oren is on the panel at FERC, has he said anything recently that would argue that ERCOT may not be effective?  
 
Finally, what are the minor changes to the ERCOT protocols to overcome the current obstacles so that if adopted we could use across the country?

Pat Profeta of Northridge Assoc. (Entergy's congestion management consultants) told me this too and said that Michael Schnitzer of Northridge has been asked to be on the congestion management panel for RTO week.  Michael is a strong advocate of the ""SPP cornerstones"" that are largely the basis of the ""LMP/financial congestion hedge"" model (initial model!) advocated in the SE RTO mediation report.  They are going to contact Thane to get more information about ERCOT -- they recognize that ERCOT has some problems.

Agreed.  In fact, my understanding is that the ERCOT protocols state that if congestion is greater than $20 MM / year the model would change.  The market has reached $100 MM.

This is just a rumor we're hearing, but we heard that FERC wants someone who knows ERCOT congestion management on the congestion management panel for RTO Week  because FERC (presumably Pat Wood) wants to use the ERCOT congestion management system as the standard CMS throughout the country.  From what I know about ERCOT (which isn't much and I have a call in to Thane to get an update), this wouldn't be a good thing for us.  We'll keep you posted.

Subject:	EES assistance

I met with Rogers, Dale, Narsimha, and Berney earlier this week to determine how to ensure that EES is getting timely information on FERC filings that may impact the EES regulated positions.  They asked that Govt Affairs provide them with the basic information on FERC filings (filing date, protest date and brief description of the proposed tariff change), especially for changes that impact rates, retail standards, imbalances, non-negotiable agreements, and icap.  

In order to facilitate this, Susan Lindberg will email FERC filing notices to Rogers, Dale, Narsimha, Berney and Don (with copies to the state GA person, such as Janine in the Midwest, and with a copy to Harry).  Dale said that his group should be able to actually make the analysis of the filing and determine if EES should protest/comment/intervene.  Dale will send us a copy of EES top 40 priority companies to watch.  Govt Affairs folks should also watch for non-FERC filings that may impact this list, as well.

Also, EES is doing physical delivery in ComEd, ERCOT, Cinergy, Columbus Southern (AEP), California, Nevada, NY, PJM, and NEPOOL, so we need to make sure that they have notice of tariff changes and other issues in these regions.  Thanks.

We should intervene based on our potential interest in serving customers pursuant to AB661(short answer=Paul's language).  It is possible that we may want to reduce revenue requirements by recommending the use of financial products to minimize utility revenue risk. We have intervened in the AB 661 regulation proceeding as Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

We have intervened in certain cases where we may have an ongoing

direct access.  We also can intervene on behalf of EWS who may provide
risk mgt. products to reduce utility rates (i.e., weather derivitives to

Subject:	Update:  Meeting w/Edison RE: recovery of Negative CTC Claim

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, ""Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California.""

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: ""Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation.""

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

We are having a conference call tomorrow with PGE.  They did not decide anything on the last conference call after I told them why Enron retail in the East likes the Duquense type imbalance (no bandwidth, thus no penalties-- imbalances settle at verifiable system lambda).  John Malowney of EPMI west desk likes the bandwidth, but we are discussing it further since it has created problems for the East EES desk (due to the penalties associated with being outside the bandwidth).  John likes the PGE proposal to settle at an index price, but PGE is reconsidering that aspect.  

Unfortunately, I don't know of any TPs that allow a bandwidth without penalties. 

Let me know if you want to participate in the call.

Subject: DOE Meeting Dec 7th



Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA members in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a wholesale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri.

Hey Jim,
Thanks for the phone call.  Do you know Aldie Warnock?  He is kind of like
our political whip over here.
Subsequent to this email below, he told me that he was looking for someone
who could serve as a regulatory/FERC advisor to the trade floor - right up
your alley.  He asked me if I knew anyone and I suggested you and gave your
background as an Enron big shot.  He either knew you or knew of you and
said that he wasn't interested.  I really couldn't figure it out, and I
told him I thought the world of you (that may have actually been a negative
though).  I think that he was interviewing a girl from your shop for the
position was her name Christi Nicholae (sp?).  I share this in complete
confidence with you.
So, if you are still interested in talking to us, I would like to set up
lunch with John Orr.  He is an atty who handles most of the RTOs and some
FERC stuff.  John reports to John Meyer if you know him.  He is looking for
someone, but you would be way over qualified.  But, as I suggested before
maybe he could reevaluate what kind of individual he is looking for given
your qualifications.
Let me know what you want to do.

Hi Jim -
I sent Mari an email at home about a position that came up here.  We just
had a guy in our regulatory group leave - his position is much below
anything that you would consider, but given the vacancy, they may be able
to create a higher level position for you.  At this point I am really just
seeing if you would even consider talking to our folks and I haven't
presented it to anyone over here either.  Just thought I would bring it up
considering the situation over there.  If you have some interest maybe we
could set up lunch sometime soon.
By the way congrats on the baby.  Maybe it will be a boy this time.

Rick/Jim/Sue--one of the things we need to talk about in a general context is how we are going to address the Enron swipes in these types of forums.  I imagine they are going to continue for many months to come and my initial thought is to make sure that we have Enron people at as many forums and conferences as there are out there and not shy away from public visibility. I'm not sure how I feel about whether we should be trying to get spots on the panels and whether if we do that, it should be a high level person like a Rick or a Jim.

Subject:	NARUC Day 1

Monday's NARUC convention consisted of three sessions, 1)opening remarks; 2) FERC RTO Policy Update; and 3) a session on attracting capital to the energy infrastructure. 

1)	Opening Remarks - The convention opened with remarks by NARUC President William Nugent, FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell, PA PUC Chairman Glenn Thomas (substituting for former Governor Ridge), and the featured speaker Comcast Cable President Brian Roberts.  
a.	Nugent rambled on about how this is an interesting period we are in and how regulators are being challenges and didn't much of anything.
b.	Brownell introduced a Georgia Commissioner named Bubba who sang several patriotic songs (she did not address anything relative to FERC policy or activity)
c.	Thomas spoke about the great state of PA, Benjamin Franklin, William Penn, and Philadelphia and also did not address anything related to policy
d.	Roberts talked about the future of cable television.
2)	The FERC Policy Update - this panel consisted of moderator Nugent, FERC Staff Dan Larcamp, Southern Company Chairman Allen Franklin, James Torgenson of DPL, and PA Commissioner Terence Fitzpatrick.  
a.	Larcamp and did not provide very much information or in-site into FERC RTO policy.  He did say that they are looking at compatible market rules and protocols across all the RTO's (what he didn't say was that they would be the same rules and protocols).  He said that they are looking at 3 RTO's at least,  In the Midwest the Alliance is moving forward and MISO is getting bigger with the addition of SPP and that FERC is looking at if the Midwest RTO should be 1 or 2 RTO's; in the Northeast they are looking to resolve the governance and market views issues and that all views must be considered (I took this to mean that on governance they are going to go three/three/three from each ISO, but others I talked with outside the session didn't get that - time will tell); and the Southeast will be slower to develop, there are small but clear regional differences that are important, and that it must accommodate the for-profits and the not-for-profits (public power).
b.	Franklin from Southern said that the state commissioners are ultimately held accountable for RTO's (interesting comment) and there are two major issues to be considered in forming RTO's - cost and reliability and that neither can be taken for granted.  He promoted variable electric transmission pricing similar to natural gas transportation rates and not postage stamp rates (he used the example that in his service territory natural gas is located in the southeast part of the territory while load is centered in the north, but since there is a single electrical transmission rate generation is built close to the natural gas source to avoid the variable gas transmission rate).  He promoted the SETRANS model to accommodate the many public power entities in the south.
c.	Torgenson of DPL gave a very dry overview of the status of MISO with nothing new to report.
d.	Fitzpatrick of PA (one of the Commissioners Steffes, Montovano, and I met with in July) began by stating the PA Commission is fully supportive of the NERTO (must have been our July meeting) for two reasons i) advantages of a bigger market, and ii) FERC's clear preference for PJM as the platform.  He mentioned the concern of commissions in other PJM states but, in general there is support.  He then went on to stress the merits of DSM.
3)	The last session on infrastructure capital was the most entertaining from an Enron perspective (we have quickly  become the fodder for case studies and Enron is now a verb that is more akin to a four-letter verb.  The panel consisted of moderator Iowa Commissioner Diane Munns, Charles Cicchetti of Pacific Economic Group, Jeff Miller of J.P. Morgan Partners, Christine Uspenski of Schwab Capital Markets, and Walter Rogers of Merrill Lynch Asset Management.
a.	Cicchetti said that wholesale deregulation has made state regulators' job harder and that they must be market participants (he used the term GONZO market participants).  He also thinks that if transmission planning and expansion is left to the RTO's, no one will build transmission (no reason given) and that regulators need to be involved.
b.	Rogers' (of Merrill Lynch) most notable comments came as an answer to a question when he stated there are three major issues that are affecting infrastructure investment transactions - California, the downturn in the economy, and ENRON.
c.	Uspenski from Schwab told the regulators ""Don't get Enron'd"".  That if something presented to you doesn't seem to make sense then it doesn't and they should investigate further.
d.	Miller from JP Morgan also mentioned Enron several times in the same context as the others.

Signed,
Hoatson, Robinson, Staines, Connor

RTO Week at FERC Leads to Lifting of December Deadline



Nov. 11 (California Energy Markets)

Following up on a week-long series of workshops it called
""RTO Week,"" the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
issued an order on November 7 to clarify its expectations
for the development of regional transmission organizations
throughout the country [RM01-12]. In addition to
acknowledging the comments it received at the workshops
during the week of October 15-19, it seemed clear from the
order that the federal commissioners heard loud and clear
the message being conveyed at FERC's Western regional
infrastructure workshop held last week in Seattle--""don't
fence us in.""

The FERC order tactfully backpedaled from the commission's
recent assertions that it would like to see four regional
RTOs in the country and made particular, though veiled,
reference to Western parties' objections to a regionwide
RTO: ""In the West, it is now apparent that the presence of
three sub-regional organizations (bound by a workable
seams agreement) under a larger umbrella organization has
the potential to succeed.""

With this statement, FERC left open the likelihood that
the California Independent System Operator, WestConnect
(the successor to Desert Star) and RTO West in the
Northwest would continue to have operational jurisdiction
for transmission services in their respective regions.

FERC also clarified that it intends to proceed in
developing RTOs on two parallel tracks. In the pending RTO
dockets already filed at FERC, it will resolve the
geographic scope and governance issues of the RTOs. In the
docket in which this order was issued, the commission will
take up the thorny issues of transmission tariff and
market-design rulemaking. The commission also recognized
that market activities need not all fall under the rubric
of a stand-alone RTO. For instance, it stated, the Midwest
ISO, Alliance and the Southwest Power Pool have proposed
forming one market-monitoring unit.

The order paid special attention to inviting the
participation of state regulators in developing viable RTO
structures. FERC will be creating state-federal RTO panels
and will seek their advice on the makeup of regional
markets. FERC said it will also be meeting with investors
in order to better understand financing of transmission
projects as well as independent transmission companies.
The commission reiterated its support of both for-profit
transcos and nonprofit ISOs and ""any reasonable
combination of the two.""

FERC gave itself and those responsible for developing
workable transmission organizations some breathing room as
well. Recognizing that RTO development was at various
stages throughout the country, it backed off from the
December 15 operational deadline established in Order No.
2000. Rather, the commission will establish timelines
addressing the development of RTOs in each general region
in future orders [Shauna O'Donnell].

Carin attended today's CFA press conference in which Mark Cooper released an electricity report.  Below is Carin's very helpful and well done summary of the report together with links to the CFA press release and the full report.  While we will sharply disagree with their comments on restructuring results in the states, we should be able to make use of their latest comments on the critical need to separate transmission from generation to avoid discrimination.  We should recruit them for our RTO legislative coalition.

The risk of asking for this is:  What if we don't get an affirmative vote??

Members of UBP-RSB,

The attached documents represent the basis of organizational design
development for a Retail Standards Board per the original charge of this
organization.  The versions of the documents attached here reflect the
changes identified in discussions during our Baltimore meeting on July 23rd.
Your Governance Committee needs you to confirm that these documents now
state our intentions and the design needs of a Retail Standards Board before
we can reasonably proceed with detail organizational design efforts.

As the Governance Committee's work proceeds, the organizational design may
evolve slightly as the high level view of these documents does not contain
every design requirement or anticipate every contingency.  There may be
issues that arise in developing an inclusive organization that need your
further attention.  As, or if, such issues arise, the GC will seek your
input.

For now, please provide an email response which indicates either that

a)  your company agrees with and supports the Statement of Structure and the
membership's revisions to Strawman 2 as described in the attached documents,


     or

b)  your company cannot support the Statement of Structure and the
membership's revisions to Strawman 2 as described in the attached documents.

Please provide your response no later than August 31, 2001.

"AEP & Texas Retail Competition","Guys --

We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  

AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).

Jean was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.

Calvin,  per our discussion,  at the time we returned our commercial customers to utility service earlier this year,  all accounts had accrued credit balances.  PG&E transferred these credits off each account as they were setting them up for utility billing.

These same accounts are now being returned to direct access.  We began receiving the first DA bills from PG&E earlier this month, all with zero beginning balances.  Enron expects that all credit balances will be reinstated on the respective accounts before the next billing cycle.  

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this request.   Page me if you need to.  888.740.8480.

Gentlemen,
 
At the ESC meeting last week, some discussion was brought forth about the voting model and bylaws of the ESC.  I joined a small task group to investigate various structures and such.
 
I have attached a strawman set of Bylaws for the ESC that I have written.  I would like to get your input on these items as soon as possible.  The small focus group will be working to determine an appropriate model, and will be using the NERC 8-sector model as its starting point.  I would like to propose this 5-sector model instead, as I think it more closely aligns with the way business works and builds the approriate motivational structure.  There may need to be more detail in the sector definitions, as right now they are somewhat loose.
 
Thanks in advance for your comments.
 

Andy

"RE: Direct Access","Thanks for the info.  While there may be some differences in presentation, there don't appear to be any basic differences in the analysis.  All of the discussions of the legislation need to be aware that the passage is highly uncertain.

I agree with the analysis that if you have never been DA and sign up today there is a very large possibility that you will pay a surcharge (assuming the legislation passes).  

Let me know if there is anything else.

All:
A lot of runors are swirling around.  There is legislation pending right
now as I write this e-mail.  The outcome is uncertain.  But here is what I
know and what I have been working on for BOMA.
First, the CPUC continues to threaten that it will suspend DA on September
6th, including any DA contract signed since last January.  The PUC has
threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending
action on the issue by the legislature.  Even if the PUC were to act, the
legislature could override their action with a statute.  But I anticipate
that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering
the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September
14th.
The real action is in the legislature.  There is a comprehensive bill -- SB
78XX, the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison.
For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen, the Governor and the
Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison.  Here
are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it:

1) The state would securitize $2.9 billion in bonds to help SCE pay its
debts.  Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use 20kW or
more in peak daily demand.  That would translate to about 0.06 (as in
6/100ths) of a penny per kW.  The original proposal was to place the
bailout burden only on SCE customers who use 500kW peak demand, which would
have been maybe 1.5 cents per kW (since the base would have been much
smaller), but  we beat that back to the current proposal of 20kW.

2) The Edison surcharge would be non-bypassable.  That means that Edison
customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or
from a DA contractor.  If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the
Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying!

3) The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand (load) which
exceeds supply as calculated as follows: DWR contracts + IOU retained
generation + IOU long term contracts.  If this delta, or headroom exists as
of 1/1/03, then, per PUC regs,which are yet to be devloped, the Calif.
Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount
of headroom, without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee.  (An
exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a
customer for the customer's proportional share of the state's stranded
costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR, but for which there
is no market.)  If no headroom exists, a customer still could go DA, but
pay the exit fee to do so.

4) A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended.
Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to
1/17/01 to continue without penalty.  It looks like contracts signed
between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty,
but that date is not definite.  Contracts signed between June and August
24th would also be permitted, but may have to pay some sort of retroactive
exit fee, on a sliding scale, depending on the date they were signed.  All
DA contracts after August 24th would be subject to the 1/1/03 schedule
described in #3 above.

In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers, and exit fees for
DA customers when no headroom exists, there will be another surcharge for
all non-municipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since
January 17th.  That surcharge would be to payoff $13 billiion in state
revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR
bought since January.

Where does BOMA, and the rest of the business community stand on these
issues?

1) BOMA has been O.K. with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric
customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan. 17,
when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market
power.

2) While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR
long term contracts, we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for
them, and wants to be held harmless for their costs.  BOMA and other
business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated
or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without
exit fees.

3) BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any
surplus electricity revenues after the first $500 million to ratepayers
based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate
payments.  This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on
customers who have experienced rate increases greater than 50% in the last
few months.

4) Finally, BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison.  But the
Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone
he can see, including all business groups, to help get it enacted.  In that
light, BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers, residential as well
as business pay the debt.  The legislature, however, did not want to pass
this cost on to residential customers, so then it became a fight over where
the consumer threshold would be.  As stated above, we have suceeded in
getting it as low as 20kW peak demand.  (NOTE:  There are those that feel
it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to
get the state out of the energy business.  You can decide for yourselves.)

5) It should also be noted that the Edison, bond and DWR surcharges may all
be covered in the existing rates you are now paying.  That is to say that
there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since
the market price for power has come down substantially.  But this remains
to be seen.

There is more to this package and moer to come i9n terms of changes.  The
committee is going back in at 6:30 this evening and we will see what
happens.  I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation.

Les Spahnn

I'm going to Carson City tomorrow.  I thought I could present the following message to the Commissioners:    

Contracts were negotiated in a bilateral market at arm's length.  Nobody was requiring NPCo to do business with us.  Similar contracts were upheld by the ALJ in the PNW refunds case.  You're going to completely screw up forward markets and NPCo's ability to contract in the future.  Think of the risk premium that will attach to future contracts.  
We tried to be the good guy with NPCo by offering a more comprehensive solution for them numerous times.  Now we're getting attacked for their mistakes?
We have met with NPCo a number of times to try and resolve this issue.  But the resolution requires that they post collateral.  Now they won't even talk with us.  The only way you (PUCN) are going to fix this is if you step up and require the utilities to post collateral when necessary. 
 
However, after talking with Steve Hall I concluded that it would be unwise at this point for me to contact the Commissioners.  We don't have anything to offer and very little new to say.   For example, according to Steve, we won't touch a blend and extend because of credit problems.  This said, he was uncomfortable saying that the entire issue was collateral.

We are having a conference call tomorrow with PGE.  They did not decide anything on the last conference call after I told them why Enron retail in the East likes the Duquense type imbalance (no bandwidth, thus no penalties-- imbalances settle at verifiable system lambda).  John Malowney of EPMI west desk likes the bandwidth, but we are discussing it further since it has created problems for the East EES desk (due to the penalties associated with being outside the bandwidth).  John likes the PGE proposal to settle at an index price, but PGE is reconsidering that aspect.  

Unfortunately, I don't know of any TPs that allow a bandwidth without penalties. 

Let me know if you want to participate in the call.

There does appear to be some intelligence gathering going on at the CPUC.  You should speak with legal about the inquiry.

Jim, et al,

Interesting e-mail from UC.  Apparently the PUC is implying to UC that DASRs
submitted after July 1 need to be associated with a contract executed prior
to July 1.  Is this consistent with our intell?  Can they make these
inquiries?  Please advise.

RE: Docket EL01-68-000  Investigation of Wholesale Rates of Public Utility Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Services in the Western Systems Coordinating Council.
 
Dear Mr. Boergers: 
 
Enron Power Marketing Inc. (EPMI) respectfully requests the opportunity to make a statement during the October 29, 2001 technical conference in the above-referenced proceeding.  EPMI would appreciate the opportunity to allow the following representative to make a statement on its behalf:

G. Alan Comnes, 
Director, Government Affairs 
Enron Corp. 
121 SW Salmon Street 
Portland, OR 97204 
email: AComnes@enron.com 
telephone: 503-464-8129 

EPMI operates as a marketer of electric power and natural gas in markets throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC).  EPMI has been an active participant in this and related dockets and has submitted written comments pertaining to Westwide price mitigation on both May 7, 2001and August 20, 2001. In addition to identifying problems created by continued price mitigation in the WSCC, EPMI will identify problems that will be created if the Commission were to inconsistently apply price mitigation in the WSCC or make rule changes that create further uncertainty in the marketplace.   Because of EPMI's unique position as a power marketer that operates throughout the WSCC, it has a unique perspective to provide the Commission and workshop participants.

A letter making the same request, along with Mr. Comnes' credentials, will be filed with the Commission tomorrow.  If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact me at 713-853-3180.  

Sincerely, 

Robert J. Frank

Subject:	Network Plus Service

Jim and Christi:

Here is language I proposed to EPSA to be included in ""Standardized Tariffs:""

FERC must eliminate the distinction between network and point to point transmission service and create a new ""Network Plus"" service that is the only firm transmission service offered and is available to all transmission customers.

Julie questions if this is what we really want (we being all of EPSA, including the generators).  Julie is nervous about proposing to eliminate point to point service all together.  She thinks the problem with network is that utilities are preventing generators from getting the service.  I told her that is not our issue, and just changing the rules so that network service is available to generators does not help us.  

Julie suggested language that said something like ""FERC should explore new transmission services for customers.""  I told her that doesn't work -- we need to address this issue head on.  She is concerned that we're going to have dissention within the membership.

How would you all feel about retaining point to point service but making network available to everyone, with a much less restrictive sign up period (e.g. 1 month term rather than 1 year term), etc.  I think its cleaner to eliminate the two types of services and create a new ""Network Plus"" service that's available to everyone -- that would be the ""firm"" service and ""nonfirm"" would continue to exist.  Do you all think we would want to retain point to point service?  Even if we don't, if some EPSA members want to retain point to point service, we may need to think of ways to make network more user-friendly without eliminating point to point.

Let me know what you think

"RE: Draft of Joint Comments on Standard Market Design","I would probably not sign on directly, but would support the document with the additional thoughts --

1.	I don't understand a 6 month collaborative to work through SMD - this only extends the implementation.
2.	Need to push harder on doing away with the Reserve obligation.
3.	I would argue that the RTO need not run a Day Ahead market.  Also, why does a Day Ahead market provide ""sufficient capacity committed in the right places for the next day in order to supply load reliably""?  California has a DA market and people simply did not participate.  The argument that a DA market replaces a Unit Committment process doesn't seem complete?
4.	The position and implications on CM and RT market going in at the same time needs to be made more clear - does this mean that Enron supports delaying all RTO ""activity"" (e.g., OASIS, single tariff, rates) until CM is complete?
5.	What is a ""point-to-point"" financial hedge?  Does this imply node-to-node?  Can we include some discussion of market ""hubs""?  How could I obtain a hub-to-node hedge?  Also, what about the allocation or auction process for FTRs?  How should existing transmission arrangements be managed?
6.	Do we agree to Incremental pricing vs. Rolled-In?  Will this cause any heartburn for ETS?  What about the cost of expansion to meet the needs of incremental generation?  Should this be borne by the system or the generator?

My thought is that this is a big piece and Enron should probably file its own comments rather than sign on.  Sarah Novosel is working on Enron comments.

All:

After I sent out the draft late yesterday afternoon, I found out that FERC
had extended the deadline from November 5 to ""as soon as reasonably
possible.""  Obviously, we would like to provide everyone with sufficient
time to review the draft and get approvals.  We also have a saying in
Chicago - ""Vote early and often"" and at least with respect to the ""vote
early"" we think it is important to get comments in early.

Therefore we now suggest that instead of replying by the end of today as to
whether you can sign or not sign and what must be added or deleted for you
to join, we suggest responding by the end of Friday.  This will allow us to
circulate another draft and get comments in by the middle of next week and
have considerable influence on the process.

Thanks for your help under these changing circumstances.

Jim, please see me about this issue.  As you can see, Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our 200,000 MMBtu/day of Block 2 capacity on El Paso.  In fact, I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March, even before we signed up for the capacity.  You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list.  I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far.

The CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies.  Their concern is not the same as PG&E's.  And to the extent anything is agreed to, reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms, and I don't think we want to go there.  We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PG&E and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived.

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says ""and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.""  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the ""traditional rate making"" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out.

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

Subject:	EPSA conference call re. Reporting Requirements NOPR

Today's EPSA conference call was well-attended and the participants seemed to agree that the status quo (i.e., making relatively limited paper filings of transactional information) is much preferable to the more extensive electronic posting that FERC is proposing.  Admittedly, though, some of what FERC is proposing seems to be justified -- for example, the FPA requires every public utility to show rates and charges in the form prescribed by the Commission, which gives the Commission a lot of latitude.  

The basic conclusion was that EPSA's filing should make the point that FERC should be able to find a way to meet its Section 205-c obligations in a way that is not potentially commercially damaging to market participants.  Also, FERC may be overreaching in requesting data that does not pertain to physical transactions.  Additionally, there was some discussion of requesting confidential treatment of the information to be posted.  EPSA will draft comments with the assistance of outside counsel, Dickstein Shapiro.  A draft will be circulated and if any of you are not on the EPSA distribution list I will make sure you get a copy.

Elizabeth and others, we have already discussed the importance of Enron weighing in separately in this proceeding.  Since comments are due October 5, I believe at this point it would be prudent to call our outside counsel so that we can begin the drafting process.

On October 17, 2001, Dynegy Midwest Generation, Inc. and Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. (Dynegy)
tendered for filing a Complaint against Commonwealth Edison Company.  In its complaint, Dynegy alleges 
that ComEd has failed to properly enforce the network resource designation provisions of its Open 
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT).  Dynegy further alleges that ComEd's actions jeopardize reliability, 
deprive Dynegy of revenues for capacity sales, and permits the improper prioritization of network transmission 
service for bumping and curtailment. Interventions are due October 26.

The filing is required since this is an EWG with cost-based rate authority.  The requirement extends even to indirect transfers of ownership such as this one.

Are we sure that this is required in the context of (i) a transfer of the stock in Doyle owned by Powergen Investco LLC, which represents 50% of the equity interest in Doyle, or (ii) an upstream transfer of 100% of the stock in Powergen to Walton EMC?

Since this is a transfer of jurisdictional assets, the filing required is pursuant to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and Part 33 of the Commission's regulations. Part 33 lists information to be provided and it is fairly extensive.  In order to show that the transaction is in the public interest, the Commission requires that you provide a description of each applicant's business activities, ownership, affiliates and subsidiaries (with a description of their business activities), a list of wholesale power sales customers of the applicants, and of course a description of the transaction.  We made a similar filing recently for the New Albany sale.  

There may also have to be a Section 205 filing made if any tariff revisions are required. This is usually a pretty quick filing to prepare.  In the case of the New Albany sale, some minor changes had to be made to the affiliate portion of the tariff sheets.

For the New Albany sale, we used LeBoeuf, Lamb as our counsel.  (Christi -- is this typical, or do we sometimes use Bracewell instead?  In any event, if closing is imminent it sounds as if we need to proceed very quickly.  Please call to discuss.)

Yes. this requires regulatory approval.  It would be a filing that has a 21 day notice period.  It typically requires 45 - 60 days for approval, but we could ask for expedited approval.  I would recommend hiring Andrea Settanni at B&P to make the filing.  She said it would be less than $5000.  I think that on the past sales, either ENA legal or the commercial group hires the outside counsel.  Susan Lindberg can help coordinate it.  Thanks.

	Christi,

	if we are selling our interest in Doyle I LLC to Walton EMC, does this require any regulatory approval?  Keep in mind that it will be PGI selling its interest to Walton EMC in the Doyle I LLC.  Doyle I LLC contniues to be the counterparty to the PPA.  It would seem that this should not be a reg issue but we want to make sure.

	Given that you want to close by the end of the month, has anyone checked to see what regulatory approval will be needed to transfer our 50% interest.  I suspect that we will need FERC approval as Doyle is an EWG with ""cost-based-rate"" authority.  As an aside, Dan Watkiss did the regulatory work and might be able to respond most quickly.

Last week, the NEPOOL Members Comm did not take any action against Enron. 

I received a call today (that I intend to return tomorrow) from Dave Doot - NEPOOL Secretary.  He would like to have a phone call with Enron's attorneys and credit people to figure out how to manage our credit issues going forward.  The reason there was no action last week was because NEPOOL hoped that they could work something out.  I do not know what the bills are for EES/EEMC/EPMI?

I will call Dave Doot and find a good time for later this week when I can arranage a call with the appropriate people.

Subject: Response to PA Energy Task Force recommendations


Jim:
 
Overall, I do not see any significant problems/omissions in the draft Task Force recommendations.  
 
My suggestion is to submit a specific, brief and informal response (via a letter or e-mail).  However, if desired, I could certainly draft formal, more extensive comments. 
 
Some points for your input:
 
1. The recommendations encourage the development and use of coal and nuclear power (albeit with an emphasis on clean coal technologies and safety, respectively). *Does Enron have an issue with advocating these sources among others as components of a diversified fuel strategy?
 
2.  Although the role of competition and deregulation in PA's success is acknowledged, there is some language supporting government oversight, for example ""...it cannot be assumed that deregulated markets are fully matured and can be left completely free from government oversight.  Responsible stewardship of restructuring is vital to the preservation of workable energy markets and a reliable energy supply.""  
*I don't see a problem with this, but wanted to highlight it to you.
 
3. The section on natural gas states that as prices are seasonal, consumers are exposed to market fluctuations, but there is no mention of the role of price risk management.  
*I suggest we point out that price risk management tools can play a vital role in mitigating volatility.  Perhaps we want to also send them our recent White Paper on mitigating price risk (attached for your reference). 
 
Please let me know your thoughts.
 
Jennifer

My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like ""CYA not Calif Youth Admin"" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.

Thanks Jim!

I will talk with EWS.  Last time I did they were indifferent between Cinergy and ComEd and because of the uncertainty, I thought it better not to commit to something until we get closer to the date and we have a better idea of what we want - also because what we want may change.  It's more important at this point just to get the concept in front of the ICC.

You are right on the parking, but in the event that when customers are off PPO and there is no monthly public index, I wanted to make absolutely sure we had an out.

Good question.  Harvill said that if we wait for a good functioning wholesale market it will take 25 years and they were not going to do that.  I n the meeting I stated that the ICC should put more pressure on COmEd to fix the problems with the RTO, but I emphasized the imbalance issue.  I agree that I could clarify the letter to say fix the imbalance problems and that would be perhaps an acceptable compromise to fixing the whole RTO.  That would let us physically deliver.

Good job.

On the hourly market price index, until we have LMP dispatch, the best we can do is a public index.  Let's not ask for too much.  Just something we can hedge against.  Can you talk with the EWS folks for the best index option???

Also, if the default is a monthly public index, why do the customer's need any ""parking""?  They can move directly to the new option.

What is your definition of ""functioning wholesale market""?  Are we stating that unless an RTO is running, we can't get rid of the PPO?  Maybe just resolve the Imbalance issue.  More specifics would be helpful.

Subject:	ICC Meeting

The ICC Energy Committee held a meeting to discuss ComEd's proposal to drop the PPO.  We argued that this should not be allowed until the wholesale market/delivery issues are dealt with because otherwise customers will have no choice but to return to ComEd at the higher bundled rate.  The good news is that a rather lengthy discussion on this issue ensued as a result.  The industrial customer group and Mid American Energy supported our views; however AES New Energy said that this was not a problem for them.

We also commented that once the PPO goes away it should not be resurrected due to the uncertainty it would create in the market.  ComEd responded that under the statute they can not offer to waive the PPO but could negotiate an arrangement on the CTC if approached by the customer.  This would mean that we could negotiate on behalf of all our customers regarding the CTC.  

We have the opportunity to file comments to the Commissioners before the actual filing.  A draft is attached.

I think that Enron is interested supporting your idea.  Let's weigh in with appropriate language that counters the below language -

I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   

Please work with Sarah N. to create a reasonable response and our key arguments.

Citizens Action has been going back and forth with Cinergy on the jurisdictional question and the right for the IURC to reinsert itself after approval of transfer, ie rights of review down the road.  At this point, I have stayed out of the email traffic, but we could weigh in supporting the concept that MISO is FERC jurisdictional.  See below.

Ron:

    It seems to me that the IURC cannot approve transfer of operational
control to an RTO which does not have FERC approval, but it also seems to me
that the IURC is not required to approve transfer of operational control to
an RTO which does have FERC approval.  In other words, come December 15, or
January 1, or January 15, we could have Indiana utilities still being
operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are
today.  Do you agree or disagree with that proposition?

    If my proposition is correct, then the issue becomes whether the proposed
transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section 83,
i.e. a ""public interest"" standard.

    As you know, I think that MISO has done a creditable (although by no
means perfect) job in considering and balancing the interests of affected
parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process.     So, I think that
it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and ""load up"" the IURC
approval process with a lot of party-specific ""Christmas tree ornaments.""

    By the same token, I am quite concerned about a ""rubber stamp"" approach
to IURC review.  I think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have a
significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not
exceed five.  I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its
approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects
of MISO operation on Indiana retail load.  I think that the state-level
parties (and the IURC) have an interest in defining the goals or standards
for MISO performance during the initial transfer period, based on which an
extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied.  I
think that the state-level parties (and the IURC) have an interest in the
MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of
accountability re (at least) bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission
and the Indiana parties.   And, I do not see those interests being recognized
or accommodated very much, if at all, in your settlement proposal.  Do you
disagree?  If so, tell me how you see those interests addressed in your
proposal.

    I want to hear what others say, but as matters stand my inclination would
be to pursue these issues in the hearing, brief them, and then let the
Commission decide.  Do you think that this approach would delay the IURC
decisional process enough to make a difference? If so, how much delay with
what effect?

    Thanks.

                                                        Mike

"WEEKLY UPDATE","Steve --

I will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.  Some things to be aware of --

1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE Complaint

We filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  Jeff Dasovich will call John Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  Enron is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  

2.	California Legislation

SCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor Davis is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.

Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Jennifer Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.

 

3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn Subpeona

Litigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  Mike Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.

4.	FERC Refund Case

Enron presented its ""ripple"" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see Bob Frank for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by Alan Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.

 

5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO Mediation

Both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  Sarah Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  Christi Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.

6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive

Sue Mara continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).

Steve - 

See attached  article.  The Energy Summit turned out to be quite worthwhile and well timed, as I was able to get a better perspective of what opportunities we may have to make changes next year.  Also, had a chance to chat briefly with Chairman Connelly, Commissioner Vasington and Commissioner Keating, and others. The most telling part of the article is the last paragraph where Speaker Finneran says, ""We'll be doing some adjustments"" in legislation next year, ""Some of them may be vary large adjustments, but they will be adjustments. We're trying to formulate the phase of deregulation, an enhanced deregulation, if you will.""  My sense is that competitive Default service may be a possibility, supplier consolidated billing may also require a change to the legislation. Clearly, it is a time to try to hone in on what EES and ENA's wish list is for Mass

I met with DeTore Thursday night as well, and would like to reschedule a meeting with you and him within the next couple of weeks if possible.  

Let's discuss.

Christi/Sarah--you guys are probably aware of this, but just in case you aren't, there was an article in the Minneapolis paper yesterday that Xcel (NSP) had filed on Friday with FERC to transfer it's transmission system to a new company called TransLink Transmission Co.  Joining them are Alliant, Corn Belt Coop (Iowa), Mid AMerican, NPPD, and OPPD.  

I noted that there was a quote in the article that ""Xcel estimates that it would cut its overal transmission related fees by more than a thrid through it's participation in Translink.......because there will be less overlap of functions.""

Subject: Enron Energy Services' objections to PaPUC assessment


Christie, below is the message I sent to Tom. Attached are the objections. I'll call you Tuesday morning to see where things stand on this.
____________________________________

Tom, the PaPUC has recently assessed gas marketers for the regulatory expenses for the PUC, the OCA and the OSBA. Enron Energy Services' assessment for all three is $147,277.

Unless you tell us to the contrary, we assume that you want us to file objections to the assessments. Attached are objections that we have prepared. Can you please fax us a copy of the assessment notice Enron received? We believe the assesments may have been received around 8/19-8/21.

Objections must be filed within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the assessment notice.  The 15-day objection period begins on the date the certified mail return receipt is signed.  If the 15th day falls on a weekend or a legal holiday, the last date for filing is extended to the next business day.

The statutes require the assessments to be paid within 30 days of receipt, even though objections are filed.  The payments must be made ""under protest"" in order to be refunded under the statutory procedure, which we believe is inadequate.

We are attempting to avoid the payment obligation thru a preliminary injunction request in Commonwealth Court, but we have no assurance that the court will act before the 30th day for payment.  If not, the assessment must be paid under protest.  If necessary, we will provide a cover letter for the protest payment to the PUC.

Please call me if you have any questions or comments. Thanks.

Dear Reader:

A new world is unfolding and you're in it.  The industry you know is
changing into one no one has ever seen and you'll probably be a part of it.

That's why we've created Restructuring Today -- to report to you the
twists, the plans, failures, strategies, shocks, absurdities, new sales
and buying methods as energy and communications converge into American's
biggest industry.

Add the $220 billion power industry to the $80 billion gas industry and
merge in the $200+ billion communications industry and you're
talking big bucks.  Restructuring Today is focused down the road,
reporting where the industry's headed every business day.

Our editors will tell you what the CEOs making the big decision are
thinking and planning on.  And those editors cover more seminars than
you could imagine going to (or paying for).  They're guided by a network
of correspondents in state capitals - most of them business editors of
important newspapers.

You can call 1-800-486-8201 anytime with your questions because that
keeps us up on what our readers want to know.  The news is readable
because Restructuring Today's editors write the way people talk -- not in
the language of the Federal Register.

Analysis:  Restructuring Today is not written by recent journalism
graduates.  Our editors are directed not to write what the news is but
to report what the news means.  Readers often tell us that Restructuring
Today's analysis is what they find especially useful.

Urgent:  We have enjoyed being able to send you a few copies of
Restructuring Today and if you would like to benefit from our special,
unique focus on convergence and new markets, simply fax the
completed attached order form and I'll make sure you don't miss a
single, vital issue.

Cordially,

Season Hawksley
Marketing Manager
800-486-8201

PS:  While the turmoil in California and the west has eased up, the
forward thrust continues.  Congress and the new FERC are out to

"RE: Dave's Comments ICAP","I still think that Enron should be advocating some form of Negawatt program for non-retail access states.  Using an RTP tariff that more closely tracks the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load response needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.

By the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.  We should make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week.

Subject:	RE: RTO Week Comments -- ICAP

 The FERC Staff report on RTO Week states that most panelists agree that some type of long term capacity obligation is needed, as long as demand is not very price responsive, in order to allow generation to recover its fixed costs and support investment.  

The report also notes that some panelists support:  

	-	a recent staff proposal supporting an LSE holding foward call options on energy YES, and 

	-	a capacity obligation being a transitional obligation until demand become price responsive.  As I describe below I believe that placing the responsibility on the LSE should be sufficient, I don't think you need a transistional period.

I have cut and pasted our Executive Summary from the ICAP comments as our response (see below), but I have a couple of questions for this group:

	1.	We say in our comments that a real time energy market, through an RTO, will give consumers the means to adjust their demand curve because they will see real time prices.  However, if a state has a rate freeze in effect and/or if retail access is not permitted in a state, how can retail load respond to the RTO's real time spot market prices? The short answer would be, they won't.  But we need to remember that some states still are moving forward with some type of retail access, mostly for the C&I customer market.  These are the folks who can make a difference and the ones with the most potential to benefit.  In the areas of no retail access it is still important to have a transparent market to send the correct signals for development of transmission and generation, but even without retail access and a fixed rate, depending upon new technologies and innovations some larger C&I customers may opt to build their own in-house source of energy and sell off any excess, without market signals this would not be possible.  We need to include this response in our comments.

	2.	What do we think of a proposal where LSEs hold forward call options on energy as a way to achieve a capacity requirement?  This is the proposal I believe we should support because it places the procurement for sufficient resources where it belongs, on the LSE.  The generators will still be able to receive a ""capacity"" payment (the one they like so much now from the ISOs in PJM and NY)

Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.  Also, any thoughts you have on other parts of the Staff report would be greatly appreciated (thanks Dave Perino for sending you comments).

Thanks Everyone

Sarah



EPMI opposes the continuation or implementation of installed capacity requirements.  Four appropriately sized Regional Transmission Organizations (""RTOs"") that encompass robust, competitive spot markets for energy and operating reserve products (including demand side management products) will provide an efficient and timely solution for the construction of adequate generation, the siting of appropriate transmission and efficient use of demand side management products to ensure that demand is met in real time.  Spot markets reveal the cost of procuring  (or not using) electricity based on actual supply and demand conditions and, thus, signal the need for new generation capacity.  They also ensure that consumers 'see' the cost of procurement decisions through transparent spot market processes and adjust demand based on discovered prices.  These markets will keep supply and demand in balance in both the long and short run without the use of artificial planning criteria.  Therefore, there is no need to continue separate installed capacity requirements in an RTO environment.
The use of the spot market to establish pricing for all energy products is new to the electricity industry.  Regulated consumers have historically paid utility tariffs that reflect regulatory decisions.  These regulated tariffs provide little, if any, meaningful supply/demand price information to the consumer so the response has been to consume even during times when the underlying ""cost"" of doing so has been high.  As a result, demand curves have been categorized as 'inelastic' or 'vertical' suggesting the need for 'capacity' related products to meet any unexpected price insensitive demand.  The creation of RTOs and the resulting spot markets they include will, for the first time, give consumers the means and incentive to change the shape of their demand curve as a result of direct real time pricing information.  Changes in the shape of the demand curve will in turn eliminate the need for specific capacity related payments as supply/demand interaction, and curtailment, will be based on economic choices.

ComEd seeks rate hike for biz
Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators
Crain's -- October 15, 2001
By Steve Daniels <mailto:sdaniels@crain.com>
Commonwealth Edison Co. is pressing for another big hike in its charges for
delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers.

The Chicago utility's Aug. 31 filing with federal regulators to nearly
double transmission rates - for carrying electricity over its long-haul,
high-voltage lines for these customers - has triggered opposition from state
regulators.

That request followed a June proposal for a 37% increase in distribution
charges, for moving power through the utility's more local, lower-voltage
wires (Crain's, June 11). That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois
Commerce Commission (ICC).

If approved, the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and
distribution costs by about 50% for business customers that leave the
utility for competing power suppliers.

Perhaps more important, the new rates would clear the way for delivery
charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicago-area power users in
three years, when a freeze on ComEd's rates expires.

Transmission and distribution rates account for 20% to 25% of a typical
business customer's total power bill - so, a typical bill could rise as much
as 10% with these increases.

Apart from the bottom-line hit to businesses, ComEd competitors and local
government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent
competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from
offering savings from the utility's bundled rate.

AES NewEnergy Inc., the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more
than 800 customers, says 86% of its customers will see their bills increase
if both proposals are approved.

""What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the
point where bundled (utility) service is cheaper, or it's so close that they
wouldn't bother choosing an (alternative) provider,"" says Philip O'Connor,
president of AES NewEnergy's Chicago office. ""You cannot have competition
being viable when your base of potential customers is so small.""

Arlene Juracek, ComEd vice-president of regulatory and strategic services,
counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short
term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a
corresponding decrease in ""transition"" fees paid to the utility when
customers use another supplier.

The Aug. 31 transmission rate proposal, filed with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission,
which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike.

The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEd's
account methodology, in which the utility would wipe off its books more than
$660 million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask
ratepayers to shoulder that investment again.

'Unjust and unreasonable'

In its filing with FERC, the ICC said the proposed change ""would result in
artificially high transmission rates, and an unjust and unreasonable
windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers.""

""They're essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the
game,"" says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill.

ComEd responds that FERC itself - in an order last year pushing utilities to
combine their transmission assets into large, regional networks - said
utilities could consider changing the accounting method.

""ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of (parent
company) Exelon Corp. to receive compensation in accordance with what is
permissible by law,"" says Steven T. Naumann, ComEd vice-president in charge
of transmission services. ""The commission will determine if this is what
they meant (in their order) or if it is not what they meant.""

Meanwhile, the city of Chicago, frustrated by ComEd's resistance to sharing
detailed financial data, is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an
outside audit of ComEd's books for 2000. The state attorney general's office
and the Cook County state's attorney's office are joining the city in the
petition, which could be filed as early as Monday, sources say.

The audit, which ComEd opposes, would be aimed at separating ordinary
maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took
in 1999 and 2000 to beef up its distribution system, after acknowledging it
had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades.

The behind-the-scenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government
officials are taking the regulatory proceedings. While the new rates affect
only those customers in the competitive market, they'll be the benchmark
used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in
2005, when the utility's ""bundled"" rates are no longer frozen.

Setting the rules

""The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future
are getting set now,"" says William Abolt, commissioner of the city's
Department of Environment. ""Basically, the next 36 months are going to set
an awful lot of the fees for the future.""

Mr. Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure
ComEd into opening its books, but says it wouldn't be necessary if the
company agreed to do so voluntarily.

A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a
blanket confidentiality agreement - which intervenors in the case, including
the city, aren't likely to sign.

Ms. Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs
associated with its $1.5-billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate
base. But she allows that most of those are minimal tree-trimming expenses.
Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers, as well as contractor
expenses, are included in the rates.

""There's no free lunch here,"" she says.

Says Mr. Abolt: ""Now, it's time to sort that all out. So, let's sort it
out.""

Ray - it seems highly likely the court will allow FERC to proceed w/ rehearing.  In any case, I doubt an adverse ruling would affect the PNW case as the 7/25 order simply announced the new proceeding.

Subject:	Weird procedural situation

OK, here are the facts as I understand them:  The CPUC filed petitions for review of the FERC's various refund orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There is an unresolved jurisdictional issue that the petitions filed in the Ninth Circuit are incurably premature because they sought review of orders for which the petitioner was also requesting rehearing.  The current status of the CPUC's Ninth Circuit petitions is that the court has not yet dismissed the petitions as premature and FERC must file the record in the Ninth tomorrow, October 26.  At that point, under Section 313 of the Federal Power Act, the jurisdiction of the court of appeals becomes exclusive, and  FERC will not be able to modify the orders under review except by leave of the court.  FERC has filed, and the CPUC is supporting, a motion for an order permitting FERC to keep jurisdiction over its orders so that it can act on the pending rehearing requests.  By all rights, the court should go along with this, but it's gone on this long.  We are not adversely impacted.  Arguably if FERC loses jurisdiction, the PNW and CA refund cases should come to a complete stop, although this is an unlikely scenario.  I will keep you posted of new developments.  Ray

"CalPX Questions How to Refund to Buyers?","Ray --

Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter
they appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to
buyers or they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---

d.	Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these
proceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be
addressed.  CalPX proposes to use its share-fraction allocation method
to determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there
are no specific Commission orders on how to allocate the refunds.

Please let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar
provision in its tariff.

1. Alberta PPA - Transmission Cost Responsibility Hearing 

Enron is leading a coalition of 5 PPA Buyers that successfully advocated the AEUB to convene a process/hearing (the convening of which was opposed by the PPA Owners) to consider the proposal by the Transmission Administrator to apply transmission charges to PPA Buyers for transmission capacity that solely accrues to the financial benefit of PPA Owners.  One week of hearings were held in spring 2001 with the hearing scheduled to be completed in November 2001.  Value to Enron Canada if we prevail at hearing is approximately $Cdn 60 million.

2. Alberta PPA - Alberta Government Agreement to Split Enron's Sundance B PPA in Two PPAs

Government Affairs successfully lobbied Alberta Energy officials and Minister of Energy to agree to approve regulatory changes necessary to allow for the split of Enron's PPA into two PPAs despite one of the fundamental elements of the original PPA model was that the PPAs would be very large and not divisible.  This is important as the whole PPA represents 706 MW and is likely too large for Enron to sell as a whole but a PPA of 303 MW is much more marketable to potential Enron counter parties.

Subject: Legislative Update


The Assembly Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to take
up SBX2 78.  The bill may be taken up by the full Assembly after that,
however, that decision has not been made because several Legislators have
indicated that they may not be in Sacramento tomorrow.

The Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee is going to meet sometime today
off the floor to take up SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott) which would establish a
windfall profits tax.  Additional amendments will be taken that will make
the tax effective on January 1, 2002, define exempt wholesale generator,
marketer, broker, and aggregator, by referencing their PUC definitions, and
exempt QFs.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee will meet upon
adjournment of session today to take up SBX2 39, which would give the CPUC
regulatory authority over non-IOU generation facilities, for
reconsideration.  The bill failed passage during its prior hearing.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee is scheduled to take
up the following bills on September 4 at 1:30 p.m.:

SBX2 85 (Burton) - This bill would prevent the CPUC, upon termination of the
10 percent rate reduction for residential and small commercial customers set
forth in subdivision (a) of Section
368, from subjecting those residential and small commercial customers to any
rate increases or future rate obligations solely as a result of the
termination of the 10 percent rate reduction.

SBX2 18 (Burton) - This bill would establish a dedicated rate component.

I'm going to Carson City tomorrow.  I thought I could present the following message to the Commissioners:    

Contracts were negotiated in a bilateral market at arm's length.  Nobody was requiring NPCo to do business with us.  Similar contracts were upheld by the ALJ in the PNW refunds case.  You're going to completely screw up forward markets and NPCo's ability to contract in the future.  Think of the risk premium that will attach to future contracts.  
We tried to be the good guy with NPCo by offering a more comprehensive solution for them numerous times.  Now we're getting attacked for their mistakes?
We have met with NPCo a number of times to try and resolve this issue.  But the resolution requires that they post collateral.  Now they won't even talk with us.  The only way you (PUCN) are going to fix this is if you step up and require the utilities to post collateral when necessary. 
 
However, after talking with Steve Hall I concluded that it would be unwise at this point for me to contact the Commissioners.  We don't have anything to offer and very little new to say.   For example, according to Steve, we won't touch a blend and extend because of credit problems.  This said, he was uncomfortable saying that the entire issue was collateral.

We are having a conference call tomorrow with PGE.  They did not decide anything on the last conference call after I told them why Enron retail in the East likes the Duquense type imbalance (no bandwidth, thus no penalties-- imbalances settle at verifiable system lambda).  John Malowney of EPMI west desk likes the bandwidth, but we are discussing it further since it has created problems for the East EES desk (due to the penalties associated with being outside the bandwidth).  John likes the PGE proposal to settle at an index price, but PGE is reconsidering that aspect.  

Unfortunately, I don't know of any TPs that allow a bandwidth without penalties.

Leslie -

Can you coordinate with Jay Dudley at 503-464-8860 on how to change the filing (if at all) on PGE's pipeline issue?  PGE is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on Native Load.  They are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity (about 170,000 mmcf/d) rather than assume its right.

The goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next Friday, Aug 17.

Please call me with any questions.

"RE: Draft Comments on Marketing Affiliate NOPR","Here are my thoughts --

1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.
2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a ""monopoly"" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.
3.	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).
4.	The question of ""Holding Company, etc."" -- We should argue for an exemption.
5.	I am also troubled by the ""administer"" term.  FERC should prohibit any ""helping"" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.
6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.
7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.

I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?

Subject:	Report on ""Anti-RTO Bill"" and on Andy Black Meeting


This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall.

1.  H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC))

On Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess), the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814, the Interstate Transmission Act.  The legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs.  Also objectionable is that the bill would ""limit"" pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a ""reasonable transition mechanism or period"" for additive charges.  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO.  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any RTO.

In addition to the RTO language, the bill has the ""old"" version of the NERC reliability legislation in it.  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs, repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company.

Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district.  Rep. Burr is from North Carolina, so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him.  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue.  Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below).

2.  Andy Black Meeting

Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation.  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron, Reliant, Dynegy and TXU.  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day.  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes, the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment.  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill, the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee.  Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues.

a.   RTOs

Chairman Barton supports RTOs.  At a minimum, the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested.  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation.  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs.  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  However, Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above, which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs.  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs.  Hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects.  I will strongly encourage him to ""do the right thing"" in that regard.

b.   PUHCA

The draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101).  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill.  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate.

c.  PURPA

Prospective repeal.  On back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state.

d.   Interconnection

They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like.  I am contacting EPSA to get the details.

e.   Net Metering

They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require ""net metering.""  I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve; that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday).  I need to get more information to Andy.

f.   Transmission Jurisdiction

Thankfully, Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction.  Specifically, the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.

g.   Siting

On siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.

h.   Reliability

On a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.

i.   Negawatts

I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the ""California bill"" earlier this summer.

Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome.

Very well put.  This is another example why it is so important for you and Andy R. to be out with the RTO teams helping us to be more precise.  We need to blend our NERC and FERC advocacy.

Of course, you realize that ELCON will never support a PJM model central marketplace for balancing energy.  At the last EPSA meeting, ELCON really blasted centralized pools.

Subject:	RE: SE RTO INTERREGIONAL COORDINATION

John 

You are correct in your observations concerning market dynamics and the need for flexibility by the marketplace.  ""Control area consolidation risks rebundling the industry and this would stifle innovation and market
dynamics.""  Enron agrees with this observation and does not endorse an RTO structure that perpetuates the advantages control areas enjoy today in the marketplace.

We fully support your statement: ""Our efforts should be directed at ensuring adequate independence of balancing, security and interchange authorities.""

Enron's desire for consolidation of control areas can be misconstrued to advocate the old bundled control area structures.  I want to clarify this is absolutely NOT the case and Enron DOES support the CACTF model.  Specifically, the Interchange Authority functions called for in the CACTF model must NOT be rolled up into a single entity.  The Security Authority(SA), the Transmission Service Provider(TSP), and the Balancing  Authority(BA) all need to be separated from today's transmission owner/generation owner/load serving/control area operator entities.  Independence of these functions from market interest are critical to ensure fair and competitive markets.  

The Interchange Authority (IA) functions do not require centralization or independence from market participants - but rather the scheduling advantages that the IA functions provide for must be available to every market participant.  Today, the entities that operate a ""control area"" are advantaged by the capabilities NERC rules provide under the Interchange Authority.  Under a contract path transmission model, control areas do not have to keep day-ahead balanced schedules and can ""play"" in the energy market with unbalanced portfolios up until the schedule ramping times.  Non-control areas can only get transactions approved for scheduling under specific source and sink requirements that forces them to submit balanced interchange schedules.  This is a major reason why competitive generators have sought to become NERC certified control areas.  The CACTF model allows for the scheduling functions required of an IA to be disaggregated from the other ""control area"" functions without detriment to reliability - thus levelizing the playing field for all competitive PSEs.

To levelize the playing field, Enron supports 2 issues.
1) Consolidation of control areas - to provide independence to eliminate the market advantages. 
2) Elimination of day ahead balanced schedules requirements - to effectively provide the benefits of the IA function for all market players.  If there are no day-ahead balanced scheduling requirements, most of the competitive advantages of control areas will be eliminated.  In the same stroke, all market participants will compete on the same data and timing requriements allowing for the trading of energy up until the ramping times as control areas enjoy today.  This is the scheduling flexibility Enron seeks to create a dynamic energy trading environment.

Subject:	SE RTO INTERREGIONAL COORDINATION

Luiz:
I have reviewed the documents you distributed on Friday regarding Enron's
position on interregional coordination.  In general, we agree with Enron's
position with the following exceptions.  We do believe that the
consolidation of ""control areas"" is a useful objective in the context of
creating a greater SE RTO, and, in fact, is inconsistent with Enron's
support of the CACTF's reliability model.  The RTO should also not be a
central dispatcher.  Its control of generation should be limited to
redispatch for congestion management and the maintenance of short-term
reliability.  The basic premise behind the CACTF model is that control
areas are becoming obsolete and unbundled.  Control area consolidation
risks rebundling the industry and this would stifle innovation and market
dynamics.  Our efforts should be directed at ensuring adequate independence
of balancing, security and interchange authorities.  This should be done by
FERC because NERC has no authority (or inclination) to do so.

Subject:	RE: Summary of ""Final Draft"" of NERC ""Electric Reliability Organization"" Legislation

Bullet 4:
FERC cannot directly ""amend"" a proposed standard (I was told this is because the Canadians would object to FERC telling them what to do directly); however, FERC can remand a proposed standard to the ERO for a modification by a date certain.  The proposed standard is not implemented until the modification is made.  (In some cases, a proposed standard takes effect automatically if FERC fails to act on the proposed standard within a specified period of time.)

At the GISB - EPSA meeting last Thurs, the GISB people clearly stated that GISB has NO authority over its members, it is 100% voluntary.  All the muscle lies in FERC and any governmental agency that is willing to adopt the GISB standard.  Agencies in Mexico for example have adopted certain GISB standards.  In fact, ANSI acreditaion requires that the standards setting organization NOT to have authority.  So it makes sense for FERC to not amend a proposed standard since other agencies will have to be able to adopt it.(e.g.- Canada)  I don't see a problem with this - but this makes the consensus building process even more important since the final product must be amenable to any and all relevant governement authorities.  

This is a good reason why the legislation cannot give deference to the ERO, especially one which proposes to have compliance and enforcement authority as NERC's proposal.  If NERC is going to set standards AND have compliance authority over its members - then the ANSI acreditation they claim to be getting will not be the same as that of GISB.  ANSI does not allow this combination.  If the deference language is in the legislation - that means the GISB/EISB proposal is excluded from FERC's choice.  FERC needs to be aware of this.  So why does the voluntary GISB process with FERC oversight model work? 

It is the very nature of knowing FERC has final authority that makes the consensus building process work - not the threat of the ERO's compliance authority over its members as NERC approaches this.  In GISB, the  members know that if they do not produce a standard that all its members and FERC can live with - FERC will not adopt it, nor can FERC amend it - and since no enforcement mechanism will be behind the mis-guided standard (remember it is 100% voluntary), it becomes a worthless exercise.  This is a powerful incentive.   

On the other hand, NERC's approach of a standards organization with enforcement power sets the stage for power struggles between sectors and knocks down the consensus building attitude the GISB process encourages.   Compliance and penalites are not assigned or targeted to every member/sector.  Certain parties are impacted by certain standards - and in different ways. For example - a congestion management standard will affect a control area very differently than it would a power marketer.  The penalites may not apply at all to the marketers who want to protect themselves by making the congestion management penalites as harsh as possible and vice versa for the control areas.  If the ERO doles out compliance without FERC approval - then the standards will become a battleground over compliance and penalties. The point is the enforcement and penalty debate will drive sector arguments and will cloud the real task of developing an equitable congestion management standard.

Attached is a summary I did of the key points in the Final Draft of the NERC reliability legislation, as amended yesterday.  While it is now shorter than the old version, and some of the objectional features have been deleted or watered down, I assume we still do not support the final version.  We and others who attended these meetings have been asked to provide our comments and position by close of business on Thursday, August 16th.  I thought the summary would help highlight the major features so we can evaluate the final version in light of our concerns and interests in this subject.  Your comments are welcome.

Subject:	New York regulatory restriccions

As a result of last Monday's gas meeting, today I attended a meeting with Barry Vanderhorst (EES), Paul Tate (EES) and Matthew Fleming (EWS) about the problems we are facing to supply New York State customers.
According to what they explained these problems have two main reasons:
1.	The PUC requirement that marketers should sign an affidavit stating that they have firm transportation to provide firm customers at city gate during winter. 
2.	The LDCs requirement that marketers must supply customers using a transmission mix (60%/40%, 70%/30%, etc) from different pipelines. This requirement prevents marketers from purchasing capacity only from the cheapest pipeline. Marketers are forced to purchase some capacity from expensive pipelines.

We agreed that there are two different cases:
1.	When Enron must use the LDC firm transportation capacity to comply with the PUC requirement. In this case the LDC could argue that they must allocate the FT capacity to free and captive customers with the same mix they have contracted with the different pipelines. If they allocated the cheap capacity to free customers, captive customers could have to pay a higher price, and this could be resisted by the PUC. The validity of this argument depends on the features of the pass through mechanism that is in place in every case.
Unless you know of (or we find out) other reasons, we considered that in these cases we should send a letter to the LDC (eventually with copy to the PUC) asking how was determined the required percentage mix.

2.	When we do not need to use the LDC firm transportation capacity to comply with the PUC requirement. In this case we did not find a clear reason for the LDC to require the marketer to purchase a transportation mix. The marketer is not using the LDC's capacity and should be allowed to reach the city gate from every possible pipeline.
Unless there is a valid reason, in these cases we considered that we should send a letter to the LDC, asking why do they make that requirement, which are their legal foundations, and how was determined the required percentage mix.

They will send me a mail with the mix requirement of every LDC, explaining in which cases we would have to use the LDC capacity.

We also discussed the case of Rochester Gas & Electric. This LDC has a deregulation program that only allocates 10% of their capacity to marketers.  Besides whenever there is an unbalance, part of it is considered as an injection to storage, but the rest is subject to the pipeline's penalties. They considered we need a higher injection right to storage. We agreed to discuss the issue after analyzing the rate schedule involved (SC5).

Melinda and I will look at the PUC regulations to try to find the answers to the above questions before preparing the letters.

Please let me know if this plan is OK with you.
Regards
Guillermo

Subject: Enron/Dynegy Transaction and Affiliate Rules



I received a call this evening from our V&E regulatory counsel (Adam Wenner) who received a call from Dynegy's regulatory attorney, Dan King, about the need for both companies to making filings at FERC to notify FERC of the proposed acquisition and to state that, during the pendency of the acquisition, both companies will treat each other as if the two were already merged (i.e., the standards of conduct and affilate rules will apply).  

Under FERC's regulations, as of the date of the agreement, Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore, Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services, all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.

We will work with the attorneys to make these filings, but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.

We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g., you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).

Let us know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Credit Rating Isuses - ISOs



I am concerned with the credit worthiness issues with the various ISOs, and I am seeking your comments/advice on the appropriate action items that GA should take to assist the various sections in Enron to comply with the requirements in an expedient, proactive,  and cost-effective manner.    
1.	Perhaps I should start by mentioning that in NYISO, and PJM (and I assume the same for the rest), there is an obligation on the market participants for informing the ISO (some in writing, within 5 business days as the case in PJM) of any Material change in its financial condition.  The issue here should GA assist in communicating this change.   
2.	Does the Team agree that there is a need to determine exactly what are the conditions for posting a financial instrument.  How the instrument size is calculated (hence the total additional obligation)? how does it change with the change in our business volumes, or credit rating? are the terms for the financial instruments applied consistently to all market agents or just on Enron?
3.	What is the best approach to assist RAC in prioritizing which financial instrument should be dealt with first, if there is a prioritization process.  

I do have language for PJM, and NYISO if you would like to have access to them.  

I look forward for your comments and suggestions

Many thanks and Brgrds

They are saying that the credits are listed as part of Schedule F of their bankruptcy filing and cannot be reinstated.  Mike also commented that they do not view this as a billing dispute and will refer us to Rule 22, Section L. 2. e &f, ESP responsibilities.

Janet Covington, SCE, said their legal and credit team are crafting a response.  She did not have a feel for how SCE will view our request.  I think it might be a good time to contact Steve Kean.

FYI, Ray and I spoke to Ron Carroll today about setting up a brief conference call with Gov Rasacot (sp?) to share with him some points about WestConnect and the fact that it is NOT the savior of the West Wide RTO.

Ron will be trying to set up a call.  Ron was wondering what or how we wanted Gov R. to handle the information.  Both Ray and I felt it was more to give him our perspective so when he was party to discussions relating to WestConnect he would be prepared to refute some of the claims.  Ray and I were both assuming that we were not proposing to have the Gov lobby on our behalf...is that accurate?

I will keep you informed of any other conversations relating to this matter.

Linda, 

Regarding the grid safety issue, you will remember that I mentioned
yesterday that Saxby Chambliss has been tapped by the Speaker to coordinate
the terrorism package. I spoke with Krister Holladay of Chambliss' office
today, who is staffing that effort and he said he would be more than happy
to look at any and all proposals and suggestions that we have on grid
safety. He hasn't seen anything yet on this issue and would welcome our
input. 

If the folks in Houston can identify two or three (or more) things that can
be done to enhance safety that also move grid management in the direction we
want it to go generally, this will be a fine opportunity to broaden our
coalition on transimission / rto's. 

It looks like we have an open door here. Let me know what you want me to do.

The back out credits are set at 0.5 mills per kWh for S.C. 13 customers (industrial); 2.0 mills per kWh for S.C. 3 customers (large commercial); 3.0 mills per kWh for S.C. 2 demand customers (small commercial); and 4 mills per kWh for S.C. 2 non-demand, S.C. 6 and S.C. 1 customers (residential).  Theses back out credits will be in effect until the completion of the Unbundling Proceeding where at that time the credits determined from that proceeding will supercede the above credits. 

As for improvement in the market, are you referring to the retail market? If so, I think EES will be able to start marketing in CH territory because not only are we eligible for back out credits, all customers (including retail access customers) are entitled to benefits from the transition power agreement (TPA) with Dynegy and the purchase power agreement (PPA) with Constellation.

Subject:	FW message from ISO


NOTE: WE RECEIVED THIS PROPOSED SCHEDULE  FROM THE ISO AND ARE  FORWARDING IT ALL THE PARTIES ON OUR LIST AND ON SCE'S LIST.  PLEASE NOTE  THAT THEY INCLUDE THE ADDRESS TO  FAX YOUR NON-DISLOSURE STATEMENT TO SO WE  CAN GET THE DATA..
       Aug  9   ISO provides mitigated prices together with a write-up  
                   of its methodology and two attachments: gas prices and  
                   heat rates 
        Aug 14  ISO provides Transaction data (sales by bid segment)  
        Aug 17  ISO provides refund amounts by seller 
                   (The remaining items that are on Staff's proposal  
                    under the date of Aug 15th) 
        Aug 24  Initial pre-filed testimony by all 
        Aug 31  Responsive testimony by all 
        Sept 5  (The items listed on Staff's proposal for Aug 22,  absent 
                 the  Protective Order which already has been dealt with) 
        Sept 6-13  Hearing 
        Sept 21  Briefing by all, including proposed findings of fact  
                    with citations to the record support  
         
        In putting together the above schedule the ISO was as aggressive as it  could be in making the essential data available.  Although it will not be  possible to provide everything on the 9th, what will be provided on that date  (the mitigated prices and their derivation) will allow the parties to get  started on the most important, and possibly controversial, data set, and will  include the items covered by the Order issued by Chief Judge Wagner.  The  above schedule does afford Judge Birchman 10 days to prepare his findings and  still comply with the 45 day limitation if he is willing to commence that 45-day  schedule on Aug 17th, the date on which the ISO would complete the above  submission.  If Judge Birchman does not believe that he is free to do so in  light of the Commission Order, we would urge that he certify to the Commission  our joint request for a modest extension.  (We do believe that the ISO will  be in compliance, certainly substantially so, with the data that it is to  produced within the specified 15-day period and we read the Commission Order as  intending to provide the ALJ a full 45 days from the completion of the data  submission.)
   
        There is another important process issue that we have got to put in place  IMMEDIATELY.  May I please prevail on you to include in your transmittal to  all of the parties that they should fax a signed copy of the Non-Disclosure  Certificate to Stacey Karpenin at the ISO (mailing the original to her).   Stacey's fax number is (916) 608-7296 (her phone number is (916)  608-7273).  In the transmittal to Stacey the ISO should be advised of the  Company name and its billing code (there will be charges associated with  preparing the disk as well as air courier charges), the person to whom the  materials are to be sent together with that individual's address, phone and fax  numbers. Upon receipt of the faxed signature page the ISO will air courier ONE  set of the materials to the designated individual. The ISO can only assure that  it will be able to air courier the materials for delivery on the 9th if it is in  receipt of the Non-Disclosure Statement and the above information by 3 PM (PDT)  on the 8th.

I have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that ""passes thru"" congestion.  There may be some billing and settlement issues given ERCOT's systems.  Basically, we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was.  I want to make sure that EES billing can determine how to charge this?

Who should I talk with?

Subject: RE: ICAP


I know.  Anyway, the single most important issue from the perspective of Retail seems to be ""daily granularity"".  We need to be able to adjust our daily obligation based on customer switching patterns.  These can occur at any time.  So any thing that locks in our capacity requirement for a long period of time (months to a year or more) can be a killer.  
 
A specific model we discussed was ""operating capacity"".  This takes the operating reserves concept and blows it up to a full capacity market equivalent.  ISO administers the market.  Generators commit capacity to energy market or reserve market, but not both.  Long term deals possible as well as real time market.  Lots has to be flushed out but it seems like a viable approach. 
 
Will discuss more on Wednesday.  Have talked briefly with Luiz about this.

Enron can never take the position that ICAP is good!  I don't know why Stoness is trying to undertake more analysis.  His reasoning that ICAP is ""complicated"" and we do well at complications is crazy given the EES business model - Enron Direct.

Subject: FW: ICAP






[Kingerski, Harry]  We can meet today at 2 pm in room 4746 to discuss more about Retail's view of ICAP and related issues.   

  
  

Scott Stoness' summary of our meeting yesterday with Dale Furrow, his regional leads, and Narsimha Misra: 

The gist of the meetings was: 

1) Pro ICAP was: 

Pragmatically, high energy costs are bad because they delay competition.  ICAP is therefore good because it reduces the high price periods with market intervention. 
Pragmatically, ICAP is complicated, and complicated translucent rules favor the bright (Enron). 
Mathematically, 2 separate markets - Capacity and Energy - should result in the same outcome.  ie. Energy costs should reduce to exactly offset the increase in demand charges. 
Theorectically, if the market expects the government to intervene in the event of high power costs, suppliers will build less capacity than needed.  Given that this is inevitable (government intervention), we might as well intervene now as later. 
Theorectically, market failure is probable because small customers are not able to internalize the costs of not hedging, causing them to take more risk than they should.  Given that the customers are not making the right societal decision, we should make it for them 


2) Pro Not ICAP was: 

Any artificial price determination will distort the market causing inefficiencies.  ie. a fixed ICAP for 12 months will favor a technology available all year round. ie2. ICAP could cause environmental damage by causing CT's to be built instead of Combined Cycle. 
ICAP, with market, is complicated which will decrease market efficiencies 
Market prices, with financial firm obligations, will result in a continuous balance of supply and demand 
Market prices, will result in much more efficiency because they cause more demand side response. 


Conclusion: 

There was no consensus.  There seemed to be more people on the no ICAP side than the ICAP side.  Basically comes down to i) economics suggests ICAP is inefficient, vs ii) lack of ICAP will damage competition. 
We agreed that if ICAP is inevitable, we should advocate, market determined ICAP's 
We agreed that, given that this issue is controversial, and that Narshima has the largest interests.  He should head up our response.

Subject:	DOE Meeting Dec 7th

Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA members in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a wholesale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri.

Thanks for the information on the switching of the ""held"" customers.  We will process through a standard EDI transaction.

I am trying to find out who would work up the credit amount.  When I find out, I'll e-mail you.

Jim:

Sorry we have played phone-tag.

The couple issues I wanted to talk with you about are 1) the reference in
your Dec 4 letter regarding re-enrolling customers for switching to Enron,
and 2) the listing of Massachusetts Electric as a creditor in Enron's
bankruptcy filing.

The pending switches of the 1013 customer accounts were canceled based upon
our conversation last week.  This does not put them on 'hold' for a later
switch, since that is not feasible or appropriate.  The customers simply
remain on their former rate (Default Service or Standard Offer) until they
choose otherwise.  When/If Enron wishes to re-initiate a switch for the
customers, you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch
transaction as usual.  If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier,
the switch would be processed.  We assume you'd take care of any contract
updating that needed to be addressed with the customers, as that is a matter
between you and them.  Hope that clarifies.  Please let me know if
questions.

Have you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could
answer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the
creditor section of the bankruptcy filing?  We'd like to speak with someone
ASAP.  Thanks.

Subject:	RE: Proposal re CalPX Methodologies

It seems to me that FERC's July 25 Order required Judge Birchman to make
findings about the exact amounts owed by each buyer to each seller.  The
proposal to establish methodologies does exactly that, among other things.
Therefore, it seems to me that it needs to be part of the the pending
California proceedings.

That is not to say, however, that it should not also be part of the
Chargeback proceedings under the April 6 FERC order.  It should also be
applicable to those proceedings.

Therefore, we need to develop a strategy to make it part of both
proceedings.  Timing is obviously critical, and I am soliciting the
Chargeback movants' views on that subject along with the substance of the
proposal.  I would like to point out that I have learned from the settlement
proceedings before Judge Wagner that we must submit the proposal early in
the proceedings to ensure that they are considered and can have an impact.

I sent an email to Ron Carroll letting him know that I am available for a
conference call at the following times:

Weds Aug 22 after 11 am Pacific time,
Thurs Aug 23 prior to 1 pm Pacific time,
Fri Aug 24 anytime except 1130 am to 2 pm Pacific time

Please let me know when we can discuss this further.  Thanks for your help.

Please review the attached draft statement / talking points for EPMI and PGE and get me comments by COB Monday.  One question is whether we need to change what PGE is proposing to say in light of our position (rule certainty, make any changes to caps consistently accross the WSCC).

I will be meeting with the West Desk folks on Tuesday morning (schedules permitting).  Please let me know if you want to participate in that meeting.

Here is who I think will be on these panels thusfar:
California Rep. Anna Eshoo (D Atherton)

Allegheny Supply (anybody know who might be speaking for them?)
Powerex/TGF Richard Tabors (note that Enron is a member of TGF but has made it clear it is not funding this effort)
PGE Mike Naeve
EMPI Alan Comnes
CAISO
Puget Energy - Kimberly Harris
and 5  other parties
BPA and WPTF will not be speaking.
I was told Commissioners ""may"" be present.

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks for the external view on legislation.  I agree that most of the bills don't ""get it right"" - the hope is that the FERC can do that without too much legislative guidance (which of course would be wrong).  Not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work - not enough $$ to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities.

Jim:

Thank you for your thoughtful response.  Even if Enron is a ""hot button""
these days, we remain big fans of yours.

In regard to your comments on the letter, I disagree with some of the
assertions.

First, I am fairly confident that no major piece of energy legislation
will be passed this year.  As you can see from the attached
congressional update for the DE Task Force prepared by Bev Jones (former
VP for Consolidated Natural Gas), Jimmy Hayes (former Member of
Congress, and Nancy Etkin (former head of Natural Gas Vehicle
Coalition), there is every indication that legislation is going to get
bottled up in the Senate.  I agree with the assessment.

Moreover, the legislation that is being considered has almost nothing in
it of direct relevance to ""getting it right"" in regard to restructuring.
Without pressure, I expect no federal leadership on restructuring
issues.  While I do agree that commissions are usually a stalling
tactic, both Ken and I are dismayed at the lack of focus, resources
(i.e., DOE has devoted almost nothing of any sort to restructuring) and
lack of qualified personnel directed at promoting more competition in
the energy market.  While you and I may have some idea of what is
necessary (and that is a stretch for me -- given the complexity of the
challenges), I can safely say the vast majority of folks have no idea
what to do -- especially about the tricky jurisdictional questions
involved.

I personally think one way to craft a ""new federalism"" on restructuring
is to bribe the states into more action.  The federal government does
this with education, housing, etc.  Why not with restructuring?  A
carrot for those states which are moving forward, linked to definite
metrics of progress and openness.

I also strongly believed that state PUCS and federal agencies like FERC
are being pushed to the limit about what they can accomplish given
declining budgets and personnel.  I further think that this slows the
whole process down.  Think about it -- telephone deregulation, a growing
crisis in regard to water, record levels of mergers and acquisitions,
historic changes in regard to natural gas and electric regulation -- all
piled on top of each other for these folks.

Good catch on the numbering of the recommendations cited in the letter.
This has been corrected.

I look forward to seeing you in September at the Board meeting.

Jamie

P.S.   Speaking of the DE Task Force, have you and Bob Frank made a
decision yet to participate?  I hope you do, but I need to know as soon
as possible.

Subject: Letter from Leadership Council to Bush WH

Jamie --

Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am
always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither
I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.

First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your
messages.  Enron is a ""hot button"" in DC and will change the proper
focus.

In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national
commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and
Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would
delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against
competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move
away from the commission.

Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that
promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a
distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.

Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will
only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.
While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we
haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working.

Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney
plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no
such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.

If you want to talk, please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

"ISSUE:  SCE Failure to Apply Past Credit Due to Current Utility Charges","Bob --

Before we do anything on this issue, I would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues (primarily the proper reformation of the PX Credit calculation after Jan 18 and the application of the 1c/kwh surcharge).

On this issue, assuming that we haven't discuss the failure of SCE to apply our account's past credit with the CPUC (given that the bills were just received), I can't imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action.  

In addition, we have not identified where the ""credits"" are if they are not on the customer's accounts.  

My recommendation is to first (a) work with SCE - have Jeff Dasovich run the traps and (b) discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint. 

If this doesn't get us anywhere before August 19, then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC.  I am not opposed to LeBouef looking into federal action, but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies.

Please call me.

Jim

P.S. There is a meeting on the 1c/kwh surcharge with Janet Dietrich today at 1:30 in her office.  I think you should attend.

Subject:	PX Credit Claim

Now that we have the SCE bills showing that they are not going to credit past PX Credits against the T&D charges, here is the preliminary plan for challenging SCE's (and PG&E's anticipated) action.  As Diann explained, the bills begin becoming past due August 19, with late fees of 1.5% accruing thereafter.  Disconnect notices could be received 30 days thereafter, or about September 19.  Our target date for filing is Monday, August 20.  

     1.  Charley Ferguson (LeBoef Lamb) will prepare an analysis of the pro's and con's of challenging the action in federal court versus at the CPUC (considering, e.g., bias of CPUC, timing, disconnect protection, etc.).  Charley will draft alternative Complaints.   He will get the input of the bankruptcy lawyers on the draft PG&E complaint.  I will circulate these drafts as soon as they are available.

     2.  Charley will first meet with Jeanne Bennett for a ""download.""  After that meeting he will likely also wish to speak with Wanda and Diann for additional background information.  (Thank you for your generosity with your time.)

     3.  I will check with Sue Mara to see what, if anything, the other ESPs may be planning to do to challenge SCE's action.  Not many still have direct access customers, but some do.

     4.  I will talk to Jim Steffes about an unofficial approach to SCE.

Please let me know if I have missed anything, and I would appreciate it if you would forward this along to anyone else who you think may like to have this information.  Thanks.

In terms of our proposal, went over it with Wanda and Michael last week, and they, I believe, ran it by Swain.  The real issue is what (if anything) we do about Edison's desire to lock down undercollection and DWR stranded costs as part of the deal (which they likely view as a pretty good hedge, since it's looking less than 50-50 that the Legislature isn't going to pull it off).

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

RE: Reliability Meeting
       ?Monday, August 20th, 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

The Legislative and Regulatory Affairs Committees have scheduled a meeting on reliability legislation for Monday, August 20th from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm at EPSA's offices, 1401 New York Avenue, NW.  Lunch will be provided.  The purpose of the meeting is to review and discuss specific legislative proposals in order to develop fundamental positions on reliability legislation.  The proposals now being considered both on Capitol Hill and at FERC reflect dramatically different approaches.  Whichever is ultimately pursued will have significant implications for the scope of FERC jurisdiction and perhaps the nature or reliability standards themselves.
We have invited representatives from NERC and PJM, as well as Bonnie Suchman and Cindy Bogorad - all of whom have worked on different proposals on reliability.  These individuals will make presentations in support of their respective approaches and to answer any questions that EPSA members may have.

We expect this meeting will provide a meaningful opportunity for EPSA members with an interest in this issue to obtain a better understanding of competing proposals and related issues and to participate in the development of a unified approach.  If you or someone from your company would like to attend this meeting, please fill out the form below and either fax or email it to Michael Reddy at 202-628-8260 or mreddy@epsa.org.  If you have any questions, please contact EPSA Senior Manager of Policy Mark Bennett (mbennett@epsa.org) or Donn Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs (dsalvosa@epsa.org) at (202) 628-8200.

____ Yes, I would like to attend the Joint Regulatory/Legislative Affairs Committees Meeting on Reliability on Monday, August 20th from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

"RE: TXU","Dave --

With EES' push into serving smaller customers, the issues in this situation -- potential affiliate abuse and unfair sharing of information -- will become more important.  When EES focused on national outsourcing, this was less an issue because our products crossed many jurisdictions.  

This issue, of course, is especially important in recently opened or opening markets as the affiliates try and secure large market share.  We are also watching for these activities in places like MI, VA, and OH.

We believe the interface between the AREP (Reliant and TXU Energy Services) and the utility may constitute a violation of the respective utility Code of Conduct.  However, my initial thought is to insist that we have the same access to the data that TXU and Reliant use for their statistics and product offerings.  I have contacted both the utility and the energy services company (only Reliant so far) to find out how our IT folks can obtain the same data.  As expected, Reliant has been less than willing to answer the question directly.  I have left voice mail with the Regulatory VP twice.  He gets one more chance.

Here are the sites.

I pulled up TXU Energy Services' website and did a little browsing. Do you think the retail energy services group is utilizing information re: customer accounts that the regulated utility has? i.e. consumption data, current pricing, etc? If so, isn't this illegal under the electricity Code of Conduct rules in Texas? If any end user in TU's territory could access that type of information through the retail website, I would think it would be a problem.

Any thoughts?

Subject: Judge's Final SE RTO Mediation Report + CN summary


The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast Power Grid platform that resulted from the mediation. 
 
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Model (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remaining unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  However, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its determination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should encourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by the parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FERC orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a model and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that parties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject her recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-type discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our suggested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholder participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  While she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not adopt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day 2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).
 
The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the Grid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (without any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed changes to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest 
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, regardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC 
Her opinion is that the ""Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility sponsored) Model"" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion management) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No. 2000 based on a ""best practices"" analysis of other RTOs and Commission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, etal.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model is not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsibilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below: 
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was added to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission owner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would administer the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and transmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She strongly encourages this split. 
Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets 
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), with RTO oversight 
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pursuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be subject to further discussion) 
RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including rate changes and tariff filings 
All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their rights should they win on appeal) 
4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and GridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant transmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existing facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those above).  There will be one ""through and out rate"", plus a Grid Management Charge for RTO operation. 
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT 
Financial Rights/LMP (includes ""real time spot market"") is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many details need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH).  Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation, auction and non-discriminatory release.  The Grid model includes a ""balancing resource"" requirement that we will provide comments against 
Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market establishment 
RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC 
RTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process 
Numerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functions (all of our comments from last week's response are included) 
Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many are still concerned that FERC had not conducted a ""cost-benefit"" analysis and had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the ""economies of scale"" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure.  In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shifting:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allowed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into retail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant ""jump start"" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Judge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the initial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a ""best practices"" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with LMP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent board structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process.  The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a minimum, consider similar mediated ""jump starts.""

Jim - What is your position regarding Fla in the SE RTO?  Do we want to fight the fight with the Fla. PSC or are we willing to accept Fla as a stand alone at this point, and let things sort out in the rest of the SE first.  I believe Staines thinks that we will lose ground in Fla rolling them up into the SE RTO?  I probably agree with that statement and also believe we will rattle the Fla PSC's cage with little or no chance of winning the argument.  Thoughts? SM

My contact, JR Rohrbaugh, called back. He says that ICAP was explicitily included in the market value of the plants in the model.  The yearly market value had an energy componet and a capacity componet with the assumption that the capacity was compensation for installed capacity.  This revenue, less incremental cost of running the plants was the annual cash value of the plants which was then present valued.  That number less the book value was the stranded cost of the generation assets.   Hope this helps.  If Jim wants to talk to JR directly I have his number or e-mail.

Colleagues:

This is a quick note to let you know that with the help of GA Information (Elizabeth Linnell), the Fundamentals Group is starting to populate the functioning ISO Regulatory database.  The structure of the database (which will remain open to incorporate any of your suggestions)  is outlined below (it includes the latest comments from Christi and Thane).
 
The target customer group of this product is the traders either directly (by having access to the database) or,  and preferably,  via you in the field.   

The final product will be in Excel format, that through MS Access it should enable you to create a very flexible comparative reporting mechanism. An example would be a report on the rules of conflict resolution process across all the functioning ISO's in the country, and so on.  

The time table of this project in two phases is as follows:

Phase One:  It shall end by October 12th and shall include the following ISO's.

Linda Lawrence is kind to help us with a support database in which all the seminal documents for each ISO are kept so that to allow you to check the original document if you would like to substantiate, or challenge,  the findings of the database.        

The second stage of the project is to link it to the current RTO process.  However, this is a slightly different issue, and shall be communicated to you as it becomes more stable.  

I shall keep you posted with progress, meanwhile, please let me know if you have any question.

Attached is the most recent statement from the California Utilities that implements the DA Suspension (filed Friday). Comments are due Nov 28 (Wed) from parties.  

The Utilities continue push for a ""hard"" deadline of DA.  They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.  Of course, in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have DA service if the customer's name was not on our Oct 5 Customer List.

Jeff and I will be talking with Mike Smith (and anyone else who wants to participate) to work through our response to these comments.

Subject:	FW: November 1st Gas Issues Conference Call-- 3:30 p.m.

Most of the discussion was regarding the NOPR on Allowance of Partial Day Recalls of Released Capacity. This would be a possibility only for LDCs. Comments should be submmitted around Nov 19. It was considered disruptive for the market. Discos argue they need this possibility in order to increase reliability. The problem is that the release capacity would be less attractive if distcos are given this possibility (the value of release capacity would be lower than IT). It was mentioned that this could lead to the use of daily balancing. The main fear is that State Commissions could order Discos to keep the recall right in their release.
They plan to talk to INGAA about this issue and said they would appreciate any feedback to talk to INGAA.

On other issue, it was mentioned the due date for comments about the Affiliate transaction NOPR was moved to Dec. 20.

The next conference call will be December 4 (Tuesday) at 3:30 pm.

Looks very good.  We need to stress the points on what we need FERC to do -- fix their mistakes in the Rehearing.  One other point, maybe we should stress that FERC could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the Cal ISO is taking so long.  Also, don't be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the ""abuses"" of the Cal ISO and its lack of independence.

All, attached is the first draft of talking points which Jim asked me to draft for use in a possible lobbying effort regarding rehearing of FERC's July 25 Order.  The ""message"" is that the scope of the California ""refund hearing"" should be expanded to address the question of whether refunds are appropriate in the first place, and that the parties to the California hearing should be granted the same due process opportunities which were afforded the parties in the Pacific Northwest hearing.  Please let me have your comments and recommendations.  Ray

Subject:	Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost Recov	ery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement

On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday).

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

Christi/Sarah--you guys are probably aware of this, but just in case you aren't, there was an article in the Minneapolis paper yesterday that Xcel (NSP) had filed on Friday with FERC to transfer it's transmission system to a new company called TransLink Transmission Co.  Joining them are Alliant, Corn Belt Coop (Iowa), Mid AMerican, NPPD, and OPPD.  

I noted that there was a quote in the article that ""Xcel estimates that it would cut its overal transmission related fees by more than a thrid through it's participation in Translink.......because there will be less overlap of functions.""

The meeting on the Belmont County - Ormet project that I arranged with the coal office and related agencies went very well.  Enron's coal plant development group is preparing an application and we will be exploring with the Ohio Air Quality Dev't Authority both traditional and creative new financing structures.  I will be arranging a follow-up meeting in a few weeks.  If this goes well, we could develop other projects in Ohio.

Jim,  I contacted Doug Nichols of PGE on this, and the matter has to do with ""Edison Bailout"" bill (SBXX78).  Sue Mara is aware of this bill and a recent e-mail from her indicates that the bill was scheduled to be voted on yesterday and that it would suspend direct access as of 8/25.  I expect that Sue will report on the outcome of yesterday's vote.  In any event, Howard Weg, who represents PGE in the PX and PG&E bankruptcies, was asking if PGE was interested in supporting the legislation, but PGE declined to do so.  So... that's where the matter stands- it appears to be a moot issue.  Ray

This is the latest status on Howard's effort - PGE is included in the ""in favor"" group in Howard's message - but both Al and I have since let him know he should not include us as being ""in favor"" unless and until we've coordinated this with Enron - I'm relying on you to do that.  Time is very short - Howard needs to be moving on this now if he has any shot at all of influencing the outcome.  While I agree the message ought to be delivered, I'm not optimistic there is time for the legislature to do anything else at this point.  If nothing else, it would be good let the decision makers know that their plan may not have the hoped for result, so they can't say no one told them.  dn

Subject:  RE:New Unofficial Committee Contacting Decision Makers

Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the 1 billion shortage to sellers.  We're still trying to get Enron guidance on this.  Possibly we'd rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution.  I'm traveling with my  cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central.  Please stand by in terms of adding our name to the agressive list. Sorry for the mixed signals.  al

>>> ""Howard J. Weg"" <hweg@pgwlaw.com> 08/28/01 09:35PM >>>
I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding
my email dated August 27, 2001 with respect to the proposal to contact the
Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE.

Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have
suggested that the message is too strong.  Our Ex Officio members BPA and
WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with
addressing the state government on this or other issues.  As you know, I
want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is
possible, and to protect the interests of all members.

Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against
SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for
bankruptcy or litigation.  After all, the Unofficial Committee was organized
to provide a different approach generally.  The purpose of contacting the
Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they
are now considering, which leaves SCE about $1 billion short on the proposed
financing to pay creditors, may cause some other sellers to take precipitous
action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or
arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower $2.9
billion level, which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally.
We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action
will be taken. The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is
not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether, only legislation
that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE.

The tone of the presentation, if we make one, will be low key, non
threatening, and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor
design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy, litigation and other
alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed,
leaving the energy sellers out in the cold.

If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be
associated with the message outlined above, then I propose that we give such
members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and
allowing us, if asked, to identify any such members that prefer not to be a
part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids
litigation and bankruptcy for SCE.  I understand that the LADWP and Coral
Power would like this approach adopted.

As I explained in my prior email, it has been suggested that the proposed
bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor
Day and before the Sept 14 adjournment.  That is why timing is important.
Those of you that have not responed, please respond.  Those of you that were
concerned that the message was unclear, please review this email and
consider or reconsider your positions, as the case may be.

As of right now, there are only 11 votes: 9 in favor and 2 against.  The
polls are still open so please let me know your position.

You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined
that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee
required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee.

"206 - Refund Order","Christi & Sarah --

Do we have to do something related to this?  Thanks.

Jim


Note also that in a separate development FERC
simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section
206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide.
What this means is that, although only three utilities are
mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC
will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes
to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30
companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to
determine if the commission believes they exert market
power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires
power providers with market-based sales authority to amend
their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with
open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission
determines that market manipulation has occurred.

All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent.

Bob (cc Dan):

On August 9th I sent a memo to Dan and Bob re: budget for the Pacific
Northwest hearing. This included a PNW budget of $87,300 through the end of
the hearing September 6th. I noted that we had already spent some time on
PNW issues, including a meeting in Washington, etc. These were outside the
$87K value.

Just as an update, and to avoid any surprises, I thought I would provide Bob
with an update. So far we have spent a total of 206 hours on the Pacific
Northwest issues, through yesterday night. Needless to say, much of this
went into drafting the numerous bits of testimony, plus the data analysis of
the gas/power forwards prices. I also ended up drafting testimony on some
other issues not originally contemplated, including ripple, etc.

On that basis, we have gone through $66,575 of the total budget. I just
wanted to make sure people were OK with this as we still have a very long 9
days left to go before the hearing concludes next Thursday...and I expect we
will be very busy the entire time.

At this point we dont have draft language and we dont have a settlement with language that allows us to push the way we can in Ohio.  My thought was to push for an investigation and see within that context how far we could go.  At a minimum, if a hearing were to be granted, I think we could end up improving the balancing rules for IP, CILCO, etc.  Com Ed has the most favorable provisions and could end up being the model.  In my discussions with Jeff Merola and Rogers Herndon, they can work with this however it is not optimal.  They need to do a transaction in order to figure out where the bugs are.

Subject:	ICC- Balancing

On Friday, I participated in ICC Chairman Mathias' Roundtable on the state of competition in Illinois.  One of the questions he asked was what the ICC could do to improve competition in Illinois.  I commented that the ICC could commence an investigation on the balancing rules of the various utilities, having pointed out the problem's with ComEd's and the fact that the other utilities are even worse.  He expressed concern over ICC jurisdiction and opined that to the extent that it impacts retail transactions and adversely affects retail competition, the ICC is within its jurisdiction to order the utilities to file an amended OATT before FERC for FERC's approval.  I plan to follow-up with a letter to him and all the Commissioners and would like feedback as to how hard I should push on this.  Should the ICC look into balancing (to which I give a less than 50% probability) we would have to be prepared to participate.  I think it would be highly worth the effort, especially as far as Illinois Power is concerned, however, I would like some feedback as to your views in order to guage how hard to push this.

Thanks,
Janine

Do you have a listing of all bonds that EES (and its affiliates) has in place for retail marketing, including wholesale ISOs? Speaking with Gloria, we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs.  Rebecca Fite keeps bond information required in the State licensing processing.  The place that I think that is missing is Wholesale Service providers (e.g., ISOs).

I think that we need to expand this idea of Bonding to ""Financial Guarantees"" including with Utilities, States, and Wholesale Service Providers.

Maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from EES active markets and determine what is needed in each locale?

I still think that  we would want to have a single person responsible for reporting all potential situations that may cause a default /bad pr situation and  notify the EES office of the chairman  in a manner that would allow plenty of opportunity to cure ( i.e., before it is a crisis).  Gloria and Denise, will you take that on?

Subject:	Bond Requirement

Gloria -

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers

Jim,

I was not aware EPSA was filing an intervention to the WestConnect tariff.  After a cursory review of the attachment however, it very much lines up with what I have sent to Ray and Steve.  We focus a bit more on the lack of definition of a congestion management plan as well as hit on ""hints"" of where WestConnect is probably going to stay (contract path) based upon some clues in the filing.  We focus more on existing contracts (lack of conversion) as well as additional comments on the planning appendix.  They hit just about every other point we cover, independence, or lack thereof being the key.

Thanks,

Dave

      Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
           Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
           Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
           Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: November 12, 2001

RE: EPSA Draft Motion to Intervene and Protest in the
      WestConnect RTO filing
?			Filing due November 15th
?
Attached is EPSA's motion to intervene and protest in the WestConnect RTO filing (Docket Nos. EL02-9-000 and RT02-1-000).  The draft primarily focuses on independence and governance issues, however also highlights the WestConnect tariff, congestion management, market monitoring, pricing and interconnection aspects of the filing.  For example, the draft argues that the participating transmission owners retain too much authority over RTO operations, that FERC should require all RTO load to take service under the WestConnect tariff, and that WestConnect should adopt the GridFlorida market monitoring plan.

Interventions are due to FERC on Thursday, November 15th.  Please have any edits or comments to Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org by noon on Wednesday, November 14th.   We'll also discuss the draft on this week's Regulatory Affairs conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 3:30 P.M. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  If you have further questions or comments, please contact Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org or 202-628-8200.

Jim, I spoke with Mike Alexander, PG&E, last night.  Their legal team met yesterday afternoon regarding our request.   He expects we will receive a response from Peter Ouberg today or tomorrow.  They are saying that the credits are listed as part of Schedule F of their bankruptcy filing and cannot be reinstated.  Mike also commented that they do not view this as a billing dispute and will refer us to Rule 22, Section L. 2. e &f, ESP responsibilities.

Janet Covington, SCE, said their legal and credit team are crafting a response.  She did not have a feel for how SCE will view our request.  I think it might be a good time to contact Steve Kean.

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject: FW: FERC grants SMD clarification requested by ISO-NE




Attached is the much anticipated order granting clarification of the Commission's order on the SMD filing.  The heart of this order states that when the FERC refused to act on the SMD filings, its action:

was not intended to stop ISO-NE's or any other parties' efforts that might further the objectives of developing and implementing a regional market in the Northeast.  The Commission has already identified many aspects of such a market that it expects to see:  e.g., congestion management through locational marginal pricing, and day ahead and real time markets.  These elements are likewise present in SMD.  It thus was not the intention of the Commission that parties should stop work altogether.  Continuation of ISO-NE's efforts at developing the software and related products necessary to implement SMD would, in fact, be a positive step toward ultimately developing a single Northeastern market.  We note, however, that as it continues with the development of SMD, ISO-NE should be mindful of the ultimate goal of a single Northeastern market design.  We thus urge ISO-NE to continue with development of SMD in every aspect, including software, in a sufficiently flexible manner so that any products developed for SMD may be readily adaptable to whatever market design is ultimately proposed for the Northeastern RTO.

Jim,
 This is what I have for you today (8/10).  It is not as complete as I would have liked at this point.  I am trying to find some new places to look for this info.  If you have any ideas on other contacts I can check, I will call them ASAP.  If you have some new ideas, I can work on this throughout the weekend.  Just let me know.

1. Listing of who is owed how much in California
	Ray Alvarez - in DC (202-466-9170)
Explained that the best figure anyone has right now is the conglomerate 8.9 million that CAISO put together.  Clearly not everyone agrees with this summation, but Ray believes that CA will still fight for this figure.  They have not made public how they derived this information therefore it is not very helpful.  However, the FERC is beginning a hearing on Monday, 8-13, to find out the exact numbers, per company that we are after.  We should have an estimate on when we can get the reported numbers on Monday afternoon. Numbers will most likely be brought up in the opening, so we should know in a few days.
He also suggested that the following is a good list of all groups who have a major interest in the California situation.  It is derived from FERC docket #EL00-95.  

 << File: CA Players.doc >> 
2. Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.
 We have a good list from the CA State Controller's office.  We know size of forward contracts, but not overall positions.  *See attached file of ""Summary of DWR Long-Term Energy Contracts As of 7/2/01""

 << File: DWR contracts.pdf >> 
3. Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on the lists.
4. Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.
Linda Guinn, in legal, said she would gather some information, regarding the preliminary creditors involved in the PG&E bankruptcy as soon as she could. (Richard Sanders is on vacation).  I was unable to reach Lisa Melencamp. 
Linda explained to me that a list of defendants may be rather lengthy, and that if we could be more specific in our search request it will help her.
Neither Bill Bradford nor Mike Tribolet have a creditors list available.  I am currently searching the SEC filings (that are made public on the web) for some of the larger Corps, such as PG&E and SoCal Edison.

Subject: New Report on Lessons from California
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;	boundary=""=====================_640249==_.ALT""

Dear Colleague,
The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.
Here is a summary of the paper:
        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.
        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry. 
        Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.
        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:  
Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.  
Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.  
Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).  
Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.  
Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.  
Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.  
Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).  

        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options. 
        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time. 
        Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices. 
        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Subject:	California Refund Proceeding--Got some exhibits to prepare--Confidential Atty Client Work Product

I met with Gary Fergus and we determined the  need to prepare affidavits and/or exhibits as part of our August 15th showing in the Califronia refund case. 

Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness).

 I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits:

Witness designations are preliminary.

1. EPMI's receivables from ISO/PX
What it shows:  ISO owes us $41.5 million and the PX $9.1 million plus any claims we want to make w.r.t. letters of credit with the PX
Sponsor: Tracy Ngo (PX data) and Murray O'Neil (ISO data)  (Tracy has agreed to prepare the exhibit but wants support from Murray's group on the ISO numbers.) 

2. EPMI's ""receivables"" from ISO for the underscheduling penalty
What it shows:  ISO has yet to actually implement the underscheduling penalty but has been tracking it.  According to information provided Chris Stockly, EPMI would receive $30 million of penalty revenues 
Sponsor:  Chris Stokley or Murray O'Neil

3. Enron's PX credit receivables
What it shows:  PG&E and SCE collectively owe EES $500 million
Sponsor: Steve Swain or ??

No, I don't know anything about it.  What state is the PUC hearing in?  If Texas, then Jean Ryall's group would cover.  If LA, ARK, etc., then Janine Migden's group would cover.  The coordination comes from our group keeping Jean and Janine in the loop on the wholesale issues and they are to let us know about retail where necessary.  Thanks.

Susan, Chirsti

Question: Who in our group deals with the interfaces between Wholesale Competition (E.g. RTO, SPP) and Retail Competition?

I am asking because Jean Ryall called me asking about our involvement in an upcoming PUC hearing (this coming Friday), where some SPP members have filed a petition requesting further delays in retail competition in light of the ongong discussions on RTOs.

I asked Jean to send more information. There is nothing on the SPP website alluding to this hearing. Do you know anything about it?

"RE: ComEd wants to limit power purchase option","Sounds reasonable.  Would the same be true about the DST case?  If we lose, without the PPO what do we have?

First, I think the gig may soon be over since at least one commissioner is catching on to our chirade.  Second, since that's not a particularly helpful observation, I think we ought to be very blunt that the reason we had to play the chirade is that the PPO price is far and away better than anything we can match and that it is a subsidized price because it does not explicitly recognize ancillary service, imbalance, and retailer costs except for the pittances we got added in the case a year ago.  
So we can ask that the same subsidies be maintained for customers wo have chosen thusfar (grandfathered, in other words).  Going forward, it seems that elimination of the PPO would be helpful to market development so it's hard to argue against that.  So maybe we offer a trade - support for elimination of PPO in exchange for grandfathered treatment of existing contracts we have on PPO.

Attached is an article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune this morning
regarding Edison's presentation to yesterday's ICC Electric Policy Committee
Meeting that we thought you would find to be of interest.


From the Chicago Tribune
ComEd wants to limit power purchase option
By Melita Marie Garza
Tribune staff reporter

October 17, 2001

Commonwealth Edison Co. on Tuesday proposed weaning its largest commercial
and industrial customers from a power purchase plan that the company asserts
stifles competition in the state's emerging market for electricity.

Under the proposal, the utility would differentiate between industrial
customers that use less than 400 kilowatts of electricity at any given
moment and those that use more, Pamela Strobel, ComEd's chairman, told the
Illinois Commerce Commission. A standard Jewel or Dominick's grocery store
uses about 400 kilowatts of electricity at a given moment, Strobel said.

Under deregulation, corporate customers have three options: Stay with
ComEd's standard regulated electricity service based on rates set in 1996,
pick an alternative supplier or opt for ComEd's so-called Power Purchase
Option.

Customers who pick the last option get ComEd's market rate but are allowed
to choose ComEd competitors as their primary power suppliers.

ComEd's proposal would bar its largest customers from that option, which the
utility says has stymied deregulation because it allows competing suppliers
to merely resell the power that ComEd produced.

""So long as the utility is providing this option, real competitive markets
won't work,"" said Arlene Juracek, ComEd's vice president for regulatory and
strategic services. ""Some suppliers have taken the easy way out by telling
their customers to sign up for the plan.""

Terry Harvill, an ICC member, agreed. ""There was an unintended problem ...
rather than alternative suppliers coming into Illinois with diverse sources
of energy, essentially you have them just taking power from ComEd and
reselling it to customers,"" Harvill said.

Specifically, ComEd proposes to limit the Power Purchase Option to
non-residential customers paying competitive transition charges, effective
June 2002. The transition charges cover costs incurred by the utility prior
to deregulation.

""I think it's a step in the right direction, but the details remain to be
worked out,"" Harvill said. He noted that companies still would have the
option to fall back on ComEd's traditional regulated plan.

But Marty Cohen, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, was
skeptical.

""There are certain inherent conflicts in the way that Edison sees the world
because they are a subsidiary of a much larger company--Exelon--which is, in
fact, the largest producer and seller of electricity in this market,"" Cohen
said.

""So you have ComEd on the one hand being the largest buyer of electricity,
and you have Exelon, its parent company, being the largest seller of
electricity. This proposal doesn't address that issue.""
