"EOL Crude Oil Data","I must apologize regarding the lateness of this e-mail. I sent the Excel file with crude oil data as an e-mail attachment earlier this afternoon, and when I checked my mail just now, I discovered that it had been rejected because of its size.

I have reduced the amount of data somewhat by using the following limitations: WTI Crude Oil swap transactions only, starting from January 1, 2001, with delivery in the USA. This allowed me to get rid of some unnecessary fields. Please note that there are no calendar spread options or basis options included in the data, and, as this is from Clayton's database, it does not include failed trades or limit-order trades.

The Excel file (""Crude Data"") can be found in:

O:\_Dropbox\Tom Barkley

I have started looking at the data already, but it does not seem possible to plot all 24000+ points in one Excel chart. I hope this helps.

Tom

"2002 Research support for EAM","Dear Vince & Ozzie:

For the Research support of the EAM organization, we were planning till recently for a team of 4 to 5 people for 2002. Over the last four to five months, requests for our support have gone up, primarily for consumption risk, physical options and value-at-risk. 

However, given the challenges we are facing now, I would like to reduce the Research staff for EAM to a core team of 3 people with a budget allocation of roughly $750,000. Please note that this includes not only the salaries and bonuses, but also the overhead and other expenses as well. The breakdown of the support levels for individual groups (with agreement from the group heads) is as follows:

EAM Fundamentals (Steve Meyers)	0.4 FTE
		Curve and Model Development Group (Mauricio Quintana)
		Project Valuation Group (Steve Kromer)
DSM Desk	0.6 FTE
		Pricing and Risk Premiums (Ravi Duggirala)
DSM VAR and risk controls (Vladi Gorny)	0.5 FTE
Consumption/SiteProfile Desk (Mallik AVS)	1.25FTE
		Consumption Premium Models 
		Support for SiteProfile Issues (load shaping, asset profiling, etc.)
	Other Short Term Requests	0.25FTE
	(Examples from last year: Insurance Model for Rick Jones, Business Assurance data analysis, etc.)

I would really appreciate if both of you can approve or provide your feedback on this. 

Thanks,
Krishna

Natural Gas Futures Rally on Late Short-Covering


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX powered upward
yesterday, driven by locals short-covering near the close. It ran as high
as $2.08 per MMBtu before expiring up $0.098 at $2.006 per MMBtu, but
still down 23% from when it began as the prompt month at $2.619 per MMBtu.
The March contract rose $0.083 to $2.067 per MMBtu. The expiration was the
lowest since October's $1.83 finish in late September. And prospects
remain bearish for the new prompt March contract, surrounded by bearish
technical and fundamental signals. Look for support at $1.76-$1.80. Mild
weather across much of the nation and the huge storage excess sent prices
mainly downward all month. Traders saw funds covering short positions
during the morning, with trading houses covering in the early afternoon.
Locals, which were short near the close, started buying. The market still
carries a huge $0.965 forward carry between the February-March contract
and January 2003. The larger that forward carry, the more bearish the
market can be. Look for more short-covering before selling brings the
market back down. The AGA will release its weekly  storage report this
afternoon. Expect a withdrawal of about 110 - 120 Bcf. The 5-year average
for the week is 150 Bcf.  A year ago there was a draw of 128 Bcf.
Yesterday's estimated volume was 127,000 contacts, with 47,000 of those
hedge or spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to down $0.05 yesterday as cold weather moves
back into the Midwest. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub
lost $0.05 to $1.97 per MMBtu.

Merrill Lynch Top Executives Involved in Enron Partnership

   A report that Merrill Lynch executives invested in a limited
partnership, LJM2, which was used by Enron to inflate earnings and hide
debt from shareholders, has sent the investment company scurrying to deny
any wrongdoing. Merrill Lynch invited managing directors and senior
executives to invest in the partnerships after it helped Enron raise $349
million for the partnership from pension funds and other institutional
investors. Critics say that some investment banks may have been less
stringent in their scrutiny of Enron because senior executives were doing
business with it and had a vested interest in its profits, raising
questions about conflict of interest. The investments may be subject to
congressional examination after the House Energy and Commerce Committee
subpoenaed Enron's partnership records, including the identities of
investors. Enron has revealed that its former CFO made $30 million from 2
partnerships, including LJM2. Merrill Lynch says that the investment
partnership is in line with common industry practices. Merrill Lynch
claims that it was offered to qualified external as well as internal
investors, which would not be a conflict of interest.

CFTC Says No Enron Market Manipulation

    Enron did not try to engage in market manipulation at any futures
exchange, according to testimony before the Senate Energy Committee by the
chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Both the CFTC
chairman and the FERC chairman said they did not see a need for new
federal market regulation because of Enron. FERC has found no substantial
spillover effects into the energy markets because of Enron. In the
aftermath of Enron's collapse, prices and energy markets remained stable,
with neither electric nor natural gas deliveries being disrupted.

Enron Names Bankruptcy Specialist as Interim CEO


    Enron has named Stephen Cooper, managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, as
interim chief executive officer and chief restructuring officer. Enron
also named Jeff McMahon as president and chief operating officer and Ray
Bowen as CFO. Cooper, McMahon and Bowen will take on the task of trying to
raise Enron from the ashes after its collapse. Coopers firm specializes in
resurrecting bankrupt companies. Cooper is currently handling the
bankruptcy reorganization of Greyhound Lines parent Laidlaw Inc, but
Laidlaw's restructuring is almost complete. Industry experts say that
Cooper must now balance the demands of the bankruptcy with running the
remaining businesses and handling the lawsuits and investigations related
to Enron's collapse. The new CEO says that with more than 19,000 employees
worldwide, Enron has real businesses with real value. He said that his
team will work closely with the Board of Directors, management and the
creditors' committee to develop a reorganization plan to maximize value
for the company's shareholders. He has already begun working for Enron.
Greg Whalley, who had been president and CEO resigned to take a position
with UBS Warburg, which acquired Enron's energy trading unit 2 weeks ago.
Enron has also agreed to sell businesses and long-term contracts for more
than $520 million and relinquished control of Northern Natural Pipeline to
Dynegy. Additionally, it plans to sell Portland General Electric to
Northwest Natural Gas for about $3 billion. There has been no word of when
the Board of Directors will name a new chairman to replace Ken Lay.

Senate Committee Examines Enron's Impact on Energy Markets


     Conventional futures exchanges like the NYMEX are entirely regulated
by the CFTC. But the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, passed
by Congress after a big lobbying effort by Enron, removed over-the-counter
and some on-line energy transactions from CFTC control. Those exempted
markets made up the bulk of Enron's trading operations. The CFTC is
working with the White House on auditing and accounting standards, and the
combination of its market supervisory functions under one agency division.
Although at least 8 other congressional probes are being conducted into
the financial and accounting facets of Enron's demise, the Senate Energy
Committee's authority is limited to the effects of Enron's meltdown on
energy markets and consumers. Legislators at the hearing saw little impact
from Enron on US energy markets. Some on the panel referred to it as
business failure, not an energy market failure. Even though the chairman
of the NYMEX has not call for any greater regulation of over-the-counter
markets, he has called on regulators to treat on-line exchanges and
traditional pit-based ones equally.

Derivatives at Root of Enron Collapse


    Enron's extensive use of derivatives, not just its accounting
practices, lie at the root of its fall into bankruptcy. Enron had used
profits from its derivatives trading operation, which was little
understood by investors, to mask losses in its more visible businesses
even as some of its employees may have been fraudulently manipulating
those profits. Enron reaped huge profits from derivatives.  But it lost
billions on most everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic
bandwidth, retail natural gas and power, water systems and technology
stocks, but used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses.
Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to
underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds.
They are used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. Enron's use of
derivatives both outside and inside the company can likely be directly
linked to its collapse. On the outside, they were used to create the
company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial
partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals
went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and
a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive
into bankruptcy. But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the
outside special purpose vehicles. It appears that some Enron employees
used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false
profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded.

Williams' Shares Plunge 22% on Telecom Debt


    Shares of Williams tumbled 22% yesterday after it reported it may have
up to $2.4 billion in costs from Williams Communications which was spun
off last April. Williams may have to pay $1.4 billion in Williams
Communications debt if its credit rating falls below investment grade. It
also may owe $750 million in Williams Communications fiber optic-network
leases and $250 million in other expenses. Shares of Williams
Communications dropped 80% last year as growth evaporated with the dot.com
collapse. In the past month, Williams sold securities and cut capital
spending to strengthen its balance sheet amid increased scrutiny by
credit-rating agencies in the wake of Enron's collapse. It also plans to
sell assets to maintain the all-important investment-grade debt rating.
Because of the debt review, Williams delayed reporting 4th quarter results
that had been scheduled for release yesterday. The review will have no
direct impact on Williams Communications business, the company said in a
statement. However, the stock market is in the process of evaluating the
situation and is assuming the worst. Williams' shares fell $5.3, to $18.78
yesterday. Its 7.75% coupon maturing in 2031 fell about $42 to $921 per
$1,000 face value from $963. That pushed the yield up to 8.48% from 8.08%.
Williams's convertible preferred stock, which was sold this month at $25,
tumbled $3.93 to $21.65 per share. Enron had $724 million in losses from
telecommunications in the 3rd quarter. Global Crossing filed for
bankruptcy protection Monday after it accumulated $12 billion in debt it
was unable to repay because of falling sales. Shares Williams
Communications fell $0.29 to $1.34 yesterday.

Subject:	Wharton

Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an ""Enron brain drain"" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).   

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

Christie,

Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the ""From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop"" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites
for your convenience:

In light of the recent misstep with MIT, do you think we should try to send a senior Enron rep to the Sloan Leadership conference on October 27?  Vince Kaminski is probably the right person to attend.

Tom,
Before I left my summer internship at Enron, I sent you a message regarding
the Sloan Leadership Conference (see below).  The conference will be held on
Saturday, October 27.  We would like to invite you to be on the Finance
panel.  I can also work with you if you want to be involved in other aspects
of the conference. It would be great if you could offer the conference
participants your unique experiences in bringing new products to market.  I
think you have the perfect background for this panel, and I am very excited
about the opportunity to have you on the panel.  I have included the thesis
statement for the finance panel below.

Also, I have not heard back from HR about their interest in the conference.
I think this is a great opportunity for Enron to spread its message to a
targeted audience.  The sponsor memo is attached.  If you would be
interested in sponsoring this conference, please let me know as soon as
possible.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  I will call
you as soon as I can concerning the conference.

Thanks,

FINANCE PANEL THESIS
The finance panel will focus on innovation in finance, specifically in
accessing capital, valuation techniques, new product development, and
product distribution.  From a corporate perspective the focus will be on
innovative ways of both accessing capital, given the recent scarcity in the
traditional equities market, and valuing businesses.  From a financial
institutions perspective the focus will be on new products and new
distribution channels.  Beyond addressing the issues faced by their
companies, the panelists can/should also discuss specific leadership
strategies financial managers need to employ in difficult times.

Mr. Lemmons,
When we met with you regarding the Enron/MIT Sloan relationship, you
mentioned
that Enron was interested in narrowing the search for talent by targeting
specific programs at schools that are more in line with Enron's goals.  We
would
like to present 2 programs at MIT Sloan that would be ideal for Enron and
will
produce a more effective recruiting approach.  The two programs are the MIT
Sloan Leadership Conference (which will feature a ""Finance and Innovation""
panel) and the brand new Energy & Environmental Finance Club.

MIT SLOAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
(See attached file: Sponsor_Memo.doc)(Sponsor Memo is Attached)

The conference is a student-led initiative that has drawn successful leaders
from various industries around the world.  We recognize that leadership is
not
something that can be taught in the course of one day.  However, we hope to
draw
upon the practical experiences of some of today's most recognized leaders to
help guide us toward our own personal leadership styles, and to educate us
about
the kinds of issues that we may face as leaders ourselves in the future.

This year's Conference, ""Critical Choices: Defining Moments of Leadership"",
addresses the difficult decisions that leaders face in an evolving
environment,
and the development of organizational leadership to successfully manage
these
decisions.   The conference will feature Ben Zander, the conductor of the
Boston
Philharmonic.  He performs around the world, teaches at the New England
Conservatory, and speaks to corporations and other organizations on
leadership.
Furthermore, several panels focusing on leadership in specific industries
will
be held.  The finance panel will focus on ""Finance and Innovation"", and will
discuss the leadership challenges of bringing innovation to an industry that
has
been relatively status quo.

We can talk to him about the feasibility study.
The man problem is managing too many partners

Vince,

Mary Nordstorm in RAC forwarded me this message from her friend
who is a consultant. 

I think it does not hurt us if we prob his algorithm without 
telling him anything.

Over the past year, I've been doing a lot of work to one of the largest
Chicago market making firms in equity options. The project has to do with
the ""Market Microstructure"".

With high degree of accuracy we can predict where the stock price is going
to go in the next 15 seconds to 60 seconds. This technique can NOT be used
to predict where the stock will be tomorrow or even in the next hour. As
these are only short term predictions, the changes in the stock are usually
small. Therefore, this technique is of no use to day traders. However,
suppose you need to buy stocks anyway. For example, if you need to delta
hedge an option position and buy some stock, the model might tell you to
wait a few minutes and save a few pennies.  Every time the stock moves and
the trader has to modify the position, they consult our model and decide on
their action: buy now or wait. Of course, this also works for ""sell now or
wait"". Indeed, we found out that they save about 3-4 cents per stock trade.
The market makers typically trade hundreds of millions of stocks a year so
this is quite interesting to them.

We also have a project with one of the major US banks to apply this to
foreign currency (forex) markets.

At this stage, it would be interesting to adapt this project to other
markets. For example crude oil comes to mind. The project involves two
stages:
a) A feasibility study to check if this is possible to do.
b) Building a real time system to give signals to the traders.

I think we can do step (a) independently without any commitment on your
part.  We would then apply our models and see if we can come up with
anything interesting. We have access to ""tick data"" through a commercial
service called ""e-signal"". I believe that it is reasonably good. If you have
access to better tick data then it would be helpful for us to obtain several
days (perhaps two weeks) of tick data (bids, asks and trades which are time
stamped).

   How are you?
   The process for starting summer work is going well,
   and there will be no problem we start work
   on May 30.
   I got a place to live, and reserved a flight.
   I'm going to leave for Houston on May 29
   (expected time to arrival is around noon)
   I am very much excited to have opportunity
   to join the project making an exchange platform.

   I think it's time I'd better remind you
   of scheduling a meeting with me,
   sometime on May 30.

   I hope you let me know what to to
   after I arrive at Houston.
   And please let me know if you have anything
   you think I prepare, to get better outcome
   from the summer work.
   If you give me a brief on the work,
   it would be a great help for me to decide
   which material I should carry from here to Houston.

   I look forward to the date we meet,
   Warm regards,

 I believe the inception document for automating VaR processes you prepared in April already covers the requirements David has listed with minimal changes. Please review and comment as needed.

Subject:	Factor Loadings Process

As an FYI for those not already in the loop, new factors for VaR have not been implemented since some time in April, and it seems the process of administering them is foggy.

So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings: 


 << File: FactorLoadingProcess.doc >> 

Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:

Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations;
Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;

For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).

Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.

Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

Attached you will find the cash data that I have been using to derive my graphs.

In terms of the method I used to derive the average of $10 million/day, I used the net cash inflows for September and the net cash outflows for October and calculated an average based upon 41 business days.  The average came out to be $6.22 million/day and I then grossed it up a bit to be $10 million even.

"Falling Gas Prices Trigger Active Rig Count Decline - CERA Decision Brief","
Title: Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2808;


***********************************************************************

FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINE

The economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling
gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices
briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068
gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by
November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers' drilling plans for the
2002 budget year are already being curtailed.

*  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the
United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day
of lost production.

*  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop
in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive
capacity.

*  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy
recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.

A stochastic programming application that optimally trades power and operates a portfolio of generators to satisfy load commitment contracts, with uncertainties in power prices, fuel prices, and loads. Under transmission constraints, we can trade some amount of power with the market at bid-ask market prices. In this model, we also take into account the minimum up time and minimum downtime constraints as well as the startup costs.

"RE: Job posting","Dear Vince,

I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he
interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am
wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after the
graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me any
longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment and
all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired
at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not quite
what I expected.

Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting
position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact
with the right people? I would really appreciate it.

Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).
Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Helen Demianenko.

"Data for Moody's RiskCalc","Iris

From the initial work that I Ben and I have done, data availability for the Moody's model is relatively good for European companies. However, there are problems for certain jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands) where reporting requirements are low. Also, all newly established entities with no accounts cannot be priced.

You may be aware that S&P has a similar model. You can find the description at www.creditmodel.com. We met with S&P earlier this morning and they will give us logins that I will forward to you. I have not looked at the details, but it appears to me that the Moody's model could be more relevant for our purposes as the S&P model is calibrated of companies that S&P has rated, whereas Moody's has actually got data not only retsricted to the firms they rate. Moreover, the S&P threshold USD 100m) is very high.

For US counterparties, there may be a problem as private US firms do not need to publish accounts. In any case, quality data is probably one of the most important issues to be resolved going ahead, and this is likely to define what companies we will be able to price and influence model selection. Therefore when you (or someone else) examines potential data sources/vendors please keep Eric Kirkpatrick and Mike Mumford in the loop to ensure full co-ordination

Subject:	Data for Moody's RiskCalc 

Craig and Kim,

	As you know,  I have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to Moody's RiskCalc.

	You wanted to know if it makes sense for Enron to purchase RiskCalc.

	Well, after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today's 2-hour Moody's presentation, it is necessary for us to have information about Enron's counterparties to move to the next step with RiskCalc.

	We have obtained some information on Enron's European counterparties from our colleagues in the London office.

	We need for you and/or your colleagues in the Houston office to supply us with a list of Enron's North American counterparties.  

	More specifically, to evaluate Moody's RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enron's North American (private firm) counterparties:

		
 	
Fiscal Year
The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year's (1999) inflation level. In general this 'estimation error' will not cause any great problems, as size affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not). 

Cash & Equivalents
This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities. 

Inventory
Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, insurance costs, and storage costs.

Current Assets
This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, marketable securities, and other current assets. 

Total Assets
Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, and investments and advances). Leave previous year's total assets blank for Australian companies. 

Current Liabilities
Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. 


Total Liabilities
This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest). 


Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior year's retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

Sales
This item consists of the industry segment's gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers. 

Cost of Goods Sold
Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

EBIT
Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income. 

Interest Expense
This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities. 


Net Income
This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous year's net income blank for Australian companies. 



Extraordinary Items
Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous year's extraordinary items blank for Australian companies. 


Country
This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia. 


	We look forward to receiving this information for Enron's private firm North American counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the evaluation of RiskCalc.


Thanks,
Iris

"Thank You For Your Time and Hospitality","
Vincent....on behalf  of Toshiba Corporation, we wanted to thank you for the valuable time you spent  with us on Tuesday and also for the great Brennan's Lunch!
 
We hope you and your  team felt that the time was well spent and you found the Boltzmann concepts and  model to be both interesting and compelling.
 
We know that we  threw alot of very detailed information at you in a relatively small amount of  time and of course it will take some time to digest.
 
We're thinking that  the best way forward may be a small research or prototype project where Enron  and Toshiba may be able to jointly test, analyze and benchmark the application  of this concept -- to determine it's feasibility and potential business  benefit.  We are very interested in your thoughts about this  idea.
 
We have  attached the 2 briefings that were given for your use and internal distribution  as appropriate.  We have also attached other potentially useful information  (published papers, etc.) for your use as you attempt to better understand  the Boltzmann Model and underlying concepts.
 
Thanks again and we  look forward to the opportunity for mutually beneficial collaboration between  Toshiba's eSolutions Company and ENRON.
 
Sincerely,
 
Tom Murphy

"Briefing Ken Lay","Vince, 

I would like to respond to the discussion that we had today.  It probably would have been more accurate to characterize my work for Ken Lay as a ""briefing"" rather than as a ""speech"".  When I said I wrote a speech, I meant ""I prepared presentation material"" for him to use for his speaking engagement.  I thought that ""writing a speech"" and ""preparing a presentation"" is OK to use interchangeably in the English language. 

In my review I stated as an accomplishment, "" I worked with the Chairman of Enron, Ken Lay, briefing him on President Bush's tax proposals helping him prepare for a trip to the White House along with Steve Kean.""   However, I think the results are the same.  Ken Lay and Steve Kean were pleased with our contribution.  To me this was an accomplishment not only for me, but our group, and I would hope The Reseach Department.  

For you to say that my misuse of the English language ""undermines my credibility"", however, is a bit strong and I do not agree.  I pride myself in is my honesty.

Subject: Price Dynamics and Risk Management in the Energy Markets

Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com
We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your
presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM
conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider
making a presentation at Aspen's corporate world conference Aspen World 2002
in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of
Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a
little strange making a ""cold-call"" in this manner, but I am reaching out in
the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain,
Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers.
AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or
application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and
activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and
integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been
cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing
activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology.
Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one
intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and
staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling
technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and
opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest
convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you
think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on
the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTech's core businesses.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Sincerely,
Skip Paules

Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling

This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties
and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on
the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include:
point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization
application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as
well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting,
supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading
models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What
developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to
take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level
where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain
optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk
and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged
strategies to achieve the desired goals.

Possible presentation topics will include:

*   Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling
*   Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time)
*   Robust control
*   Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications
*   Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets)
*   Flexible design and synthesis
*   Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand
*   General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk,
Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty

The application takes as input the name of a file containing a stocks
trading history. The first line of the file has the stocks symbol, the
second a human-readable description of each quotes fields (This comes
from the format used by Yahoo! Finance and is simply skipped by the
application), and the remaining lines are quotes, starting with the most
recent, in the form:

<day>-<month>-<year>,<open>,<high>,<low>,<close>,<volume>

Where,

<day> == Day of the month (1-31)
<month> == Three-letter abbreviation of the months name
<year> == Two-digit representation of the year
(The rest are self-explainatory)

Adapting the application to use different formats is trivial.


In its current form the analysis is quite simple. A stochasitic (fast or
slow, with abritrary periods) is computed from the stocks data (see
below for a more detailed description). Next, the stock data searched
for Japanese Candlestick patterns (see below).

The actual analysis consists of simulating several years of trading
(here ten years). Each is stochastic and candlestick data is examined.
If the days candlestick is a hammer and the %k is above a pre-defined
value, a buy signal is triggered. Likewise, if the days candlestick is a
hanging man and the %k is below a second pre-defined value, a sell
signal is triggered.
When simulating a buy, a long position of a constant number of shares is
opened if long positions already exist or if no positions exist. If
there are open short positions, each of these is closed. Likewise, when
simulating a sell, a short position of the same constant number of
shares is opened if short positions already exist or if no positions
exist. If there are open long positions, each of these is closed.
When closing a position, the rate-of-return and annualize rate-of-return
are calculated. For both long and short positions:

                           sale cost - purchase cost
                     RoR = -------------------------
                                purchase cost
(a better method is needed for shorts)

and,
                                               365
                                      --------------------
                                      Duration of Position
          Annualized RoR = (RoR + 1.0)                     - 1.0

Stochastics:
            (Todays Close - Lowest Low for kN Periods)
%k = ---------------------------------------------------------
     Highest High for kN Periods - Lowest Low for kN Periods)
%p = Simple Moving Average of %k for pN Periods

     (Where the lowest low is chosen from amongst the lows
      field and the highest high is chosen from amongst the
      high field.)

This is a fast-stochastic. When computing a slow stochastic, %k is
replaced with its 3-day Simple Moving Average. %p is then calculated
from this value.


Japanese Candlesticks:
The application currently searches the data for the Hanging Man and
Hammer patterns. A Hanging Man is defined as very short top-shadow,
medium body, and long bottom-shadow. The ratios are adjustable. A Hammer
is a Hanging Man where the days close is higher than the open.

"Resume of a 2nd year Rice MBA - Chris Neale","Vince,

I talked to Chris last week during a recruiting event that Analyst and Associate pool hosted at Rice.
He was very interested in the kinds of projects that our group is working on.  Also, he has had an 
extensive experience in the Energy industry.
I am attaching his resume.  He has one more year left in school, but If you are interested, I could 
invite him over to talk to our group members, and get a better feel for the Enron Research environment.

Jason,

I enjoyed our discussions last Thursday....much more interesting that the usual partio-MBA schmooze stuff.  I would very much like to talk to your Director about opportunities at Enron.  To be honest, I am approaching Enron from several different points in order to pinpoint the area that best suits my abilities and sense of direction (kind of mirroring the internal process that you would use to move between groups within Enron).  As Enron is the only large corporation that I am seriously considering, talks with people such as yourself are invaluable in helping me find areas of commonality between the company's and my own goals.  Makes for a realistic set of expectations on both sides.

My resume is attached in Word format, but sending emails from home via the Rice server sometimes buggers the attachments.  If you can't open the document, let me know and I will send another copy both from my Roadrunner address as well as directly from school.

Thanks for the help.

"UT MBA Energy Finance Practicum Sponsorship","
Mr. Kaminski- 
I am an officer in the Energy Finance Group in the University of Texas MBA program, and I am in charge of coordinating our Energy Finance Practicum Program.  I would like to know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring one or more student teams in an energy finance practicum next semester.  I have attached a document with a description of the program, and details on what the level of commitment is for a sponsor (no financial commitment is required).  Sponsorships can only be given by the eight trustees of CEFER (the Center for Energy Finance Education & Research).  Dr. Ronn serves as a faculty advisor for each team.
Lexi Elliott suggested that you and Traci would be the appropriate people to contact for such a request.  Could you let me know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring a team next semester, and who my point of contact should be in the event that you would like to participate?  Feel free to contact me if you would like some more details on the program.
Thanks, 
Stephen Jensen

"SEC depostion","Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Condolences for the turbulent times Enron is going through.

We remain excited and optimistic about the possibilities of a joint project.
We realize that you and Vince may have limited bandwidth in the immediate
future, but when you have time we hope you will consider the draft proposal
we sent Vince.  We are still fully behind it.

Yours truly,

"RE: E-mail Retention","Britt,

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Vince

"job and my resume","Dear Director Vince Kaminsky,

I am Alex Yu, an MBA student at Rice University. Peter
Veruki, Executive Director of Career Planning and
Admissions, told me that he and Dean Gilbert Whitaker
had breakfast with you today, and that you might be
interested in hiring a summer intern or part-time
helper.

I have received a Ph.D. in Finance, MS in Accounting,
and MS and BS in Computer Science. In the course of my
studies, I have learned a great deal about finance,
mathematics, and computer software. I am very
interested in working in your program at Enron as a
summer intern or a part-time employee. My resume is
attached. Thank you for your consideration.

Best wishes,

Alex Guang Yu

"Re: Seminar at UH and at UT","Latha

Thanks for asking!

I'd like to leave San Francisco
non-stop to Houston on United
1556 at 11:10 am Jan 9, arriving 4:44pm,
then go to Austin on the late
afternoon of the 10th (for a seminar at UT),
then I need to get from Austin to San Francisco
on the evening of the 11th.
(There is a United flight 419 connecting through Denver
that leaves Austin at 5:30 pm,
connecting to United 409 out of Denver).
If there is a non-stop from Austin to
San Francisco or San Jose, that is even
better. (United, my preferred, does
not have a non-stop from Austin to
the Bay Area.)

The cost will be shared 50-50 with U. Texas,
if that's OK with you and them. I have copied
the organizer of the seminar there,
Professor Ron Kaniel.

Warm regards,

Darrell

"Enron Announcement","Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

"Factor Loadings Process","As an FYI for those not already in the loop, new factors for VaR have not been implemented since some time in April, and it seems the process of administering them is foggy.

So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings: 


 

Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:

Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations;
Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;

For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).

Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.

Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

we met a few week ago in Houston (I was the previous speaker on
modifications of Black-Scholes). As I mentioned, there were in your
talk several issues in which I am interested in.
I would be happy if you could send whatever related material you have:
slides, papers, etc.
At some point you mentioned also the possibility of sending some
time series. It would be very interesting to have them and apply our
pricing model to compare results.
Thank you very much,
Pablo Padilla

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

During this timely workshop, the partners in the ET program will learn from each other how to ratchet up their development productivity with innovative processes, organization designs and partnership arrangements. This is a networking event where partners are invited to share their experiences, insights and fresh management approaches to problems of mutual interest and concern.

Wharton Impact Conference - FRIDAY., Nov. 30, 2001
MANAGING KNOWLEDGE ASSETS:
CHANGING RULES AND EMERGING STRATEGIES
A Wharton Impact Conference sponsored by the William and Phyllis Mack Center on Technological Innovation
Co-Chaired by Mark Myers and Sid Winter, The Wharton School.
Knowledge may be the most important source of competitive advantage for a firm, but capturing the potential gains is a continuing challenge. Firms are filing patent applications at an unprecedented rate, while struggling to keep up with accelerating development cycles and shrinking lead times. Emerging technologies, changing legal interpretations and growing administrative burdens on the patent system are creating a new and unfamiliar context for the management of intellectual property. In response, firms are rethinking their strategies for realizing the rewards from their innovation.
The Mack Center at the Wharton School has assembled thought leaders from leading companies, government and academia to address issues such as the following:
- What strategies are firms using to create, protect and use their knowledge assets?
- Do mechanisms such as secrecy, control of complementary assetsand lead time play an important role as a substitute or supplement for patent protection?
- How is the U.S. patent and trademark office responding to the remarkable growth in patenting? Should they be protecting not only inventions but also ways of distributing and selling them? How should they deal with applications for patents on sequences of the human genome?
- In a world where technology is developed and employed globally, what are the prospects for international harmonization of intellectual property laws and practice?
- Are the patent office and the courts up to the task of creating and effectively enforcing clear intellectual property rights for emerging technologies?

"FW:","Vince, I want you to be aware of the discussions between RAC, IT and Research regarding using more than 7 factors for VAR.

I presented this idea couple of months ago. This will resolve the issue of capturing term-structure of correlations across different commodities which we have for our current VAR system and which we try to overcome by some patches (joint factors for selected groups of commodities). This will not increase the amount of calculations. In fact, just the opposite, this will
decrease the number of independent random variables which drive the model from approximately 1000 to about 60-40.

RAC did not pay much attention at that time. IT was busy with other things. This task was low priority.

Recently Naveen realized that his Convolution VAR will not work unless this idea of increasing the number of factors 
is implemented. With the present system he needs to deal with 1000 independent random variables and this is not feasible
for Convolution (or Analytical) VAR. 

We had a meeting regarding this issue last week and the consensus was finally to go ahead and increase the number of factors.
This is good news because we need this change in our system for the new ""Reliability VAR"" as well.

What worries me that Naveen presents this change now as part of the Convolution VAR. Not only it sounds now like his
idea, but, more importantly, I am afraid that when we need the same change (60 factors) for Reliability VAR we will
have to seek IT support again and compete with RAC for resources and we always loose in this battle. In addition, the 
Monte-Carlo is not going away so the right thing to do is to implement 60 factors in our production system. 

Regards,

Tanya

It is unneccessary to do action items which Convolution VaR is going to cover in its scope, and I am of the firm opinion that it is counterproductive to do things aiming at the Current MC framework when significant changes are to be done for Convolution.

These changes include Factor Loadings and correlations:  The factor analysis will be done jointly, with more factors in the Convolution framework.

Tanya and Frank,

The method will be first implemented for Convolution VaR.  To implement the method for current VaR (Monte Carlo method) needs many changes to existing programs, hence it will take longer.

The methodology is simple, but there are still some issues need to be confirmed/resolved, mostly related to data.

1. Data Alignment:  I understand that we will use fixed contract methodology from now on. We still need expiration rules to find prompt month for each primary curves.  Hence we still need make sure all expiration rules are set up correctly for each primary curve.

2. Data missing:  How do we handle data missing problem.  What should we do if there are some missing prices for some curves.  Do we ""recreate"" those missing data or do we eliminate all the prices on those missing dates?  If we ""recreate"", then how.  If we eliminate, then we may eliminating many good data because a few bad curves.

3. What will be the implication if we mix weekly curves with monthly curves together.  It seems OK, but we need make sure this is the case.

4. Do we still need factor look up for those inactive curves?  Or we don't care since we are using their true history.

There may be some other issues coming up when get into the design.

Regards,

Winston

we  have discussed the implementation with Winston and Naveen. I understand that how soon we start working on it
depends on the list of IT priorities. The methodology is clear. I wish it is implemented soon.

"Gas & PoweRisk 2001 Conference, November","
Dear Speaker at Gas & PoweRisk  2001!
 
I just wanted to give you a little update  on the developments of the preparations for the conference in November  in Paris. We have now just launched the second round of marketing for the event,  and bookings are coming in very nicely - it promises to be another exciting  conference, and even bigger and better than last year's!
 
For those who have not yet done so, I would like to  remind you of the possibility to send us the names of contacts  that you would like to get informed about your involvement in the  event, and we will then make sure that they receive a conference brochure. To  assure the highest level of confidentiality, you can also send these names to  our third party mailing house instead, and we will guarantee you that we only  use them for this one mailing.
 
Furthermore, I would like to remind you to book your  hotel room in Paris as soon as possible, should you not have  done so already. The conference hotel is filling up very quickly, and we will  only be able to hold rooms for you until the 28th September - so if you wish to  stay in the conference hotel, please fax the booking form directly to the hotel  as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.
 
Also please remember that we require a copy of your  presentation by Friday 12th October. Please make sure it gets  to us in time, as it can otherwise not be included in the conference  documentation pack, which in the past has been a constant source of complaints  from our delegates. Thank you for your cooperation!
 
I will attach the AV form and the marketing form -  please send them back as soon as possible if you have not done  so yet. This should not take more than 5 minutes of your time, but will help us  assure a smooth running on the day.
 
That's it for the moment - please contact either me or  my colleague Natasha Woolf should you have any further  questions!
 
I look forward to seeing you in Paris in a few  weeks' time!
 
Kind Regards,

"greetings from Charles","Hey, Vince:

How are you? I just want to thank your for all your
efforts during my application to Enron last year. Even
if it did not work out in the end, but I still
appreciate all your help.

I just started my new job at ""Allegheny Energy Global
Markets"" in New York city, the company is the trading
arm of Allegheny Energy, and used to be Merrill
Lynch's Energy Trading Group. I will be responsible
for structuring.

Again, thanks for the help, I look forward to talking
to you in those conferences in the future.

Sincerely,
Charles Shen

 Hi Vince,

        My name is Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon, I forwarded you the emails from Dr. Kloucek a few weeks ago.  I know that you must be very busy, but I was wondering if you would have time to meet with me sometime, perhaps over lunch.  See, I graduated from Rice (majored in Applied Math) a couple of years ago, and I am considering a PhD in Financial Math. I would like to work in idustry afterwards, not academia.  But I am wondering what type of jobs there are for people like that in companies like Enron, and I figured you would be a good person to ask.  So if you find yourself with a little free time I would be very grateful to be able to ask you a few questions.

Thanks!

 Maria Teresa

"ModReg for Argentina","Folks,
Here's some preliminary comments on the model we are using for Argentina.  Please correct me on any misunderstandings!

ModReg was written by consultants in Buenos Aires.  Documentation is available in Spanish only.  All data input is by means of text files, which require column orientated input, ie numbers must go into specific columns.  Detailed documentation has been provided specifying the data format for each file.

A weekly time step is used, with five load blocks per week, and a time horizon of one year, typically.  Each model run requires about 6 hours of processing.

ModReg is a modified version of the model used by the grid operator.  It is coded in Fortran and requires a CPLEX licence.  CPLEX is a powerful linear programming solver, developed by ILOG.  As the model is written in Fortran, the very good higher level interface to CPLEX is not available, so the code will have to access CPLEX at a lower level.

We have no documentation describing how the model algorithms.  Source code is not available at present.

ModReg appears to model around 30 busses and 71 lines.  Lines are characterised by from bus number, to bus number, maximum MW capacity in each direction, a percentage  loss factor, cost of transmission in each direction, and some other details.  Demand data is specified by week and load block for each bus.  Thermal plants have a heat rate and maintenance schedule specified, with the possibility of multiple fuels. I understand that hydro generation schedules for each historical inflow condition are an input to the model as they are calculated elsewhere.

From the above it appears that we have an unsatisfactory situation:
	ModReg is difficult to use
	we do not know in detail what the model does
	we do not have documentation describing the algorithm
 	because source code is not available, we are completely dependent on the consultants.

If Enron is to continue modeling Argentina, we should as a minimum have a model that we understand, is reasonably easy to use, and is documented.  A graphical user interface is really needed to make ModReg easier to use.  Documentation is of course essential.  We should not use a model developed by consultants without documentation.  These steps would enable us to have more confidence in model results, and shortens the learning curve to enable more people to use model.  

SDDP is likely to be a suitable replacement.  It would require reseroir inflow data rather than the calculated generations.  The regional loads etc could be modeled using the DC loadflow feature, with zero impedance lines.  Transmission losses in SDDP are a quadratic function of power flows, so some guesses would have to be made for line resistence values.  Setting up an SDDP model to represent all the aspects included in ModReg would be a time consuming job, that would require a good undertanding of the data for both models.  Some direct cut and paste of data from one model's files to the others will be possible with a suitable column oriented text editor.  However the end result would be a model with the desirable attributes of documention, GUI interface, and flexible output.

"Price Dynamics and Risk Management in the Energy Markets","Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com
We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your
presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM
conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider
making a presentation at Aspen's corporate world conference Aspen World 2002
in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of
Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a
little strange making a ""cold-call"" in this manner, but I am reaching out in
the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain,
Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers.
AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or
application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and
activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and
integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been
cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing
activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology.
Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one
intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and
staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling
technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and
opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest
convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you
think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on
the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTech's core businesses.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Sincerely,
Skip Paules

Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling

This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties
and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on
the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include:
point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization
application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as
well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting,
supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading
models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What
developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to
take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level
where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain
optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk
and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged
strategies to achieve the desired goals.

Possible presentation topics will include:

*	Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling
*	Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time)
*	Robust control
*	Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications
*	Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets)
*	Flexible design and synthesis
*	Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand
*	General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk,
Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty

>That interest stems from factors like ``the growth of the industry, which
moves at a very dynamic and aggressive pace,'' said
>James Peters, a spokesman for Mirant Corp. (NYSE:MIR - news), which
markets electricity and natural gas and owns power
>plants from North America to Asia.
>
>``The hours are better than investment banking and you get the same kind
of money,'' he added.
>
>Indeed, the power industry has undergone a sea change. Because of
deregulation, ``there are new management opportunities
>and new trading opportunities in the electricity and natural gas
industries,'' explained Stephen Brown, director of energy
>economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
>
>Deregulation enabled utilities to engage in the profitable business of
selling wholesale power across borders, opening the way
>for new opportunities that cater specifically to the strengths of people
with financial backgrounds.
>
>``The new merchant energy companies have built real dynamic cultures with
a commercial orientation and a market focus,'' said
>Ron Lumbra, an executive director who specializes in the merchant energy
field at recruitment firm Russell Reynolds.
>
>``It's a business where there's a huge component in marketing, trading and
structured transactions,'' he added.
>
>The MBA curriculum, with its emphasis on finance and risk management,
teaches skills that are transferable to the new needs of
>energy companies.
>
>``With their skill set, they can go into a number of different areas, like
strategic development, risk management, trading and
>anything on the commercial side of the business,'' noted Kim Pollard, a
recruiter at Richard, Wayne and Roberts.
>
>This new emphasis means that energy companies are beginning to look like
high-tech companies. ``There's a real demand for
>talent,'' Lumbra said. ``And these companies can compete with any company
in any industry.''
>
>A prime example of a new energy company is Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE - news),
which trades everything from electricity to
>broadband to weather derivatives. Other names are Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN -
news); El Paso Corp. (NYSE:EPG - news);
>and Duke Energy. Mirant, for instance, recruits students from Duke
University, University of Chicago and Rice University,
>among others.
>
>Exelon Corp. (NYSE:EXE - news) also stepped up its recruiting efforts
three years ago, according to Caryl Sabine, a
>consultant at Exelon Power Team, Exelon's wholesale trading and marketing
organization.
>
>During the recruiting season in September, Exelon will target business
schools at Harvard, the Wharton School of the University
>of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago, Cornell University and
Carnegie Mellon University, among others.
>
>New business school graduates aren't the only ones considering a career in
the energy sector either.
>
>Lumbra pointed out that at more senior levels there's also ''much more
willingness to discuss a move to the energy business,''
>from a cross-section of other industries, including professional services,
technology companies, industrial companies and
>financial services firms.
>
>That's partly because of the attention commanded by the energy crisis,
which has included rolling blackouts in California where
>deregulation failed. With millions and even billions of dollars at stake
in markets like this, companies are seeking seasoned
>executives.
>
>``Energy is not so much a take-for-granted kind of service anymore, where
you just flip a switch or pull up to the gas pump,''
>Lumbra said.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Meeting and Event Expenditure","
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

"Enron/Stanford Project","Hello Vince,

How are you? Hope all is well.

Eric tells me he had a very productive summer at Enron and was exposed
to several ideas that have shaped his research agenda, both in
the pricing and trading space and in the telecom one.

I need to support him and a new student I am bringing aboard on this
project for this quarter and the academic year, and I would like to see
how  we can move ahead with this year's funding for this project. I
understand that EBS has had some problems, but we are willing to expand
our research agenda to match the current needs and foci at EBS or other
groups. Eric broughtback from Enron a couple of very interesting research
problems that he/we is/are focusing on now.

Please let me know how we can proceed. I'm under some pressure by the
Department to move ahead with finalizing the research assistanships.

I look forward to see you again at Stanford or Enron.
Best Regards,

Nick

"RE: Feedback from Iris in London","Hi Vasant,

	How are you?  Sorry to hear that you are getting swamped with work.

	I am doing my best to spend time with the Enron Credit team to learn about their current (public firm) models.  In addition, I have begun to review various econometrics approaches that may be applicable to the private firm models (PCA, PLS, Cluster analysis, etc.).  Also, at the suggestion of Vince and Slava, I am trying to work on the overall ""strategic plan"" (aka the Duffie document).

	Amitava suggested that we might want to have a conference call on Tuesday with Bryan, Markus and Vince to get an update on their ever changing strategy and data needs.  Amitava said that he would ask Anita to coordinate this conference call.

	Let me know if there is anything else you would like for me to do while I am here.

Take care,
Iris

"Update on FERC Interconnection Meetings","
Overview
Since many of you can not attend every meeting at FERC  regarding Generator Interconnection, we would like to provide you with a  few highlights of the past two weeks. 
 
Interestingly, generators are finding that the Transmission  Owning (TOs) entities and ISOs have been less-combative than one may have  thought. This is largely due to Daniel Larcamp's, Director of OMTR at FERC,  statement to the TOs that they can not hide behind the excuse that prior  practice and their Open Access Transmission Tariffs (OATT) prevent  them from granting many of the reasonable requests of the generators.  Larcamp said in no uncertain terms that the current OATTs are not hard- and-fast  anymore, instead, they are most likely going to be subject  to revisions per recent FERC orders.
 
The generator group is working very well together. We, the  Alliance of Energy Suppliers, are present and very involved in all of  the generator strategy sessions and industry meetings, in addition to  having Chuck Linderman of our Alliance on the ""process group"". This  process group develops the issue lists for discussions and decides on  logistics and procedures for the upcoming meetings.  The Alliance has  also sponsored lunch for the generator group and continues to offer  our offices and conference rooms to any generators that may need office space  amenities during their extended visits here in Washington.
 
 
Procedural Schedule for Interconnection  Meetings
9:00AM       Llarger industry  session convenes to receive direction from FERC staff on the day's topics  and process
9:15-9:30-    Break into sector caucuses,  i.e. Generators, Transmission Owners (TO), RTOs/ISOs, Transmission  Dependent  
                        Utilities (TDU), and Others.
10:30-12PM- All caucus groups come together to express desired  outcomes on certain issues and topics
12:00-1:30-    Caucus Group Working  Lunches
1:30-3:30-     Larger groups convene to  discuss individual caucus groups' concerns and issues and attempt  consensus
3:45-4:45-     Individual caucus groups  meet again to discuss positions and find compromise or consensus  on issues 
5:-5:30PM-    Plenary session to chart out next  steps and topics for next meeting. 
 
Positive Meeting  Developments
 
Scope of Service 
Generators were very successful in negotiating to receive an  option for generators to have three product levels of Interconnection Service.  Optionality was a paramount issue for generators. TOs conceded to offer the  following services:
 
(1) Energy Resource- based on the PJM study process  model
(2) Network Resource- transmisison rights will be firm and  comparable to TOs network resources
(3) ""Simple interconnection"" which allows for several options  to be chosen, but basic interconnection of the directly  assigned facility is the minimum. 
 
Queuing
TOs recognized that the queue positioning issues were  generator v. generator issues, so suggested that we offer suggestions to them as  to how to structure and administer the queue. Generators agreed and developed  the rights and timing it wished. 
 
Functions of the Queues
(1) identify order of studies
(2) identifies timing of projects for developers
(3) identifies and allocates costs responsibility
 
Limited Consensus
TOs suggested, as generators had articulated that Best  practices #4 of te ANOPR be adopted as the minimum and build fro those  principles. So in essence
(1) queue position for all interconnection requests be based  on the date the TP receives the request; (
(2) the Generator must meet reasonable milestones to retain  position in the queue; 
(3) if a generator misses stipulated milestones, it will be  able to have a time period which to ""cure"" the deficiency. But if after  the reasonably agreeable time frame is exhausted, if  not cured, the generator may be at risk for losing its place in the queue;  
(4) queue position may be at risk, if a generator makes  substantial ""material change"". ( material changes must be further 
     defined by the  generators)
 
Scope of Studies and Interceonnection Agreement and  Procedures
Outstanding Questions and Issues to be addressed in Later  Session
(1) when is a generator included in the ""base case"" study or  modeling
(2) when is a generator on the hook for costs
(3) time line for when a generator receives a feasibility  study and that all developers should receives a feasibility study, unlike the  current practice where that is not the norm
(4) if a generator cancels a project that had been allocated  costs for upgrades associated with its facilities, who pays for the necessary  upgrades if the generator drops out and does not complete the project?  
 
Milestones
Generators requested that milestones be tied into the  progression of a construction project. These milestones will include time lines  and schedules. The milestones will begin when a generator applies for  interconnection. 
 
Note: TOs asked if generators could develop  the milestones since they viewed them as a generator-to-generator issue. As a  result, a group of generators joined a group of transmission owners to help  develop the milestone language. 
 
 
Drafting Team
A drafting team was formed that contains representatives from  each participatory group at the Interconnection meetings. This group  will draft consensus language for the final Interconnection document  submittal. This group takes day-by-day issues and attempts to fashion language  that represents broad consensus on these issues. The language proposals  are then vetted back through the individual caucus groups and voted on for  later approval by the entire industry group. (FERC distributed a voting guide  that helps categorize what is consensus and what is not)
 
Next Meetings
Thanksgiving week- Nov 19-23. NO  MEETINGS There will be no FERC Interconnection meetings for this week.  However, the generators will  have a caucus  conference call on Monday Nov., 19 at 11AM to prepare for the following week's  meetings. If you would like that call in number please e-mail Chuck Linderman at  Clinderman@eei.org

"Decision making opportunities","Dear Vince:

I hope you have liked the short paper on decision making I sent you a week ago.  It emphasizes the human nature of the process of decision making.  I personally believe that this line of reasoning is systematically neglected by the investment and trading communities.  I think that many of the great traders and investors are very well aware of these limitations of human mind and are making efforts to utilize them.  For example you may encounter similar ideas in the George Soros' book ""The Alchemy of Finance"".  I am certain that developing and expertise in this area bears a tremendous potential for improving  Enron's trading operations and will give us an edge with respect  to other trading powerhouses. 

Do you think there are desks at Enron that may be interested in developing a system of procedures that leads to improving our trading performance?  I will be extremely interested in working in this field.  By the way I have already gathered many of  the basic pieces of information needed for such an undertaking.

As a beginning I may make an overview of the literature available on decision biases and list as many of them as possible.  Indeed, the mind traps mentioned in the paper are not the only ones.  Later we may discuss with our clients possibilities for quantifying the influence of a selected group of these biases on the performance of our traders.  Still later, a set of questionnaries, a system for keeping trader's perceptions prior to every act of decion making, and the result of the decision will be created, etc.  

I envision the final product to be a self-educating trading system learning from every single experience, both positive and negative and utilizing the history of the decision maker to her best benefit.  After some transition period, the result should be a more enlightened process of decision making of our traders, stripped as much as possible from the common psychological biases and utilizing human judgment--the very thing which differentiates the good trader from the computer (or the bad trader, for that matter).

I will highly appreciate your opinion on these issues.

Thank you in advance.

Sincerely yours,

Anguel

Vince:

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Thanks!

"RE: Here are the correlations..............","Vince,
probably Frank is ready to listen to the isea of increasing the number of factors and capturing term-structure of correlations
by using historical log-returns as factor loadings.

Should we push for it?

Subject:	RE: Here are the correlations..............

I guess I'm confused regarding PCA? Maybe you can explain it to me better, but I'll wholeheartedly support it if we can get correlations the way the traders are thinking.  Problematically, we need this to be a huge priority because Louise Kitchen wants it implemented today, not tomorrow. 

For example, Fletcher is thinking the gas hedges lower his risk, and maybe they do, but not to the extent he believes?.

I'll come down later and we can talk about this project, project x. 


Thanks,
Frank

Frank, this is the correlation between R6 and NG. 
R6 is not under EPMI-LT-NW-PR1.

I referred to low correlations between NG and west power curves which I observed for recent data (NGI-SOCAL and R8, for example).

To capture properly term structure of correlations we need to increase the number of factors and do joint factors analysis
for all curves. This will not increase computational time or memory requirements for VAR.

Subject:	FW: Here are the correlations..............

I had Bharat run correlations and the way he did it correlations came in around 50% for prompt and 65% further back.  I want to make sure we calc it the same way. I asked Bharat to take the last 60 days of pricing, hold reference date the same.  Calculate log returns.  Then calculate correlations of log returns.

Another method we may want to consider is using the heat rate to calc correlations which is consistent with the way they hedge.

"Expected Future Curve Demand","Vince, based on the email below, it looks as if the curve demand for June-July could be heavy, based on the extensive review of international assets taking place in August.  FYI --- Gwyn

Subject:	Curve request

Gwyn,

Did you receive my voice mail message regarding the monthly request for updates to the curves for the Brazil office?  I feel this should stand as a recurring monthly request as long as they hold the positions which must be revalued each month.  If I recall correctly, they need:
	FX
			IGP-M
			CPI (include monthly data)
			PPI  Finished Goods  (include monthly data)
			PPI Industrial Commodities  (include monthly data)

What is your status on the preparation of these curves?  We will be revaluing assets extensively for the next BOD meeting (August) so I will prepare a list of curves needed for the next several months.

Please let me know about the curves for Riccardo.  Thanks again!

Cindy

"RE: Neptune -- merchant transmission","Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these
corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts
traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of
the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary
services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge
for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in
whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.

We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the
summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an
anchor tenant concept).

As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow
in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll
keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual
challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.

Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

Ed

Hello Ed,

It sounds very interesting. I forwarded your messages
to two members of my group who work on the problems related
to transmission (a key to the power markets successful
growth).

I shall share with you their  reaction.

I hope everything is going well.

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

"RATS License Update","Vasant,

I had a chance to speak today with a representative from Estima, the maker of RATS.  Evidently, our current license is as follows:

		Version:  RATS 4.0 (original license cost of $ 1,200.00)
		Max. No. of Users: 4

The following options outline the costs of upgrading the software:

Option 1

Version:  RATS 5.0
Users: Site license for Houston/unlimited

	RATS 5.0	$ 5,100.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00    	(cointegration module)
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00    	(RATS implementation of Census Bureau's seasonal adjustment--aids in 			$ 7,500.00       	adjusting quarterly and monthly data as well as options for identifying 					trading days and holidays in time series) 

Option 2

Version:  RATS 5.0
Users: 100

	RATS 5.0	$ 4,500.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00
			$ 6,900.00

Option 3

Version: RATS 5.0
Users: 50

	RATS 5.0	$ 3,600.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00
			$ 6,000.00

Option 4

Version RATS 5.0
Users: 25

	RATS 5.0	$ 2,500.00
	CATS module	$ 1,100.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,100.00
			$ 4,700.00

Note that we currently have a number of users of RATS both within Research and throughout EGM (Equities, Freight, Fundamentals, Crude Products).  I would recommend, at a minimum, that we upgrade our license to 50 users with base RATS 5.0.  Cointegration can obviously be performed without the automated CATS module--I am not too certain of the utility of the X-11 module.

All's okay with Jeff Shankman re. charging us for one of your managers.
 
Let's move forward on this as soon as possible--I have some momentum building and need to keep pushing our group ahead.
 
When you designate someone from your group for this role I would like to involve him in the hiring of their own support team.  We already have a lead on a good quant. analyst and would like the input of whomever you select for this new role.

Jeff,
 
Per our conversation earlier this month I discussed with Vince Kaminski the possibility of getting a quant. guy on permanent loan to our group to help manage the more complex analyses I want our guys to be doing.
 
Vince is amenable to letting us have one of his managers.  However, because is group is stretched thin and he wants to keep his headcount flat, he would want to hire a replacement and charge the manager we get to us.
 
I would also want to hire an analyst to help this quant. guy with general research ideas and data gathering.
 
Is this acceptable to you?

"RE: Scott's concerns about the Public Firm Models","

Hi Scott, 	
 

	How are you?  Thanks for your email.

	I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said. 

	Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the ""issues"" with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.  

	In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:
		1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000
		2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.  

	I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you can't find them, I will forward them again.

	Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to ""repair"" the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.




Regards,
Iris

Hi Iris,

I wasn't sure if you had already sent your report to Professor Duffie yet or not, but I've been thinking about ways that his group (or the Research team) could really add value in an area where we're admittedly weak - model testing.  If you haven't sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, I'd like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but I'll do that via phone.  I'm hoping there are some statistical techniques we're currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.

If you've got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, I'd love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and we're starting a model recalbration phase.  I'm least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once we've recalibrated them.

Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

Regards,
Scott

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.

Hi Lance,

	he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then interview him.

Attached is a resume for a candidate that might serve temporarily through the summer.  Maybe this could be a stop gap measure until we can locate a full time person.  I would anticipate him working as a summer intern.

"EES revenue through customer DSM projects","Vince:

Have you or a member of your group had a chance to look over the forwarded e-mail yet?  We have a meeting on Thursday with another potential client who plans to use his own capital.  His capital budgeting issues are similar to those of the client who prompted my original e-mail.

The more DSM projects that we can help the client get approved, the more DSM savings we can share with the client.  These DSM projects can turn a retail commodity contract with low profitability into a substantially more profitable contract for us.

Would one of your GARCH analyses provide us with a quantitative solution?  One of your experts in differential equations might have devised something.  We'd really like to have something quantitative if you think it's at all possible.

Thanks,

Jeff

Subject:	DSM projects as real options   

Vince:

Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power Point presentation?  At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the following:  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES customers who employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR hurdles may be lowered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow for the extra value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced power consumption/dependence.

I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewing a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive.  First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we exercise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple NPV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate ""negawatts,"" extending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--whenever the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity price, associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value of this strip a ""residual time value"" associated with the original DSM option.  If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total value that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able to help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high IRR hurdle.

Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a ""qualitative"" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers to lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.

We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage around his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside a large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a small portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology, which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.

In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification, or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in the attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify ""residual time value"" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of a more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?

Thanks,

Jeff Gray

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.


Vince

We have backup tapes for deleted email.  David Cohen is aware of this and in fact we are following Wilmer Cutler's advice on all of these issues.  Britt's message is in response to a recently-received subpoena and is a precaution until we can speak with the Wilmer lawyers.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Britt,

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Vince

"Rice Energy Club Roundtable topics","
Dear John, dear Vincent,
 
Let me up-date you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting to focus on during the rest of the academic year.  The original idea was to keep the number of events from 3 to 4 roundtables each semester.  The result of the last meeting with all members was driven by enthusiasm, and as you see below we produced a prolific list of 13 subjects.  Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable number, 12 events (one we had yesterday) by May 2002 we think are too many. 
 
I also would take this opportunity to update on the ongoing relationships with the most prominent industry in the sectors and have your feedback, suggestion on how to group them in the roundtable.
We got great support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell (Coral), Bp, Duke.   El Paso, Chevron-Texaco, Phillips, and Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the club to them as well.  The major challenge for us is not transform the Energy Club in a Finance Energy Club.  At Rice we already have a Finance club and it works very well.  We want first educate about the energy industry in general, and second present the opportunities for MBAs in the industry in different areas, including finance but not limited to.
 
Topics of Roundtable Meetings:
 
0) Energy ""101"" 
1) Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller)
2) Energy Consulting
3) Financial Services (trading, risk management)
4) Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) - Marteen
5) Project Development, strategic planning
6) Project Finance
7) Project Risk Management
8) Regulation, Deregulation, and Restructuring - Reliant done 9/17/2001
9) Structuring of Products
10) Supply Chain
11) Telecom - Broadband
12) Venture Capital within energy industry - Brian, Paresh
 
Thanks in advance for your precious suggestions and I am looking forward to meeting you.

First of all I want to thank you for your hospitality and to apologize
for a delay in responding to you. It was quite a tumultuous week
and the turbulence continues.

The outline of commitments with the information on what I have done to 
jumpstart the process.

1.	Review of the CEPEL model / simplified model. Chonawee
started the review process, with the help of our two native Portuguese speakers.
Less complicated/faster to run model will follow.

2.	SDDP. As you know Tom Halliburton is in Norway this week.
They put their grimy fingers on him first.
He will be back next week and will help you  to set up the SDDP runs.
He even volunteer to stay on the job for a few days longer to help
you with the project.

3.	Transmission modeling. Martin Lin will call Dave to jumpstart the process.

4.	Zimin will call David regarding swing option model, option pricing models
for non-standard distributions and truncated distributions.

5.	Cooperation with the SA University in the area of the weather research 
	Remains to be discussed with Jose and Mike.

Enron Japan received a presentation today from a nuclear physicist working for Toshiba who has developed an application of the Boltzmann model to finance.  We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Group's Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html

Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.

Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them. 

Regards,
Mark Brady

"Mark Palmer re Andy Fastow","Vince:

I've been on the road for a week and will be in southeast Asia and Australia for the following week. I did, however, get a message from Mark Palmer saying that he thought I should present our stuff on current operations value/future growth value directly to Andy Fastow. I agree this makes sense.

Nevertheless, I think the idea would have greater credibility if you, in addition to Mark, were to express an interest in the framework to Andy. Would you be comfortable doing this? I'd just like you to send Andy a message saying that you think the COV/FGV framework is logical and that investors would find it logical as well.

If you can do this, Melissa Jose would then give Andy's office a call and try to set up a convenient time for a presentation. Of course, I would be very happy if you could attend that as well. That would also give the two of us an opportunity to explore that article we have been meaning to write!

Best Regards,

Gayle,

Apologies for the delay in responding to your message.

I will have the LDC projector and an overhead projector available.  I
suggest that Vince arrive around 10:30 -10:45 a.m. and I will plan to be at
the location to assist him.

The exact address is:  JPMorgan Chase Center, 601 Travis, 18th floor.

Parking is available in that building with entrances on Travis, Texas and
Capital.  The garage elevators bring you to the lobby level.  A Security
Guard Station is on the lobby level where check-in is required before
proceeding to the 18th floor lounge where the meeting will take place.  The
Security Guard will have Vince's name and will allow him access.

I can be reached that morning by cell phone at 832-752-6257.

Hope this is all the info needed, but if not, let me know.  See you on
Wednesday.

Regards,
mecoffey

      Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press.
   Hopefully,
      this
      has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.
   The
      title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting
   notices.
      If
      you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this
   toward
      the
      attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have
   something
      to
      provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
      appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is
      needed
      as soon as possible. Please advise.
      Thank you.

         November 15 presentation is still on my calendar. I shall be
   leaving

         that

   I
         should
         have plenty of time to get to the airport.

         Please, feel free to invite guests from other industries. I shall
      send
         you
         the title of the presentation  from home tomorrow morning.

"The GARP 2002 Convention: gentle reminder","
Dear Convention Speaker
 
I am writing concerning the GARP 2002 Convention,  which will be held at the Roosevelt Hotel, New York on 11th to 14th February  2002.
 
This is just a gentle reminder that speaker  presentations should be e-mailed to me by Friday 14th  December to ensure that they are placed in the delegate packs. I am  sure that you can appreciate that with over 80 speakers, this is a massive  logistical task and requires advance planning. After this date, I can not  guarantee that they will be included in the delegate packs.
 
Moreover, if you have not yet returned you  speaker checklist by fax, can you please return this as soon as possible.  Also, if you are staying at the Roosevelt Hotel, please complete the hotel  form and fax it directly to the hotel. If you do not have a form, please  do e-mail me and I will forward one to you.
 
Finally, if you would like the brochure to  be received by any financial or risk professionals, please do provide me  with the names and any contact details (e-mail or postal address) and  I will ensure they receive a copy. 
 
If you have any questions or queries please do not  hesitate to contact me. I look forward to receiving your presentation next week  and to meeting you in New York in February.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

 	 	    Dear Vincent,  Solar and wind power have long been used as renewable sources of energy.  On Wednesday, we'll have a report on an interesting alternative to these renewables.  ENL's Gale Smith will tell us about a Louisiana company that is using rice hulls to produce electricity.  Catch Gale's report from Houston tomorrow.   The Enron/Dynegy negotiations continue and Gale tells me the Houston bureau is keeping close tabs on all developments.   Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' David Hitchcock will talk to ENL's Kym McNicholas Wednesday about California's current credit rating.  The state is set to issue a proposed $12.5 billion in revenue bonds and Hitchcock will discuss whether renegotiating California's long-term power contracts could delay the process.     Kym will also speak with the Executive Director of the California Natural Gas Producers Association John Martini.  He'll address the unspecified threats to U.S. pipelines.  Watch for those details from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday.   We'll have an interview from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.  Alaron Trading Vice President Phil Flynn will join us to discuss the API and DOE numbers and tell us what's going on with the brewing OPEC price war.  We'll hear from Flynn during the noon ET newscast tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Nov. 27, 2001    Crude: $19.48 +$0.79   Unleaded: $0.5381 +$0.0164   Heating Oil: $0.5394 +$0.0177   Natural Gas: $2.606 -$0.09   We'll have live coverage from Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday.

Subject:	Operational Risk Management

I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operational Risk Management task force.  How does Tuesday, October 16th and the afternoon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?  Please let me know your schedule for both of these dates.  Most of the task force members have been identified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.  Sally Beck will identify representatives from these two areas.  I would also expect that other individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or resources or required.  

I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.  The agenda will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:

	Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - What's in and What's Out
	Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the group)
	     Develop Common Language
                 Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk
	     Role of this task force  - Strategy
	     Set common objectives for implementation this year and a look forward to 2002
	Current Initiatives
	Communications Plan 
	Open Discussion - Other Ideas from the group 
			  - Suggestions re other groups/individuals to include on the task force
	

I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.  We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operational risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.  

Thanks, 
Wanda Curry

"RE: visit to Houston","Dear Vince,

I will be in Houston from the 1 July to (at least) the 7th July. 

I will call you tomorrow morning (Houston time) to discuss the current issues and how we can move forward in a way that is beneficial 
for Enron North America (the research group, the gas desk and the power desk). I would like to use tomorrow's call to highlight my

"request","Hello Vince--- Have a request for you. We're preparing our Annual End of Year Issue this week and wanted to ask for your participation. The issue is a sort of combo issue merging all of our publications (The Desk, The Risk Desk, New Power Exec and The Bandwidth Desk), and takes a look at trends, review of the year in about 20 categories (tech, policy, VC stuff, market trends, credit, strategies, risk, book reviews, weather) and of course a look ahead. Most of the submitted pieces we run are in the form of commentaries on specific topics -- we're trying to stay away from the usual broad, mushy stuff you read about this time of the year -- translation, we're looking for a detailed view of things -- open with a short take on key bits that occurred this year, how it may have altered the course of the market or a particular sector (why or why not with details) and finally what's ahead. The general formula works well we've found; we expect the issue to be at least 40 pages this year. I'm sure you remember the drill from last year. Anyhow, back to you. What I'm looking for is this -- the fall of the Big E has certainly put more focus on better risk management -- great, but what does that really mean? Consider some of the commentaries or interviews you're run in the past on the strategy/tactics side, and rethink the juicy bits. What have we (the traded markets, or retail for that matter) not yeat fully learned or embraced? Do you think next year will see an altogether different power market? Why or why not. Specific changes in your space? Each year for the past 5 years, there has been one big event that has seemingly changed the way we do or think about things. What will this year mean to 2002? Whether in terms of systems, credit, ops, venture investment, risk management, marketing, managing the book, whatever. The key in this, is detail and specifics. What's it going to take to get people to play smarter? Need about 1000 words (more or less, your call), which you can probably do over cheerios in the morning. The deadline is Dec. 18. We'll be spinning out the issue to about 5,000 people, so the exposure should be very good for you--we'll include contact names and numbers etc. If this is doable, please let me know asap. Otherwise, hope you and the fam is well, hey -- don't be such a stranger for Gods sake. Again, Dec. 18 deadline.
Best,
John

From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Jeff Skilling- President and CEO@ENRON
Sent:	Wednesday, May 09, 2001 1:55 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Changes to PRC Process


MEMORANDUM

TO:		All Employees

FROM:	Jeff Skilling

DATE:	 	May 9, 2001

SUBJECT:	Changes to PRC Process

Enron's midyear Performance Review process is now underway.  The PRC system is the backbone of Enron's meritocracy and is a critical part of the process of managing, rewarding, and moving talent.  The system allows us to provide 360-degree feedback on employee performance; to evaluate skill levels across Enron on a relative basis; to align individual performance with compensation decisions; and to inform our staffing decisions.

The PRC process begins when you access the Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system and suggest reviewers who can best speak about your performance.  Once all the feedback is received, your supervisor will use it to assist in determining your performance relative to your peers in the same job group in a Performance Review Committee meeting.  In the meeting, supervisors make a rating recommendation supported by a description of the individual's performance during the review period and an indication of the feedback received.  The decision of the committee on relative performance must be unanimous for all employees under review.

At the end of last year, we asked you to provide us with feedback on how we could improve the PRC process without compromising the philosophy behind the system.  Based on your comments and suggestions, the PRC Committee and the Enron Policy Committee have agreed upon several modifications that will streamline the process.  These changes include online access to the PEP system through our ClickAtHome portal, shorter forms, changes to the rating system, and the opportunity to provide feedback on your supervisor.  These changes are outlined in detail below.  

?	Eligibility - In an effort to ensure that new employees have amassed a sufficient track record and are evaluated appropriately, a minimum of six months tenure at Enron will be required before an employee is included and evaluated in a PRC meeting.  Consequently, employees hired after December 31, 2000, will not be included in the mid-year PRC ratings process.  These employees will nevertheless solicit and receive feedback via the PEP system and must receive a final evaluation from their managers.  Because of the opportunity for rapid development in the Analyst/Associate Program, all Analysts and Associates with a minimum of three months tenure (hired prior to March 1, 2001) will be included and rated in a PRC meeting.  
?	Non-exempt Employees - Non-exempt employees (administrative and clerical) will not be rated in a formal PRC meeting.  Individual Business Units or groups may choose to discuss their non-exempt employees, but this is not required.  The sole requirement for non-exempt employees is that they receive a rating of 1-3 (1 and 2 bonus eligible, and 3 not bonus eligible).   They will continue to solicit feedback via the PEP system, and as in the past, they must receive a written final evaluation from their supervisor.  
?	Rating Clusters - Last year we used the following descriptors to determine relative rating: ""superior, excellent, strong, satisfactory, needs improvement and issues.""  Many employees believed that these descriptors were not useful in light of the relative evaluation process.  So this year we will use numerical relative ratings of 1-5 (with 1 being the highest).  Those in categories 1-4 are bonus eligible; those in category 5 are not bonus eligible.  For those in category 5, the consequences (besides not receiving a bonus) include implementation of a Development Plan or, in the event of continuing performance issues, consideration of ongoing employment.
?	Preferred Distribution - Consistent with the relative rating approach, employees' performance will be grouped in accordance with the following distribution:  5% level 1, 30% level 2, 30% level 3, 20% level 4, 15% level 5.  This grouping requires PRC committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at Enron as well as to identify top talent for special recognition.  There is flexibility in the system, but every organization must exercise informed discretion to meet a distribution that reflects that organization's overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
?	Ensuring higher quality reviews - In the past, employees and their supervisors could select an unlimited number of reviewers.  This approach reduced the quality of the written feedback, with many forms filled out only with rating information.  To ensure higher quality written reviews, the PEP system will limit the number of reviewers an employee may select for feedback to a maximum of 7.  Additionally, the PEP forms have been revised to encourage more written feedback and reduce reliance on ratings.
?	Feedback Forms -The 360-degree feedback forms have been reduced to one page; however, the
	system will accommodate more detailed written feedback.
?	Unsolicited Feedback - In the event an individual is not selected as a reviewer but wants to provide feedback on an employee, he or she may do so via the Unsolicited Feedback feature in PEP.  Unsolicited Feedback is in addition to the maximum of seven reviews.
?	Self-evaluation Form - The self-evaluation form has been revised to provide employees with a forum to list their accomplishments during the review period.   The employee's list of accomplishments will be available for viewing by the PRC committee during the meeting.  
?	Reviewing your supervisor - Employees will have the opportunity to review their supervisors and to rate the effectiveness of their supervisors' delivery of feedback.
?	Disclosure of Ratings - Disclosure of a rating in cluster 5 is mandatory across the organization; disclosure of ratings in clusters 1-4 is at the supervisor's discretion.  
?	Access through ClickAtHome - U.S. employees will be able to access and complete feedback and self-evaluation forms through the ClickAtHome portal at www.enron@clickathome.net <http://www.enron@clickathome.net>.  This will provide employees the convenience to complete these forms at home or at the office.

PRC is part of our competitive edge.  It is our goal to make you aware of any changes to the process and system as soon as we are able to do so.  If you have any questions regarding PRC or PEP, I encourage you to speak with your supervisor, contact your HR representative or e-mail perfmgmt@enron.com <mailto:perfmgmt@enron.com>.  PEP opens May 7, 2001; feedback closes on May 25, 2001.  PRC Meetings will take place from June 4-29, 2001.  The Executive PRC meetings are 
July 23-24, 2001.  Thank you for your participation in this process.

"RE: E-mail Retention","Vince, 

Thanks for the email.  This new message from Britt Davis is in response to a recently-received subpoena, and is just a precaution until we can discuss what is required with Wilmer Cutler.  Even though emails would have been deleted from your system we have retained the backup tapes so we have a complete record.  Please let me know if there are some that you wish to retrieve.

Thanks and have a happy New Year.

Britt,

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Vince

Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Christian,

Want you to have not only a smmoth but enjoyable transition to the U.S.

I asked Anne Labbe to send you some info:

Enron can set you all up for 30 days in very nice housing to allow you and Mary (and kids) to get your feet wet, determine what part of town you like, etc.

As far as I'm concerned, ready for you to join the team as early in January as possible, but understand your need to get the family properly situated.  If the 16th works out better for you along those lines, that's fine with me.

Hi Mike,

I would like to finalise the actual first day in Houston. I think the earlier I start the 
better. At the moment I can see two possible options:

1. Jan. 2nd, with a trip prior to organise house and school

2. Jan. 16th where I would arrive early in the year to organise house and school

School staff is back on the 7th. 

Let's discuss. 

Please let me know when I can call you. 

There are also a few other things I need to organise with the various national weather services before I come over to the US. Basically, we will have top level access to 
(raw) data. 


Cheers,
Christian

"Statistical Modelling of CDS Prices","Guys

Next week we're planning on recalibrating the dummified regression models (""placement models"") built earlier this year and last for the Enron Credit pricing system. These basically have the objective of predicting a 5-yr CDS price for an illiquid name, based on available data. This data consists of:
Credit Ratings, Outlook and Watch
Equity based data - eg, EDF, 90d Volatility, Beta, Market Cap, Dividend yield, PE ratio
Financial ratios - eg, EBITDA interest coverage, Current ratio, EPS, Debt to Assets
Descriptive Info - Country and Industry

I've outlined the methodology used for the models thus far in the attached docs:

   
We're kicking off this effort next week with a brainstorming session with the trading desk, to outline areas of deficiency and proposed model improvements. From the quantitative side we'd appreciate greatly if any or all of you could read these docs and offer any suggestions for improvement of the models. Any ideas on statistical techniques or the overall methodology will be welcome. I'd also be happy to set up meetings or just talk on the phone if any further explanation is required.

Dear Shirley,

I have emailed and voice mailed Vince about confirming his scheduled

from him yet.  I have him scheduled to present to students on 11/15 from 
11-2, and on 11/16 to present a seminar to the finance faculty.  I also 
have a room reserved for him at the Judge Baylor house in Waco for the 
evening of 11/15.  My colleagues and I plan to take him out to dinner on 
the evening of 11/15.

Anyway, can you confirm these plans for me?

Thanks,

Rakesh, 
I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4 
that I cannot sign off on any analysis 
done by our group without looking at full set of 
legal documents related to the LJM 
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore 
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past. 
I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support 
the valuations based on verbal and 
often conflicting information, without doing  full due 
diligence. 
Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but, 
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis 
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict 
between 
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in 
my view, 
mutually exclusive.

"RE: OStrip Function","I know, Zimin. It was/is an honest mistake, and I am hurting from it. It does seem that things have worked out, and that the issue has been resolved with Larry May and John Griffith. Additionally, I have been in touch with Jeremy Wong to ask that the ERMS coding be updated, and have been in communication with Eric Moon (Gas Structuring) to make sure that the structurers are aware of the changes made. Eric told me that they have always used the OSTRIP function for fixed price options in the manner which is correct by the documentation.
 
Paulo suggested that I find out if there are any power traders who use the function and alert them. I asked Alex but he didn't know of anyone. I also talked to Iris, but she didn't know of anyone either, although she did say that they have priced strips on the power desk before. Would you know of anyone who uses this function on the power desks, so that I might contact them? Thanks.

Subject: OStrip Function



As you know, the Ostrip Functionality has been altered.  This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options.  The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked.  Let me explain.  The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs:

NowToSet        - Fixed Price = zero 
                - Forward Start = days from now until strike is set 

BegDays - Fixed Price = days from now until start of option 
                - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option 

EndDays - Fixed Price = days from now until end of option 
                - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option 

FwdStFlag       - Fixed Price = 0 
                - Forward Start = 1 

The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option).  It assumes the option is set right now.  The ""Old Ostrip Model"" did not overlook this input.  This is the problem.  In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same.  Thus when the ""Old Ostrip Model"" incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly.  When the ""New Ostrip Model"" was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.

Larryoptmodel has to be changed to reflect the above inputs.  It is actually only a change to one date.  This date will be used in calculating the three days above.  If the option is a fixed price option then the date will be today and NowToSet will be Today minus Today (zero), BegDays will be Start of Option minus today, EndDays will be End of Option minus today.  If the option is a forward start option, then the date will be when the strike is set and the NowToSet with be the strike setting date minus today, BegDays will be Start of Option minus the strike date, EndDays will be the End of Option minus strike date.

It is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first.  If there was a problem with the ""Old Ostrip Model"" then the trader should have been notified right away.  This could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading.  In this case, however, Larry had figured a way around this problem and he was valuing correctly.  When the model was changed, that changed the larryoptmodel valuation and now it was being valued incorrectly.  Either way, any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away.  Any changes to the models should be communicated to the traders before they are made.

Please let me know if any have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. 

John

"Enterprise-wide Risk Management","Vince, I was just thinking about the subject project that you were trying to get off the ground (even though no commercial support existed!) that I worked on initially.  I know you were trying to get this done before I arrived and then followed my effort with at least one other person. I think the reason we could not complete a comprehensive project was we did not have the mandate from the CEO office to do it so that relevant commercial and functional entities can provide the required information.

Perhaps the reason there were no major thrust from the management was that most people knew the answer was going to be less than desirable.  However, such information would have correctly priced the risk (to the shareholder not its agents--the management) so that we could have better managed the $20 Billion or so company specific (taking systemic market down turn, including telecom exposure, out) market value that perished.  

Great intuition on your part in trying to get such a risk measurement tool implemented. I wonder if you were able to advance that project and I now wonder if Greg Whaley would be interested sponsoring it from his office.  I would love to be the 'commercial' lead interfacing with you to get such a project done now since it may help us with relevant (risk worthy) disclosure.

"Plastics Models","Vasant,

I wanted to keep you up-to-date on the redevelopment of forward curves for the suite of 7 plastics (ethylene contract, ethylene spot, propylene contract, propylene spot, polypropylene, HDPE, LLDPE).  As you may recall, we talked about fitting all of the components into a VAR model and solving the system of simultaneous equations.  Unfortunately, with a limited dataset (say 5 years or so), our degrees of freedom in such a model are dramatically reduced.  Alternatively, Mauricio and I have decided to construct individual models for each of the plastics commodities while utilizing results from the initial VAR analysis as a guide.  

Based on the petrochemicals flowsheet, both propylene and ethylene are fashioned directly from raw materials such as crude oil, coal, and natural gas.  In turn, polypropylene may be made from propylene while HDPE and LLDPE use ethylene as a raw material.  Given this logical flow, we restricted our model specifications in the following manner (all price variables tested for stationarity--first difference used in all cases):

1) Construct models for ethylene contract and ethylene spot based on AR terms, WTI, and natural gas.  Determine the ""best"" model between ethylene contract and ethylene spot as a function of these variables (based on R2).

2) Supplement the model above with the smaller R2 value with the contemporaneous and lagged values of the dependent variable from the other model (e.g., construct ethylene contract as a function and WTI and natural gas--construct ethylene spot as a basis to ethylene contract).

3) Repeat the process for propylene refinery grade and propylene chemical grade.  

4) For polypropylene, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of propyleneRG, propyleneCG, WTI, and natural gas.

5) For HDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, WTI, and natural gas.

6) For LLDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, HDPE, WTI, and natural gas.

Note that we are aware of the ""cascading error"" problem as we move from model to model.  Alternatively, we can construct each model based only on WTI and natural gas (see first-cut of polypropylene model).  We do have monthly fundamental supply and demand information for 3 of the plastics (polypropylene, HDPE, and LLDPE) and will incorporate this data as well.  Alan Engberg has forwarded the latest 12 month forward curves from the current model that is being used.  He has also offered his own projections for these commodities over the next 12 months.  We'll compare the revised model projections with both the old model projections and Alan's numbers and then make a decision on next steps.

Nelson

Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express-November 6, 2001
 
Federal Affairs
 
***Proponents of an Energy Bill Continue to Press Democrats for Senate  Floor Consideration***
 
Proponents of comprehensive energy legislation continued pressure on the  Senate Democratic leadership to bring an energy bill to the floor before  Congress adjourns for the year. The need for a bill was emphasized by the  President, the Secretary of Energy; Senate Republicans; and representatives of  veterans' groups, organized labor, and other parties at various venues last  week.
 
Senate Republicans informed Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) that they  might offer a comprehensive energy bill as an amendment to the economic stimulus  package slated to be considered in the near future if the Leader does not bring  an energy bill to the floor. A strategy previously considered, to attempt to  attach an energy measure to an appropriations bill, could have been blocked as  non-germane. 
 
Meanwhile, Sen. Daschle indicated that Congress might not be able to  conclude its work by Thanksgiving, and possibly would have to return to  Washington following the holiday. Many lawmakers had been focusing on a  mid-November departure date, with the latest continuing funding resolution set  to expire on the 16th.
 
And across Capitol Hill, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy  Tauzin (R-LA) suggested that there will not be time to complete congressional  action on energy legislation this year, although he commented that the longer  lawmakers were in session, the better prospects would become.
 
***Senate Environment Hearing Points To Lack of Consensus On  Multi-Pollutant Measure*** 
 
Few signs of consensus emerged last week from a Senate Environment  Committee hearing on S 556, the Clean Power Act, introduced by the panel's  chairman, Sen. James Jeffords (I-VT). The chairman advocates resumption of  efforts to develop and pass a bill to significantly reduce emissions of SO2,  NOx, mercury, and CO2 by January 1, 2007.
 
Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH) spoke against the bill, explaining it would  ""kill our economy,"" and that the ""numbers in this bill are devastating."" Sen.  Bob Smith (R-NH) said that current laws contain ""obstacles to cleaning up the  air"" and stressed the importance of addressing emissions separate from a command  and control system. Agreeing with Sen. Smith, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-MO)  termed S 556 the ""wrong solution for the problem we face.""
 
EPA Assistant Administrator Jeff Holmstead testified that the approach  offered in S 556 would unnecessarily raise energy costs and jeopardize energy  supplies. Current analysis suggests that it would result in a 32-50 percent  increase in consumer rates, he reported. 
 
Senate Environment plans a second hearing on S 556 in two weeks. This  session will give industry and others an opportunity to testify on the Clean  Power bill. However, with lawmakers considering a target adjournment date of  November 16, it appears that any future action on a multi-emissions bill may  have to wait until the second session of the Congress. 
 
EEI NEWS
 
***America's Electric Utilities Set to Operate Successfully In a Changed  Environment, EEI's President Emphasizes***
 
America's shareholder-owned electric utilities are ""well positioned to  operate successfully in a changed world,"" EEI President Tom Kuhn said at EEI's  annual Financial Conference. The companies are responding effectively to  emerging business challenges, he indicated, as they continue to advocate public  policies to promote effective competition and help ensure a reliable and  affordable supply of electricity.
 
The environment in which the industry now is operating, EEI's president  noted, has been significantly affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11.  Today's most important mission is critical infrastructure protection, Mr. Kuhn  said, with a new EEI CEO task force working with a variety of stakeholders to  strengthen security procedures. 
 
Mr. Kuhn also highlighted the industry's financial performance, which  remains strong. Revenues were up approximately 63 percent during the first six  months of 2001, he reported, a trend that continued through the third  quarter.
 
***KeySpan Earns EEI Index Award***
 
The Institute has honored KeySpan Corporation for long-term financial  achievement with the EEI Index Award, in recognition of the company's 265  percent total return over the five-year period 1996-2000. The award was  presented by EEI President Tom Kuhn to KeySpan Chairman and CEO Robert Catell at  the association's 36th Financial Conference, held this week in New Orleans.  
 
The EEI Index of investor-owned electric utilities is a peer group index  that values total return on each electric utility over a five-year period. It is  regarded as a benchmark for long-term financial performance, and is used by over  one-third of EEI member companies in their proxy statements. 
 
For the 1996-2000 period, KeySpan's 265 percent return topped the EEI  Index. Other leading performers included Black Hills Corporation, with a return  of 240 percent; MDU Resources, 201 percent; Exelon Corporation, 196 percent; and  Cleco Corporation, 163 percent 
 
""KeySpan's financial success is impressive, and it stands as a tribute to  its management and employees,"" Mr. Kuhn commented. ""Over the past five years,  KeySpan consistently produced improved financial results through key  acquisitions and a growing gas distribution network, pleasing both customers and  shareholders.""
 
***EEI Expresses Interest in Working With Task Force Established by  President To Bolster Infrastructure***
 
It is critical for US economic prosperity and energy security that the  barriers to expansion of the nation's electric infrastructure be removed, and  EEI and its member companies will work with the Energy Task Force established by  President Bush to accomplish this objective, announced EEI last week. 
 
EEI provided its views in response to the Council on Environmental  Quality's request for input on the activities of the Energy Task Force  established by Executive Order 13212, signed by President Bush in May. In its  comments, EEI pointed out that with a multitude of federal agencies involved in  the permitting of energy facilities, the Task Force must facilitate effective  coordination among these units and more timely action on the issuance of permits  for generating plants and transmission lines. 
 
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
 
***FirstEnergy/GPU Merger Closes***
 
FirstEnergy has announced that its merger with GPU will be finalized  tomorrow. [NANCY, THIS TEXT IS FOR TODAY, IF IT GOES OUT TOMORROW, CHANGE IT TO  TODAY].   ""With today's closing of our merger, we will begin operating  as a larger, stronger company, better positioned to provide significant benefits  t our customers, shareholders and employees,"" said CEO H. Peter Burg.   
 
FirstEnergy's board of directors now consists of 16 members-10 from  FirstEnergy and six from GPU.  
 
***Progress Energy Buying Two Plants From LG&E***
 
Progress Energy Corporation announced that their Progress Ventures unit  plans to buy two electric generating plants in Georgia from LG&E Energy  Corporation for $345 million.  The wholesale energy group is seeking to  expand its reach in the Southeast.  The two natural gas-fired projects,  owned by a subsidiary of LG&E, generate 1,182 megawatts of  electricity.  
 
The deal is subject to regulatory approvals, including approval from FERC,  and is expected to be completed by early 2002.
 
NEW GENERATION
 
***Wisconsin Energy Setting Up Generation Subsidiary***
Wisconsin Energy  has announced that it has created a subsidiary to design, permit, build and own  the new in-state power plants that are proposed as part of the company's Power  the Future strategy. Thomas Fehring, corporate secretary of WEC and Wisconsin  Electric-Wisconsin Gas has been appointed vice president and general manager of  the new subsidiary, which will be named W.E. Power. Mr. Fehring will report to  Richard Abdoo, WEC chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
""As we  move forward with Power the Future, it is vital that we focus on the flawless,  efficient and effective execution of the plant construction portion of this  plan,"" Mr. Abdoo said. ""It is equally important that we continue to focus on our  current utility operations."" 
The company has announced it will seek to build  2,800 megawatts of new, in-state generation, including two 500 megawatt combined  cycle gas-fired units at the company's existing Port Washington Power Plant  site, and three 600 megawatt advanced technology, coal-based generation units at  its Oak Creek Power Plant site. The Power the Future plan must still undergo  extensive regulatory review on engineering, cost and environmental issues. The  company plans to file the necessary regulatory applications and environmental  documentation associated with building the new electric generation, which will  fall under purview of W.E. Power, later this year.
 
***Calpine Plans 1,100 MW California Plant***
 
Calpine Corporation has announced it has applied to build a 1,100-megawatt  power plant in central California that could be in operation by mid-2004.   The proposed Central Valley Energy Center would be located in San Joaquin,  California.  ""After the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, this is considered  California's most electrically vulnerable region,"" said Curt Hildebrand, Calpine  vice president of business development.

Paulo and Tom,

I have created a directory SAM  in O:\research\common\projects\options where I saved the source
codes and spreadsheets for SAM models.

This model is developed by Vince, Stinson and myself. It was audited by Professor Duffie.
Any further development has to proplerly credit the original developer. 
Do not forget that when you are marketing it.

I want all the further development be contained in the above mentioned SAM directory.


Here are two further development issues:

1). Set constriants, say we have to full at the end of Oct., this can be done through introduction of penalty;
2). Back test the delta hedges suggested by the model. It may require a lot of time.

Subject:	Enterprise Wide Risk Management

Hello, everyone.  I'm hoping you know of someone who would be a good fit for an interesting opportunity in Market Risk Management in RAC:

We're looking for a director level accountant or risk management operations person who can join the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) group within Market Risk Management to work on the Asset/Liability piece of Enterprise Risk Management project as we team up with Vince Kaminski's Research group on this challenging new initiative.

The ideal candidate would have Enron experience and be a good project manager, accustomed to working in self-directed situations, able to work with and gain the team support of  mid and upper level management in  research, accounting, risk management operations, finance, treasury, RAC, the business units, etc..  They would need to be able to articulate for top support and commercial management any project issues and implementation challenges, and would be working with risk mgmt operations and the business units on the implementation efforts and process design.  Someone able to take full responsibility for this long term project from its infancy through completion, designing a plan of attack, and then leading the implementation effort.  This person might also act as a consultant for SRM's other initiatives that impact accounting.  Ideally, of course, this person would understand risk management (risk books, trading operations, etc.), but someone who understands the different types of risks inherent in our strategic assets and accrual accounting contracts might also be a good fit if they're self-motivated and willing to dig in and learn the risk management business.

I think it's a great opportunity for someone to broaden their resume and gain market risk management expertise.  We've met with top risk management consultants, and this is a cutting edge initiative that will put us head and shoulders above our peers.

If you want to forward this to potential candidates, below are some links to websites that may provide some overview information on asset-liability / EW risk management (I haven't reviewed the sites myself yet).  Also, Vince's outline on Enterprise Risk Management from early last year is attached below.  

Please call me if you know of someone who might be interested.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

Hi Scott,

	I stand to be corrected.  I forgot that the recording of dates in the UK is different from the way it is recorded in the US.  The date on Geoge's document is ""04/10/00"", i.e., October 4, 2000.  

	Again, Jeff stated that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to sort out the public firm model issues.  Until then, I am busy trying to develop the private firm model - which is the deliverable we promised to Enron Credit (as stated in the Elaboration Document I sent last week).


Best regards,

Subject:	RE: Scott's concerns about the Public Firm Models

Hi Iris,

I also have copies of and have read the documents you mention; while they contain some good information, especially the movement model plan, the meeting summary is just that...a very general summary of a meeting with recommendations like ""hire quants and make sure there is adequate communication among the different teams"".  The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying ""be aware of the time dimension"" which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade.    

Perhaps you didn't understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report.  We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned.  As I'm sure you recall, the teleconference with Vince, Vasant, and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models, the scope of the project, and data acquisition considerations.  After the call, you suggested to Bryan, Eric, Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in George's 2 documents (movement model and meeting summary).  My personal hope, echoed by Bryan at that time, was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model, as you surely learned in your visit, is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail.    

I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated, team-oriented approach.  I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference.

Best regards,
Scott

FYI - George joined the company in Sep 2000 so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April 2000.

Hi Scott, 	
 

	How are you?  Thanks for your email.

	I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said. 

	Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the ""issues"" with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.  

	In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:
		1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000
		2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.  

	I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you can't find them, I will forward them again.

	Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to ""repair"" the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.




Regards,
Iris

Subject:	Report to Professor Duffie

Hi Iris,

I wasn't sure if you had already sent your report to Professor Duffie yet or not, but I've been thinking about ways that his group (or the Research team) could really add value in an area where we're admittedly weak - model testing.  If you haven't sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, I'd like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but I'll do that via phone.  I'm hoping there are some statistical techniques we're currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.

If you've got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, I'd love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and we're starting a model recalbration phase.  I'm least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once we've recalibrated them.

Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

Regards,
Scott

Subject:	Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product

Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.  

Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would feature similar assets and services.
SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers that comprise each segment. 
The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried from PCCS.
The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly.
Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real estate segment.


  


Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.

Thanks.

Richard

"RE: Scott's concerns about the Public Firm Models","Hi Scott,

	I stand to be corrected.  I forgot that the recording of dates in the UK is different from the way it is recorded in the US.  The date on Geoge's document is ""04/10/00"", i.e., October 4, 2000.  

	Again, Jeff stated that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to sort out the public firm model issues.  Until then, I am busy trying to develop the private firm model - which is the deliverable we promised to Enron Credit (as stated in the Elaboration Document I sent last week).


Best regards,
Iris

Subject:	RE: Scott's concerns about the Public Firm Models

Hi Iris,

I also have copies of and have read the documents you mention; while they contain some good information, especially the movement model plan, the meeting summary is just that...a very general summary of a meeting with recommendations like ""hire quants and make sure there is adequate communication among the different teams"".  The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying ""be aware of the time dimension"" which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade.    

Perhaps you didn't understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report.  We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned.  As I'm sure you recall, the teleconference with Vince, Vasant, and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models, the scope of the project, and data acquisition considerations.  After the call, you suggested to Bryan, Eric, Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in George's 2 documents (movement model and meeting summary).  My personal hope, echoed by Bryan at that time, was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model, as you surely learned in your visit, is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail.    

I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated, team-oriented approach.  I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference.

Best regards,
Scott

FYI - George joined the company in Sep 2000 so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April 2000.

Subject:	RE: Scott's concerns about the Public Firm Models



Hi Scott, 	
 

	How are you?  Thanks for your email.

	I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said. 

	Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the ""issues"" with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.  

	In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:
		1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000
		2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.  

	I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you can't find them, I will forward them again.

	Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to ""repair"" the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.




Regards,
Iris

Subject:	Report to Professor Duffie

Hi Iris,

I wasn't sure if you had already sent your report to Professor Duffie yet or not, but I've been thinking about ways that his group (or the Research team) could really add value in an area where we're admittedly weak - model testing.  If you haven't sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, I'd like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but I'll do that via phone.  I'm hoping there are some statistical techniques we're currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.

If you've got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, I'd love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and we're starting a model recalbration phase.  I'm least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once we've recalibrated them.

Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

Regards,
Scott

Attached are files for our project. The word section is in .pdf format and
excel models are zipped to reduce size. You need to unzip the file first to
view the models. When reading the excel file, press ""F9"" to initiate

Today's focus: The PDA roundup

By Neal Weinberg

The Reviewmeister spends most of the year testing out heavy
duty networking gear. But with the holidays on the horizon, we
thought it would be appropriate to look into some tech tools
you might want to put on your holiday shopping list.

Our first category is the personal digital assistant (PDA). If
you're still using a Palm III, it's time for an upgrade.

Hewlett-Packard's Jornada 565 Pocket PC is an option. At $600,
this model features a color screen, is wireless-ready and has
new enterprise features such as VPN connectivity.

If you're looking for multimedia features, the Sony Clie PEG-
N610C lets you view color photos and movies, uses Memory Stick
for storage and costs about $400.

The Handspring Visor Pro, at $300, offers twice as much memory
as other Palm OS devices and the fastest processor. If you want
to put lots of applications on a PDA, buy this one.

If you're looking for a starter PDA for friends and relatives,
check out the Handspring Visor Neo, a $200 model that offers a
fast processor and the Springboard expansion slot for add-on
modules.

The @migo PD-600c Pocket PC is the only one with a PC Card
slot. It's great for wireless LAN cards, Bluetooth cards or
storage cards, and costs $500.

The best high-end Palm is the m505, a $450 model that comes
with a color screen and expansion slot for Secure Digital or
MultiMedia Cards. It's the Palm to have for the Palm junkie
(for the moment).

* PDA accessories

If you want to take your Palm wireless, check out the Xircom
wireless LAN module for Palm m500 series. At $300, it offers a
snap-on cradle that gives wireless LAN (802.11b) access to the
Palm m500 or m505.

How's this for an accessory: The $120 Akron Networks Parafone
PRF500 turns your Handspring Visor into a 900MHz cordless phone
for use around the house. Its charging stand doubles as a
HotSync cable.

The Seiko Thumboard, at $40, is a keyboard for Handspring
Visors, Palm V/Vx and m500 series. It snaps onto the PDA's sync
port, covering up the writing area.

Also check out the Acer Accufeel G300. For between  $40 and
$50, it's a keyboard that snaps onto a Palm V; best for use
with e-mail and long document inputs.

And for $75, there's the Belkin Pocket PDA Keyboard, a tiny
fold-out keyboard that is compatible with many different Palm
models (III, V, VII, m100) because of its ""PDA-One"" adapter.
With the adapter, it's a bit tricky to configure, but once it's
working, it's a pretty cool keyboard.

"Energy Club program","
Dear prospect sponsors: In behalf of the Rice MBA students interested in the Energy Industry I want to thank you for your interest in the Energy Club and present to you the club's program for the academic year 2001-2002.  We have a great number of opportunities and the attached program provides an overview of the topics for the academic year 2001-2002.  I would like to take this opportunity to present to you how the club intends to involve and educate the students' body on the Energy Industry, and I would also like to present the format we will use for this end. We have three levels that built one upon the other.  The first level is a general understanding of the Energy industry, (see Energy 101 event).  The second level it refers to the opportunities available for MBAs in the Energy industry, (see rest of the program), and the third will focus on the opportunities/profiles in demand now, (no identified yet).   The format is a roundtable presentation in which representatives from different companies bring they perspective and work experience, relative to the topic of the meeting.  Each roundtable has or will have a leader and moderator; the leader is responsible for organizing the event and it is your reference.  Please contact the person associated to the event if you are interested in participating in that specific roundtable. If there is no name feel free to e-mail me.  The Energy club heavily depends on your participation and your support will definitely bring value to all students in different ways.  You will also attract more talents, help students to take a better-informed decision with regard to the professional future, and establish a more intimate relationship, mutually beneficial for students and companies. Next step.  This coming Friday we are hosting the Energy 101 roundtable.  In this case the leader, Craig Parks, will have in the panel students with relevant work experience in the Energy Industry.  Please see the attached file if interested.  Next week I am going to submit the Program to all first and second year students, I aspect to have the list of the moderators by the end of the next week.  I will promptly notify all of you. If you are not interested in receiving further information about the Energy Club please e-mail me and I will withdraw your name from the list.  If you believe in this initiative an admiring comment is welcomed.  I will collect all your feedback and implement them if possible in this same academic year or leave them as guides for the next year. Thanks in advance for your support, Sincerely,  Luigi CalabresePresidentRice University Energy ClubJones Graduate School of Managementhttp://www.ruf.rice.edu/~luigical

Subject:	Boltzmann Model Demonstration from Toshiba in Tokyo
Importance:	High

Vince,

Enron Japan received a presentation today from a nuclear physicist working for Toshiba who has developed an application of the Boltzmann model to finance.  We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Group's Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html

Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.

Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them.

Mark Brady

"Newsletter","TheMarket for Lemons and the Price of Dishonesty 
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded thisyear to three economists: George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz and Michael Spence,who made significant contributions to modeling markets with information asymmetry.In many cases in a given market sellers or buyers may have exclusiveinformation that is not available to the counter party. The best-known examplecomes from the [paper by Akerlof, The Market for ""Lemons"": QualityUncertainty and the Market Mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84,(1970), pages 488-500.  
An owner of a used car can form a good idea of the qualityof his vehicle. He has much better information if his car is a lemon. As bothgood and bad used car have to sell at the same price - it is impossible for anaverage buyer to distinguish between good and bad merchandise - they sellers ofgood used cars are driven out of the market. Most traded used cars will belemons. Of course, there are ways to mitigate the problem: an owner of a goodused car may send signal to the buyer by offering him a guarantee or absorbingthe cost of inspection. 
Hiring is a similardecision. As Michael Spence wrote in his paper Job Market Signaling,Quarterly Journal of Economics, 87, (1973), pages 355 - 374, to hire somebodyis frequently to purchase a lottery ticket. The employer cannot directlyobserve the productivity of a potential hire. ""What he does observe is aplethora of personal data in the form of observable characteristics andattributes of the individual, and it is these that must ultimately determinehis assessment of the lottery he is buying."" The observable characteristics of an individual may be immutable (raceand, generally, sex) but in some cases certain attributes are alterable. A candidatecan modify such characteristics as education and job history. Some economistssay, tongue-in-cheek, that some candidates who attended top schools and spentmany painful hours studying useless subjects signal their willingness to dowhatever it takes to succeed. Another way to send a signal about one's qualityis to find a job with a top firm at the beginning of one's career and tosucceed in this firm before moving on. This provides a useful lesson to anybodywho plans to be in the labor market at some points in his or her life: thereputation of the current employer is critical to future employmentopportunities and should be defended at any cost. Honesty, at the end of theday, is an imperative dictated as much by morality as by one's self interest.

"EOL Pricing Algorithm Update","Hi

I've attached a couple of files summarizing our progress and current status on modeling the bid-ask spread.  The first summarizes characterization of the EOL Crude data and the second describes a bid-ask spread model based on options theory developed by Zimin (The figure from the paper is included separately).  I am now setting up an Excel spreadsheet to test this model with the EOL data.

Let me know when you would like to meet to review this.

Today's focus: How much is too much?

By Jeb Bolding

In October I talked about Relera, which at that time, announced
that it was getting out of the managed-services business.
Before it made the announcement I visited its Internet data
center in Denver and what comes to my mind when I think about
the discussion I had with its CEO, and my impression of the
facilities is one word: scale.

Everything was about having the best partners, the biggest data
center, massive systems redundancy rates, etc. No doubt, there
is a place for that corporate mentality, and Relera's focus on
scale should be a comfort to many enterprise companies. Relera
may have just been unfortunate with its timing in the market
and it may yet be successful with its focus.

As a counterpoint, yesterday I visited another local Internet
data center provider, Inflow. Like Relera, Inflow is
headquartered in Denver, and like Relera, it is focused at
second-tier cities such as Nashville and Minneapolis, though it
does have some first-tier city locations.

The similarities, in my opinion, end there. Inflow's corporate
esprit de corps seems to revolve around ""smaller is better.""

As an example, the data centers are smaller, somewhere between
20,000 and 30,000 square feet. Not only does this bring data
center profitability sooner based upon allocated space, but it
also gives, in the words of Inflow executives, a more personal
touch to the relationship between the data-center managers and
Inflow's customers.

Further to this point, instead of effectively building its own
substations, Inflow ensures that each of its data centers
(there are three in Denver) are located on different power
grids. While this may not put you in complete control over your
own destiny, it's a reasonable, and cost-efficient solution
based upon the statistical likelihood of a disaster.

While Inflow's costs are considerably less, the features of its
facilities do not appear to be diminished.

All data centers are mirror images of one another (other than
the square footage), so that a customer walking into a
Nashville facility will be just as at home in a Denver center.

All the services, from simple co-location, to managed security
services and monitoring, are replicated similarly across the
various locations.

And your single operational account representative is your
focal service point regardless of how many Inflow data centers
you're in. Management is fully integrated between the data
centers so that your customer representative does not have to
be local to your issues in order to solve them.

No doubt, there is a place in the business world for Relera and
Inflow. Inflow may have just lucked out that its focus on costs
will help the company better weather a long downturn.

"Work Update","Vasant,

A quick update on a number of on-going projects:

1.  JCC Forward Curve/Hedging Strategy (Enron Japan)

h  An update of the historical P&L model was completed and included both commodity and foreign exchange risks.  The standard deviation of historical simulations for single month swaps was significantly reduced with the foreign exchange hedging strategy (two long yen/$ positions and 1 short yen/$ position).  

h  Enron Japan, in cooperation with Enron London, developed an alternative hedging strategy based on Brent $ value.  No P&L historical P&L simulations were conducted for the alternative strategy.

h  The original Brent hedge ratios were based on an average of 3 monthly preliminary JCC values offered by METI.  Presumably, the swap will be settled off of the finalized METI JCC price which is released two months after the fact.  Rousseau forwarded those numbers from 1998 to present this morning.  Unfortunately, our model uses historical JCC values going back to August 1991.  Rousseau will hopefully obtain the required historical JCC time series early next week.

h  I haven't yet heard about Jeff Shankman's response to the memo that was forwarded on Wednesday.

2.  Ethanol Forward Curve (Enron Global Markets)   

h  A meeting was held with Marc de la Roche, Darren Maloney, and Sanjay Patel to discuss the development of a forward curve for ethanol.  A first-cut curve based on NYMEX unleaded gasoline, NYMEX WTI crude, and EIA fuel ethanol inventories was constructed and backtested.  Rolling monthly backtesting (using data from 2000 to 2001) suggested that, on average, the modeled and actual ethanol prices were off only by a few cents for time periods up to 6 months (e.g., 6 month swap).  Unfortunately, the 1 SD value for the historical projections was quite large (+/- $0.30 on a $1.40/gal commodity).  

h The changing dynamics of the ethanol market offer the greatest challenge to forward curve construction.  That is, ethanol will likely replace MTBE as the fuel oxygenate of choice over time, which will probably signal a stronger relationship with unleaded gas price.  Unfortunately, the current model uses historical data from 1998 to present which do not necessarily reflect such a strong relationship.  These concerns have been noted to the ethanol guys.

h  The ENE ethanol pricing index has been updated with August, September, and October prices and continues to generally track other industry publication values (e.g., Oxy-fuel news).  

h  Marc and Darren are in talks with Petrous as a potential counterparty for an ethanol swap.

h  An ethanol status meeting will be held Wednesday or Thursday of next week with Randy Maffett.

3.  Plastics Forward Curves (Enron Global Markets)

h  Mauricio Mora and I have focused on the development of forward curves for a suite of plastics including propylene, ethylene, polypropylene, HDPE, and LLDPE (see earlier email for details).

h  Initial models for each of these plastics have been completed and will be compared to the current model forward curves and Alan Engberg's expected values.  Alan did forward the most recent curves and personal outlooks to us today.  

h  Note that the methologies behind the creation of the old forward curves are not known.  Evidently, one can use various rankings (say 1 to 5 depending on market conditions) to manipulate the model forward curve--I don't know whether regression was involved in these forward curve constructions.

4.  Butadiene-Natural Gasoline Hedge (Enron Energy Services)

h  A request was made to EGM Fundamentals by Trey Comiskey (Industrial Services origination) to develop hedge ratios in natural gasoline to offset a position in butadiene.  The request was forwarded to Research.

h  Stationarity tests and cointegration and regression analyses were conducted on the two series.  The two series could not be cointegrated and the R2 on the differences model was roughly 37%.  Note that there appears to be little month-to-month movement in the historical butadiene series back to 1996.  Analysis of a more recent time series might offer better results--I am also not sure why natural gasoline was selected as the hedge commodity.

h  Trey was contacted to discuss the results of the analysis.

5.  Emissions Technology Investment/Clean Air Solutions (Enron Global Markets)

h  An informal meeting was held with Vince Middleton, Scott Affelt, and Reese Soares (Coal Desk/Clean Air Solutions Group) to discuss a pilot-scale emissions reduction technology evaluation with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).  The group is nearing completion of the testing with potential full-scale implementation of the technology at a number of sites.

h  One of the effluents exiting the system (fly ash) is being discharged into a holding pond.  The holding pond water is exhibiting high levels of nitrogen and the TVA has proposed that treatment of the ponds (9 total) will cost $9 million, half of which will be paid by Enron. 

h  The group has asked me to contact the TVA engineers directly to discuss possible treatment options and to see if costs may be further minimized.  No information has yet been forwarded to me.

6.  Textiles Cross-Selling (Enron Energy Services)

h  A meeting was held with Jay Sparling (Industrial Services) and Rodney Derbigny to discuss cross-selling opportunities to the textiles sector.  The initial purpose of the meeting was to discuss the intricacies of Enron's agricultural effort given that cotton is a key feedstock in this industry.

h  The focus of the discussion shifted to cross-selling opportunities and the suite of products currently being offered by Enron.  We discussed most of the EGM commodities (e.g., diesel fuel, weather derivatives, plastics, truck freight capacity) with an eye toward perhaps bringing some of the parties together at some point in the near future.  In the near term, the most likely cross-selling candidate would be diesel fuel swaps for the trucking fleet.

7.  Traffic Volume Analysis (Enron Freight Markets)

h  Pravas Sud continues to work part-time on analyzing the DataPave database traffic studies with a goal of developing some understanding of freight volume throughout a given year.  

h  The construction of the dataset using the information sent by SAIC has been extremely difficult.  In conjunction with IT, we have had to reconstruct the data series multiple times.  

h  Data for the I-10 corridor from Houston to Los Angeles and the I-5 corridor from Sacramento to Seattle constitute the initial routes to be investigated.  Several testing points in each state are located along the routes and 5-axle and above traffic volume will be evaluated for monthly and daily trends (1998 data only).

8.  Propane Demand Model (Enron Global Markets) 

h  Sarah Wooddy has completed the US propane monthly demand model and forwarded the results to EGM Fundamentals for inclusion into a larger model for Lee Jackson.  She has conducted backtesting analysis on the monthly data and also forwarded this information to Fundamentals to give them a sense of model error.  

h  Propane demand modeling work will continue to meet the requests of the Weather Research Group.

9.  Heating Oil Demand Model (Enron Global Markets)

h  Shalesh Ganjoo is continuing to work on monthly heating oil demand for the PADD 1 states.  The monthly models for Connecticut and Maine have been completed (note that time series were checked for stationarity prior to modeling).

h  The short-term goal for this work is the completion of monthly demand models for all of PADD 1 by the end of next week.  We concluded that it would be best to finish up the monthly models for the entire PADD before embarking on the daily model analysis.  

10.  Pulp and Paper Forward Curves (Enron Industrial Markets)

h  Week-to-week discussions have been held with Maria Theresa Aguilera-Peon (EIM Fundamentals) on pulp and paper forward curves.  She is currently beginning work on a pulp forward curve.

Subject:	Market Forecasting Conference

Hi Vince,

It been awhile since we have spoken, hope all has been going great for
you.

I left a voice message on this conference subject with you.  We want to
invite you to speak at our conference.

Thought you might like to take a look at the preliminary agenda so I am
attaching that to this email.

This is the fourth year of our conference.  It has grown in quality and
attendance each year.  The conference is held at Skamania lodge, which
is about 45 minutes from the Portland airport.

Basically, we expect an attendance of about 70-80 individuals from the
US and Canada.  We get a broad spectrum of attendance both
geographically and functionally.  It is an excellent opportunity for
networking and building knowledge about electric markets.  All of the
presentations are very well attended.

We strive also for a broad spectrum of high quality speakers.  Many have
no relation with EPIS, we simply are looking for the best speakers we
can find.  We have a high respect for you and know that you would
greatly add to the value of our conference.  It has always been a
pleasure to work with you in the past.  For this conference, we would
consult with you to develop a speaking topic that would fit with your
desires and with our program.

As a speaker, your conference fees would be handled by us.  And the
conference fees include all meals except one dinner.  You would handle
the travel and hotel.

We also provide some opportunity for relaxation with a catered
reception/dinner at the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center, which
overlooks the gorge and is filled with great history and information
about the spectacular gorge, and on the second evening an informal/fun
golf tournament (included in the conference fees) for those who are
interested.

We hope that you would give this your consideration, and we look forward
to hearing from you.

Thanks

Warren

"Cash needs","Vince,

I was thinking that max (negative)  potential exposure for different counterparties could occur for different scenarios and so combining max potential exposure across counterparties may overstate cash needs.

If overall scenario for overall max (negative) potential exposure is considered, then we will pick up some high exposures and some low exposures, which may be fine.

Alternately, why not tweak the potential exposure program to do deterministic shifts of one sigma and two sigma and assuming one factor model and perfect correlation across commodities.
Then the negative mtm values can be compared to collateral already outstanding.
This method does not guarantee that we will get large exposures, but is easy to explain.

Another thing to check with Winston is that the program does not automatically zero out negative exposures. If it does, then we may have to flip the sign for all positions, get the exposures, then flip back the sign. Then compare to collateral outstanding.

I plan to  present the agenda to the companies interested once I get the feedbacks from  Vincent and the club's officers.   Regarding MGMT 669, I was thinking to extend the possibility to take  this course to the first year interested.  Let me know if you think is a good  idea or not.

Subject: RE: Rice Energy Club Roundtable  topics
 
Luigi,
 
As to  topics, I'd suggest working on the following for the rest of the  year:
 
1)  Energy 101 (can be accomplished by taking either of the MGMT 669 sections --  the Thursday night section will be more lecture based, the Tuesday  night section will have less lecture but more guest speakers and student  presentations)
2)  Energy Consulting
3)   Financial Services (trading, risk management)
4)  Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) 
5)  Project Development, strategic planning
6)  Structuring of Products
7)  Supply Chain
8)  Venture Capital within energy industry 
9)  Geo-Political considerations
 
You are  on the right track getting companies involved. Typical groupings would  be:
1)  Utilities (e.g. Reliant)
2) Gas,  Pipeline, & Trading (e.g. Enron, El Paso Energy)
3) Oil  Products (retail arm of Shell, Exxon, etc.)
4)  Exploration & Production (Shell, Exxon, Apache, etc.)
5)  Chemicals (majors like Shell, Exxon, but also Lyondell, Du Pont,  etc.)
6)  Oilfield services (Halliburton, Schlumberger, Core Lab, BJ Services,  Weatherford, etc.)

Subject:  Rice Energy Club Roundtable topics
Dear John, dear  Vincent,
 
Let me up-date  you on the roundtables we decided in the last meeting to focus on during the  rest of the academic year.  The  original idea was to keep the number of events from 3 to 4 roundtables each  semester.  The result of the last  meeting with all members was driven by enthusiasm, and as you see below we  produced a prolific list of 13 subjects.   Maybe you can help us to narrow down to a reasonable number, 12 events  (one we had yesterday) by May 2002 we think are too many. 
 
I also would take  this opportunity to update on the ongoing relationships with the most  prominent industry in the sectors and have your feedback, suggestion on how to  group them in the roundtable.
We got great  support so far from Reliant, Enron, Mirant, Schell (Coral), Bp, Duke.   El Paso, Chevron-Texaco,  Phillips, and Halliburton etc.. also are interested and we will present the  club to them as well.  The major  challenge for us is not transform the Energy Club in a Finance Energy  Club.  At Rice we already have a  Finance club and it works very well.   We want first educate about the energy industry in general, and second  present the opportunities for MBAs in the industry in different areas,  including finance but not limited to.
 
Topics  of Roundtable Meetings:
 
0)  Energy ""101"" 
1)  Corporate Finance (Treasurer or Controller)
2)  Energy Consulting
3)  Financial Services (trading, risk management)
4)  Origination, Marketing and Sales (Oil, Gas, Electricity) -  Marteen
5)  Project Development, strategic planning
6)  Project Finance
7)  Project Risk Management
8)  Regulation, Deregulation, and Restructuring - Reliant done  9/17/2001
9)  Structuring of Products
10)  Supply Chain
11)  Telecom - Broadband
12)  Venture Capital within energy industry - Brian, Paresh
 
Thanks  in advance for your precious suggestions and I am looking forward to meeting  you.

"EGM Charges for Avistar","Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product","Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.  

Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would feature similar assets and services.
SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers that comprise each segment. 
The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried from PCCS.
The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly.
Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real estate segment.


  


Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.

Thanks.

Richard

"Referred by Mark Kierlanczyk","
Vince,
 
I am an ex-Enron that was part of the ""cost cutting  measures"" implemented in early December.  One of the people I have spoken  during my job search is Mark Kierlanczyk from AON.  Mark suggested you  might be someone I could contact and talk to briefly about my job  search.
 
In general terms, I am looking for a job in finance  or structuring with an international company.  My ideal job would be one  that involved a mix of finance and origination for an international energy or  petroleum company, however I am very flexible.  Obviously, the market is  not real strong right now, especially in Houston, but I was hoping to ask  you if you have some ideas of how I might best proceed.
 
I am sure you are quite busy, but I would welcome a  moment to talk to when you have a couple of minutes.  (I have enclosed a  copy of my resume just to let you know where I have been...)
 
Many thanks,

"RE: longitude","Thank you, Joe. If they include combinatorial bids then it would be a much more complicated system. I think everything comes down to liquidity. If they have enough volume, then it will attract even more bidders because the bidders do not have to think too much about the ""fair"" price because they will always get the lowest successful price anyway. If there is small volume, then it will become harder for the bidders to decide on optimal bidding strategy. Personally I think this system will work because there are many speculators out there who want to play this kind of games.

Subject:	RE: longitude

Chonawee,

	Good work. I'd like to add a few observations. Regarding your comment about not being able to buy straddles:  Longitude informed us that an upcoming implementation (that is actually in place now but has not been made available so as not to complicate the initial auctions). The new implementation allows packages of digital spreads to be bought and sold as one instrument, resulting in terraced payout functions that approximate true call and put (and presumably collar and straddle) payouts. Even so, the structures will remain largely digital in nature; therefore, they will be rather dirty hedges for traditional calls and puts regardless of how one packages them

	As far as getting a bad price, the auctions here are indeed Dutch auctions, but I believe that the limit orders address this issue -- they assure a given payout ratio. Certainly there is no guarantee that any of the amount laid down by a participant will be placed, which is another problem for hedgers. (Then again, a traditional hedger who asks too much for his offsetting transaction is also unlikely to meet with success.)

	Lastly, with regard to the last paragraph on publishing tentative prices, it is left up to to the discretion of market maker to decide how much of the auction's internal operations (including tentative prices) is posted, but remember that the auction is intended to last only a few hours at a time, yet again constraining the auction's suitability for hedging (admittedly, there would likely be several auctions throughout the life-cycle of the underlying index). 

Joe

I will be back on Wednesday night. You guys can reach me at my cell phone 713-320-5473.

Attached please find a paper I wrote earlier (before we discuss with them this afternoon) about the longitude. 
(Vince, I already gave you a hardcopy of it earlier.. in case you wants a softcopy)

As Vasant pointed out, it looks like they already did the real-time tentative prices posting in their system. So now hedgers can participate in the auctions. I still feel that the system will attract speculators more.

Thanks!

Oh, the Games Enron Played 
In the 1990s, Houston's Enron Corp. was Wall Street's darling. It had  thrown out the energy-industry playbook, remaking itself from a staid gas  pipeline company to a high-tech trading firm that created exotic securities for  betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in  summer.
Share prices soared from $30 to $90 between 1998 and 2000, as  sales increased from $31 billion to more than $100 billion. Enron executives  gained reputations as the energy industry's visionaries.
This fall it all  came apart. Share prices have fallen by 90% this year, including a plunge from  just below $40 to less than $10 this fall. In October, Enron reported a  third-quarter loss of $618 million. The company's massive debt was downgraded to  near junk-bond status, and the CEO and CFO were expelled. Shareholders sued and  the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an  investigation.
Finally, the humiliated company, which employs more than  20,000, agreed Nov. 9 to be taken over by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc.  for about $9 billion in stock and $13 billion in assumed debt. It is not certain  the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could  be blocked on antitrust grounds. And some news accounts suggest that major  Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting  liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders.
The  Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got  burned. Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the  dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are  available to most publicly traded companies. Companies like Enron can legally  conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiary's  balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it.
""If  I'm a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure, I would want  information about the entities Enron controls,"" says Wharton accounting  professor Robert E. Verrecchia. Yet Enron shareholders have never received such  a report.
Enron's fate is crucial to the energy industry and other  markets it serves, points out Paul R. Kleindorfer, a professor of public policy  and an expert on deregulation at Wharton. Producers and users of gas, oil,  electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enron's system for trading  futures, forwards, options, swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and  control costs far into the future. Without such a system, deregulation simply  cannot work.
""If Enron's trading platform were to go down it would not be  a minor loss,"" Kleindorfer says. ""It would be a huge loss for the industry?.In  the early 1990s the company single-handedly produced the backbone infrastructure  that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation.""
To some  extent, Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and  volatile energy costs in 2000 and 2001, and it has lost hundreds of millions by  laying fiber-optic cable for which there is no demand. But although those  factors may have determined the timing of the company's troubles, they were not  the chief cause. Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder  money by gambling at its own roulette wheels.
""In hindsight, we made some  very bad investments in non-core businesses that performed worse than we ever  could have conceived,"" Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week.
How  did Enron get into this mess?
Becoming a Market Maker
When  it was created in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth,  parent company of Northern Natural Gas, Enron's chief business was the operation  of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline. Lay became chairman in Feb. 1986.  Then early in the 1990s, the federal government took key steps to deregulate the  energy industry.
Previously, large regulated utilities were vertically  integrated, giving them control from wellhead to consumer, Kleindorfer says.  Deregulation effectively broke apart the production, long-range transmission and  local distribution functions, leaving each to a different set of players. A  factory owner, for example, can now buy gas or electricity from number of  producers.
To function, a free market such as this needs brokers, or  intermediaries, to create, buy and sell contracts for production and delivery,  and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading, just as the big Wall  Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks. Enron created that  marketplace. ""This intermediation activity, or brokerage activity, just  revolutionized the marketplace,"" Kleindorfer says.
Since utilities and  other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the  future, they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities, prices  and delivery dates. But before the commodity is delivered, prevailing prices may  go up or down, and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price that's  now too low, while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than  it had agreed to pay.
Suppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of  derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge  in case prices move against them. A company that has contracted to buy a  shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months, could,  for a much smaller sum, buy an options contract giving it the right, but not the  obligation, to buy a shipload at a lower price. And it could buy an option  giving it the right to sell at a higher price. Thus it is protected regardless  of whether prices move up or down.
This was the business Enron invented.  By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future, it brought to  the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict  and stabilize costs far into the future, Kleindorfer says. ""Having that  information historically, as well as projected into the future, could  revolutionize how you plan your business,"" he said. 
At the heart of  Enron's business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player  without owning all the power plants, ships, pipelines and other facilities  involved. Instead, it could use contracts to control the facilities in which  other companies had invested, says Ehud Ronn, director of the Center for Energy  Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the  University of Texas at Austin. The Center trains masters candidates in the use  of energy securities. (Enron is one of the center's eight corporate  sponsors.)
Enron, he says, evolved into something akin to a Wall Street  firm. ""Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker  that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible.""
By 2001, Enron had  evolved into a market maker for some 1,800 different products, many of them  energy- or Internet-related contracts or derivatives the company had created  itself. They included products allowing customers to buy, sell, hedge or  speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal, oil, gas  and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth, pollution  emissions, semiconductors, wind energy and many others. Prices for many of these  products were available on the company's free website, giving the energy markets  unprecedented price transparency.
Betting on the Weather
To  see how these products could be used, consider one of Enron's ""weather risk  management"" products meant for utilities, energy distributors, agricultural  companies and financial institutions. A gas utility, for example, might use a  ""floor"" to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter. In exchange for a  premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy, Enron will compensate the  utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises  above a set level. The payments would make up for reduced gas sales.
In  another form of contract called a swap, or collar, Enron will pay the gas  company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level. But if  the number of cold days exceeds a threshold, the gas company will make a  payment to Enron. The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with  the floor, and if it had to pay Enron, the money would come from the extra  revenue received by selling more gas in a colder-than normal winter.
To a  layman this might look like betting. ""We never use that word,"" says Ronn. ""The  worst we say is to 'have a view.'""
In practice, other parties are often  involved in such transactions, taking over the contractual obligation created by  Enron. So, in addition to placing its own bets, Enron serves as a middleman, the  way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade.
Like many  middlemen, Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should  either party default. Otherwise, it would be hard to make a market in these  products. In addition, says Ronn, Enron often has to pay out money before  receiving payment from another party. Finally, Enron needed large amounts of  capital to trade products in its own account, just as a Wall Street firm invests  in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers' trades. To accomplish  all this, Enron needed vast amounts of capital. ""You do need to have liquidity  in huge numbers,"" Ronn says.
This created a dilemma. A public company can  raise capital by selling additional shares, but current shareholders don't like  that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings. The alternative  is to borrow, but large debts hurt a company's credit rating, forcing it to pay  higher interest rates on its loans.
Andrew S. Fastow, who became the  company's senior vice president of finance in 1990, found innovative ways to  issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling old-fashioned  assets like power plants and pipelines.
""He has invented a groundbreaking  strategy,"" Ted. A. Izatt, senior vice president at Lehman Brother's Inc., told  CFO Magazine in the fall of 1999. Or, as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey  K. Skilling told the magazine: ""We needed someone to rethink the entire  financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts. We didn't want someone stuck in  the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the  intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every  accolade tossed his way.""
Fastow, named chief financial officer in March  1998, told the magazine: ""We transformed finance into a merchant  organization?.Essentially, we would buy and sell risk positions."" A key to the  strategy: Move many of Enron's transactions ""off the balance sheet."" In part,  this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting  regulations. As noted earlier, debts accumulated by subsidiaries, partnerships  or other ""entities"" can be kept off the parent company's books so long as the  parent does not own more than 50% of the entity incurring the debt.
By  using so-called unconsolidated subsidiaries, ""you do not make transparent either  the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the  subsidiary,"" said Verrecchia. Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and  major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional  information on subsidiaries. ""But if you're just an investor picking up Enron's  annual report, you are stuck,"" Verrecchia added.
A Pattern of Sketchy  Details 
It has long been clear from company statements and SEC  filings that Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions were enormous, but details  were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them, and chose not to. By  this fall, however, it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks  when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books.  Putting those debts and losses into Enron's financial statements last month  meant reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Corrected statements reduced  net income by $96 million for 1997, $113 million for 1998, $250 million for 1999  and $132 million for 2000.
At issue were so-called ""special purpose  entities,"" or SPEs, set up for a variety of transactions for Enron's benefit.  Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to  be kept off of Enron's books. In one case, for instance, the entity had  ""inadequate capitalization"" for such treatment.
In 2000, Enron had  created four entities known as Raptor I, II, III and IV to ""hedge market risk in  certain of its investments,"" according to an Enron filing with the SEC. Enron  acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to  issue Enron shares to the entities. But Enron had improperly included the value  of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the  shares it would have to issue. In correcting this violation of accounting rules,  Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by $1 billion in March and  June 2001.
Enron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two  special purpose entities, limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM Co-Investment,  had Fastow as the managing partner. Fastow, who according to Enron made in  excess of $30 million in this role, was forced out of the company in October. An  internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the  partnerships.
Obviously, Fastow's role was a problem. If the partnerships  were truly independent entities, he was in a conflict of interest. If he was  running them on Enron's behalf, they were not independent.
Despite the  write-downs and disclosures this fall, many analysts complain they still do not  have a full picture of Enron's activities. Enron, for instance, has not fully  described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance  sheet. Nor is it clear to what extent Enron's losses are due to bad bets it had  made through highly-leveraged derivatives. While a stock market investor can  simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn, options and other derivatives  typically have expiration dates. If the bet has not turned out as hoped, the  entire investment can be lost.
""New disclosure was modest and management  did not resolve concerns,"" Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David  Fleischer wrote in an Oct. 24 report to clients. Though Enron had long faced  such criticisms, investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the  doubt ""because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry  leading capabilities?,"" the two analysts said.
In other words, when stock  was soaring, investors didn't require details on how it was done. Now they are  crying foul, and a number of shareholder suits have been filed. Essentially,  they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial  statements. Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge  losses.
For years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets  accounting rules, has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of  subsidiaries' activities and numbers. Essentially, it would move toward a more  qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if  it owned less than 50% of the stock. Control could be exerted by holding board  seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the  parent.
""What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible,""  Verrecchia said, noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an  accurate view of a company's inner workings and true earnings. To conceal  obligations, risk and debt, as Enron and others do, undermines that goal, he  said.
But, facing heavy opposition from accountants and corporations, the  FASB has not acted on the draft proposal, citing insufficient support on its  board. So for the time being, off-balance-sheet transactions will continue to be  a common practice among American corporations.

There are more risk takers than risk diversified people. So I think speculators might be our customers in this movie business.

Subject:	Re: HSX volume info   

Thanks, Key, for the volume information. Because HSX is a fake market, I think this indicates that there are lots of speculators out there in the movie trading business. So I believe ""speculators"" might be one of our major customers. (Like stock markets, a (big?) part of brokers' profits are from speculators' commissions.)

I know the ""diversification"" is a good thing to do but may be hard to do in reality. Even for myself, who is working for Enron and owning Enron shares, I would not buy Dynergy stocks even if it makes sense to do that for reducing my unique risk...  In stead, I buy Enron shares, so I am a speculator (risk taker) myself... 

Regarding moral-hazzard/information-asymmetry issue in the movie business, the market price will reflect this risk. In addition, I think we can 1) try not taking any position or 2) have a diversified portfolio of movies. 

If we operate as a broker and maintain balanced books, one question is how much we have to invest to create these markets... Thin margin can help generate volume.

Subject:	Re: HSX volume info   

Key - Interesting information.  Personally, I am blown away by the large membership HSX claims.   Even if they have a decent percentage of these numbers, that would suggest that movies and the related industry is becoming sport as well as entertainment.  I guess the fact that you can already find on the front page of your newspaper such information as weekend box office receipts suggests that a lot of people really are interested in movies beyond the content.  Could bode well for us...

FYI,

Spoke VP sales from HSX:  I posed as being interested in advertising on the site (keep in mind for perspective on info)

750k registered users
80k active users at any time
40k trades per day
each user visit averages about 37 minutes with 41 page turns
HSX.Com is primarily a B2C platform
Primary visitors - young people interested in the entertainment aspect and virtual stock exchange competition aspects of the site

But - 

HSXresearch.Com is a B2B site designated to provide information to industry players  
The concept behind the B2B site is provide industry players with insight into consumer perception:  exert from press release:

     HSX Research's primary application, HSX Trader Insight, consists of six dynamic reports that provide clients with long-lead estimates of audience awareness, intention and box office projecting for all film projects. Future applications, such as advertising effectiveness analysis, product placement analysis, entertainment product indexing and other value-added market research services will be available later this year.   	

It does make me think that if you visit the B2B site, you are likely to visit the trading site and be aware of it if nothing else.  And the volume of trades is a lot higher than I had thought => although it's just for fun.


regards,

Key

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

"Prospective hire","
Dear Vince
I know that you are always looking for good  prospective hires so I am bringing this to your attention. Armando Ugarte who is  a former Ph.D. student of mine is currently working for i2 in Texas but told me  recently that he is considering a career move. Armando has a very interesting  background combining excellent training in economics and operations research  with extensive practical experience in IT working as software architect and  application developer for HP, Oracle and i2. I know Armando for over 14 years  since his undergraduate studies in our department and was always fascinated by  his broad spectrum of talents and experience. I am enclosing his resume. I do  not exactly know what his immediate plans are and if he has already another job  lined up. He told me ,however , that he would like to make better use of his  education. He took the job at i2 after deciding, for personal reasons, to  repatriate from Colombia where he held a faculty position. I highly recommend  him as a hard worker, solid and mature researcher and a very likable person. If  you are interested you should contact him directly. His contact info is on his  resume.

"Energy Executive Committee","Vince,

	As you have seen in the write-ups I have been sending you, we have
established the Energy Markets Institute here to provide a world class
recruitment, specialized training, and research resource for the energy
industry.  The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as
possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up
an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable
resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global
Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth
(Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly
(Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on
the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired,
Shell Oil).

	Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a
leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the
industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would
be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to
organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it
may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7
p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you
would agree to be on the Committee.

	We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance
for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).  I also want to discuss any
suggestion you may have on people we should be trying to recruit for this.

"First rotation","
Hi Vincent:
 
Super Saturday is coming and I am so happy to move toward the end of the recruiting process.  During the interviews that I have had so far, I expressed my desire to have my first rotation in your group.  Last spring I really enjoyed the work environment and the people I met.  I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.
 
On another note, Jason gave me two names for the Energy Club.  I will contact them shortly after finals next week.
 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you again.

More efficient and quantitative than an MBA specialization in Finance, and more advanced than any available executive education course, the Financial Investment Technology (F.I.T.) program offers attendees an extraordinary opportunity to learn and apply the latest advances in financial theory and practice. The course will be held at the Haas School of Business on the U.C. Berkeley campus from January 7th to February 1st, 2002.
  To view a quick presentation about the upcoming F.I.T. program click on the URL below, or paste this URL into your browser's address bar:http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/finance/FIT/presentation 
All thirteen members of the world-renowned finance faculty of the Haas School of Business teach the F.I.T. program. Most professors will teach their particular specialty and several, where relevant, their current research. In years past, the original research presented is now summarized in current textbooks. With these professors, you will spend quality, live-in learning time mastering the techniques of modern quantitative finance.
The program is presented in two sequential, two-week terms entitled ""Derivatives Modeling and Implementation"" and ""Dynamic Asset Management and Trading Strategies"". These two segments make for an integrated package, but you can choose either one separately. 
 The F.I.T. program is intended for senior implementers, line managers, and strategists in asset management, investment banking, trading, enterprise-wide risk management, and corporate strategic planning. 
 You can contact the program coordinator, Johanna Della Valle  (please put 'FIT' in the subject line) via email or phone (510) 642-0114.
We hope to see you in January.

"Natural Gas--No Help from Demand: Difficult Time in the North American Gas Market  - CERA Watch","
Title: Quarterly Natural Gas Watch: A Shortage of Demand
URL(s):

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2789;


***********************************************************************

NO HELP FROM DEMAND: DIFFICULT TIME IN THE NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET

Since January, natural gas prices have fluctuated between $2.00 per MMBtu at
the Henry Hub and $10.00, a result of weather, fuel switching, and increasing
supplies. Loss of demand due to economic weakness is exacerbated by the impact
of the tragedy of September 11. Lower prices have already slowed drilling
activity. Although ample storage levels will guard against last year's peaks,
gas prices will likely to continue to oscillate in the near term.

* The US gas supply rebound expected after record drilling rates is now
unlikely. CERA expects only modest production increases for 2001 and a year-
over-year decline for 2002.

* CERA has analyzed two paths for demand recovery depending on the severity and
length of the economic downturn. Generally, the large overbuild of gas-fired
generating plants and the recovery of industrial demand should cause much of
the lost demand to return in 2002.

Dear Vince
 
Further to my telephone conversation with Shirley,  I am writing concerning the GARP 2002 Convention, which will be held in New York  on 12-13 February. I have set a new deadline for the presentational slides,  Friday 4th January, and would like to touch base with you about  this. Your two areas of participation are:
 
1. a 40 minute presentation in 12th February on  Measuring energy risk - tackling price volatility, adapting VAR,  scenario modelling and regulatory requirements
 
2. co-presenting a one-day workshop on energy risk  management with Mark Williams on 14 February. I have attached a copy of the  brochure for your information.
 
I have also attached a hotel booking form, since I  am unsure whether this was sent to you.
 
Please keep me informed as to your progress, though  I hope to receive the presentational slides by January 4. If there are any  difficulties or questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

Dear Wincenty Kaminski:  Translating strategy into action is a challenge that managers like us face every day. In today's unpredictable climate, you may find that traditional financial  measures don't always provide a complete picture of where your company  is -- and where it needs to go to succeed.  We need to be able to filter the corporate vision down to specific performance measurements that can be used to mobilize the entire organization.   Enter the Balanced Scorecard.  Beginning with their seminal article in ""Harvard Business Review,"" ""The Balanced Scorecard -- Measures that Drive Performance,"" Robert Kaplan and David Norton  have provided a powerful measurement *and* management tool that has  revolutionized how hundreds of companies -- from Chrysler to Hewlett-Packard to  Barclay's Bank -- evaluate and improve their businesses.  ************************************************* Put the Balanced Scorecard to the Test --  Satisfaction Guaranteed *************************************************  Now I'd like to invite you to try ""Measuring Corporate Performance,"" a special package created here at Harvard Business School Publishing to help  your organization benefit from the Balanced Scorecard, with a 100% money-back  satisfaction guarantee.  This program offers you and your team the fastest and most effective way to get up to speed on the tools and techniques of the Balanced Scorecard. Use it and  you'll:  * Develop a framework and specific steps to manage strategic performance and measure results;  * See how to achieve breakthrough improvements in critical areas such as product, process, customer, and market development; and  * Discover techniques to overcome obstacles to your success.   ************************************************* YOU CAN PUT THE BALANCED SCORECARD  TO WORK RIGHT AWAY *************************************************  Start with ""The Balanced Scorecard"" video. It provides an overview and takes you and your team behind the scenes at companies that have successfully used these  techniques.  Then use the ""Balancing the Corporate Scorecard"" interactive CD-ROM business simulation to get hands-on experience using the Balanced Scorecard in an  engaging, no-risk environment.

Victoria,  
I can cover the presentation on Day 2, Integrating Market Risk and  Credit Risk. ""The Demise of Enron"" is a bit risky, given that this drama is  still unfolding and the legal ramifications are still uncertain. Maybe you can  change the topic to ""Energy Markets: Is There Life after Enron?"" The person  who can cover this topic is either Richard Stavros or Mark Hand. They have  recently published articles in ""Public Utilities Fortnightly"" on this topic --  they are both editors working for this magazine. If you cannot locate these  articles, I can fax you the copies.

"Western Energy--Winter Demand Peaks Not Expected to Result in Price Spikes or Reliability Problems - CERA Monthly Briefing","
Title: One Tight Winter Peak Remains
URL(s):

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2760;


***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--WINTER DEMAND PEAKS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PRICE SPIKES OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS

Building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western
energy markets for this winter. Although seasonal gas and power demand spikes
will again push prices higher, this winter will not look like the winter of
2000/01. Unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last
year winter, reduced demand, increased gas storage levels, and new gas and
power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the
risk of supply disruptions.

*  A supply build of 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the Rockies and
900 MMcf in western Canada is meeting with declining demand in the West

*  Fourth quarter power demand is expected to be 13 percent below levels last
year, while over 5,000 megawatts of new supply has been added this year

*  Only severe cold weather, prolonged drought, or a supply disruption could
produce a reliability problem this winter

To whom it may concern: 
I would appreciate if you could forward to the editors my formal complaint regarding 
the behavior of one of the reporters working for your organization. 
Complaint 
My name is Vince Kaminski and I was quoted by Ms. Kristen Hays in her 
article on Enron (the link is provided below). Her behavior represents in my view a 
violation of ethical standards that every journalist should observe. 
I did not talk to Ms. Hays. She did not ask me any questions. She 
might have been the lady sitting at my table at the luncheon and she 
may have overheard bits and pieces of conversation I had with my 
friend. I shall be glad to submit the name of a witness who was talking to me  
and sitting next to me through the entire meeting and who walked out with me from 
the building. 
I am not sure if an organization of your reputation can tolerate similar 
questionable practices of collecting information. Eavesdropping on a 
private conversation is not an acceptable behavior in a civilized 
society. If you would like to endorse such behavior, you should 
provide Ms. Hays with a hearing aid. Yahoo - Analyst: Enron Crash a 'Morality Tale'

"RE: Models and Data from the Loan Pricing Corporation (A Reuters Company)","

Hi,

	Today I met with John Dowling - a Vice President  of the Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC) .  LPC may present another potential set of options for ECT's data and/or public and private firm models needs.

	More specifically, John stated that LPC offers the following products/services:
	
?	A US data base - archives date back to 1988.  This database has various fields describing default and nondefault loans, etc.
?	A public and private firm model (both) for an annual subscription rate of $75,000.  These models estimate PDs for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.
?	The firm is beginning to collect data in European countries.


	John will be sending us further details about the analytical techniques used to develop their public and private firm models.  In addition, he will send us information on the various fields used in their database.



Regards,
Iris

"Dilbert Newsletter 38.0","Dilbert Newsletter 38.0
-----------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   November 2001



Highlights
-------------------------------------------------
* Scott's Patriotic Duty
* Boss and Cow-orker Quotes
* Holiday Gift Ideas
* True Tales of Induhviduals
-------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

There are 400,000 people in the DNRC, each more attractive,
generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free
Dilbert Newsletter. Maybe that's a coincidence, but I'm starting to
doubt it.

My Patriotic Duty
-----------------

I've been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic
services in this time of global conflict. I don't think I'd be a
good candidate for Special Ops. I'd be the
one with the wheeled carry-on bag saying, ""Hey, guys, I have sand
in my shoe! Is anyone else hungry? Can I use my flashlight now?""

I'm already donating money to patriotic causes, and I bought some
plastic flags made in China, but I felt I needed to do more. Then
it hit me. There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my
entire life: dehumanizing the enemy. In a sense, that's been my
full-time job for years. I just need to replace the word
""management"" with ""Taliban."" So let's get started.

I've been trying to figure out the Taliban's long-term strategy and
I think I got it: They're trying to reverse evolution. Their
uncontrolled body hair is a good start. Living in caves was an
obvious step too.

The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the
children. But they've made great strides in that area. Have you
seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat
on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day? No math, no
social studies, just rocking and chanting. For PE they use sticks
to whack stuffed dummies labeled ""Bush"" and ""Blair."" I'm not sure
how they know how to spell ""Bush"" and ""Blair."" On any given morning
they're probably whacking dummies labeled ""Tqwft"" and ""Upxpgt"" but
it's a good aerobic workout either way.

Just for fun, ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum
could NOT be accomplished by, for example, a monkey: Rocking back
and forth? Chanting? Beating a dummy with a stick? Even if a monkey
only got a ""D"" in chanting, he would still graduate with honors
from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking
and whacking.

As I write this, our generals are trying to figure out how to get
the Taliban out of their caves. They're running sophisticated war
game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence. I
have one word for them:

                       bananas

I don't want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious
insults. As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil, I am willing to
promote them to full-fledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal
footing with everyone else who doesn't read the Dilbert Newsletter.

Now that we've dehumanized the Taliban, let's get on to the
important work of dehumanizing our bosses, cow-orkers and family
members.


Induhvidual Confusion
---------------------

Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others. For
example, they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving
wildlife, vision and their own pants. See for yourself in these
true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Cow-orkers, submitted by
DNRC members:

---

A VP was speaking at a meeting and said, ""Well, you can lead a
horse to water but you can't make him crap."" Someone up front said,
""That's drink...can't make him drink.""  To which the VP said,
""That's stupid.""

---

""In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed horse is king!""

---

A cow-orker once said, ""Looks like he's thrown a wrench in the
monkeyworks.""

---

""A two-prawn approach is necessary.""

---

Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the
other day. We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he
said I was ""preaching to the blind.""

---

""He won't last, he's just a flash in the pants.""

---

One of the employees called in to say that she couldn't come to
work because she ""...had to have an autopsy.""

---

My boss was telling a very involved story about something that
happened to him. He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a
philosophical summary: ""Sometimes fact is stranger than truth.""

---

""It's a catch 20-20.""

---

Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors.
An all-time howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to
ensure success for a campaign and his reply was ""Don't worry; I've
got an ace up my hole.""

---

At a management meeting, my CEO said, ""Our company is like a living
orgasm."" Now that's what I call job satisfaction.

---

I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having
achieved a goal. The Induhvidual replied, ""It was nothing. You
planted the seed, and I ran with it.""

---
In a meeting a cow-orker of mine referred to ""the carrot at the end
of the tunnel.""

---

""We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this
one.""

---

These all came from the same boss:

""Vision is in the eyes of the beholder.""

""Part of the verbiage is a language thing.""

""Eventually, I want it now.""

""It's not that kind of zero.""

""There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions.""

""In the last year, you've turned around 150%.""

---

When a high-powered agent of the company walked into the lunch
room, our secretary remarked to our group that she couldn't stand
him because he was ""so ego-testicle.""  One of my cow-orkers spit
coffee out of his nose, which just added to the moment.

---

""I think you might have hit the nail on the button.""

---

""...caught between a rock and a wet spot.""

---

And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said:

""I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought
of a name for you.""

Holiday Gift Ideas
------------------

When I'm not slaving away writing FREE Dilbert Newsletters for you,
I sometimes make holiday gift recommendations. I believe a gift
should acknowledge the recipient's unique personality and
interests. That's why I organized these suggestions by personality
defect.


For Heathens, Vulcans, Skeptics and Dogmatics:
----------------------------------------------

My first non-Dilbert book, ""God's Debris"" (now in hardcover), is
full of thought experiments about souls, free will and science that
will have your friends and family arguing with each other for
weeks. Combine the book with alcoholic beverages and there might
even be some slapping.

The book is designed to fit in a stocking and to look as if you put
more thought into the gift than you really did. Imagine how smart
you'll seem when you say, ""I found all the errors in reasoning. I'm
sure you will too.""

We probably didn't print enough copies of ""God's Debris"" for the
holiday season (really) - it's way more popular than I expected --
so if it's meant to be a gift, act now. Get several for your smart
friends or get just one and let people borrow it.

You can find ""God's Debris"" at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721909/unitedmedia/107-5126509-7932516


People With Short Attention Spans:
----------------------------------

I recommend the Dilbert Page-A-Day Calendar for people who can't
handle more than 10 seconds per day of any one type of
entertainment. For more severe cases of attention deficit, consider
the monthly wall calendar or the weekly planner.

Imagine the look on the face of the lucky recipient, full of
unmitigated joy and boundless appreciation for your gift-giving
brilliance.

You can find these calendars at the following links:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715712/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715690/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


People Who Are Hard To Shop For:
--------------------------------

I recommend my new book, ""When Did Ignorance Become a Point of
View?"" It's a compilation of Dilbert comics that won't clash with
anyone's home decorations or wardrobe. And it shows thoughtfulness
because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who
has.

Tip: When it's being unwrapped say, ""You'll like this unless you're
dead inside."" That prevents most people from complaining, which is
similar to being happy.

This book is available at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


For Dyslexics:
--------------

For dyslexics (like me) I recommend the or Calendar Day-A-Page
Dilbert, my book ""Debris God's,"" my and book, ""When Become Did a
Point of Ignorance View.""

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/


People Who Stand Too Close:
---------------------------

Dilbert mints, featuring Manage-Mints, Improve-Mints,
Accomplish-mints and Pay-mints are now available at:

http://www.candy2you.com/store/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=CS&Category_Code=D&Affiliate=Dilbert.

The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or
collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose.


Plop, The Hairless Elbonian
---------------------------

Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic
strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless
country of Elbonia. Unfortunately this isn't a good time to launch
a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban. So it's on the
shelf, probably permanently.

You can see the experimental strips at:

http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/

Let me know what you think.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Here now, more true tales of Induhviduals, as submitted by members
of the DNRC.

The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand
reminded me of another version I heard recently.  One of my
relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE.  It took
me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had
pointed out what a latrine is.  They had. She was apparently still
intent on using it.

---

When I received my new credit card, it had the number two (2) after
my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have, indicating
that my name is the same as my father's.  I called the bank's
customer service number and asked that their records be changed to
use the Roman numeral two (II) instead of the number two (2).

The customer service rep said, ""I'm sorry, sir.  My computer
doesn't have Roman numerals.""

---

I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil. During one performance,
where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under
their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing
complicated acrobatics at the same time, an Induhvidual behind me
said to her companion, ""That must take a lot of practice.""

---

At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeare's books
because, ""The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS!""

---

At the grocery store, the checkout woman scanned all of my items
then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar
code so she could scan it.  She asked, ""Do you know how much this
is?""

I said, ""I've changed my mind, I don't think I'll buy that today.""

She said, ""Okay."" I paid her and left.


Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

"Invitation to Present Feb. 21, 2002 Keynote Address at the  Spring 2002 University of Texas Energy Finance Conference","Mr. Whalley:

Greetings.

Further to my discussions with your colleague Vince Kaminski, I write you
at this time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance
Education and Research (CEFER) at the McCombs School of Business,
University of Texas at Austin.

Following the first University of Texas Energy Finance Conference in Feb.
2001, my colleagues and I are planning a second annual
practitioner-industry Conference in the Spring 2002, scheduled for 2/21 -
2/22/02, planning for which is on-going with your Enron colleagues.  The
Conference will kick off with a dinner and keynote address Thur. evening,
then continue all day Fri.

I write to extend an invitation for you to be the keynote speaker at the
Thur. evening dinner, or the Fri. lunch if your schedule precludes a Thur.
evening presentation.

Although the format for the 2002 conference may differ from that used in
Feb. 2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001
Conference Program.

You may recall meeting my UT Finance Dept. colleagues and I during our
day-long visit to Enron two years ago on Aug. 27, 1999.  I look forward to
seeing you again, this time on the UT campus.  With Best Regards,
Ehud Ronn

"Thank You","Vince,

I simply wanted to jot you this note because I find that I am sometimes able to address things better in writing than in a conversation.

I want to convey my thanks to you for putting up with me through this period.  I guess I was a bit shell shocked after seeing the project I had worked on, and the team I had built from scratch just going down in a matter of days, not to mention the changes on the personal side.  Through this period you offered me the type of support that perhaps no one else would have, and I want to say that I really appreciate it.

Over this period I got so entangled in my own problems and worries that I forgot that leadership is all about caring for others and not yourself.  My house is now in order, and I am back to my old self.  I want to offer you my full support at this time, and am at your service on whatever issue it is that you wish me to take up.  The company is facing trying times, and I would like to help in whatever way I can.

Please do put as much pressure on me as you would like.  I promise that I will push myself to the limit.  I am ready for the commitment to learn new skills, and have already been doing this, though it has been a slow process.  I will require yours and others guidance from time to time, but will be ready for anything you suggest.

Regards,
Sandeep.

PS:  
 I have written Paula a note (after our conversation yesterday), and will follow up with her.
I am going to send out a mail today to celebrate my daughter's first birthday, and would like you to keep the 11th of November free!

"Structural Risk and Lack of Liquidity Grow in Influence in Regional Gas Markets - CERA Private Report","
Title: Hidden Risks: Microbasis in the Short-term Gas Markets
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2826;


***********************************************************************

STRUCTURAL RISK AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY GROW IN INFLUENCE IN REGIONAL GAS
MARKETS.

The dramatic increase of participants in the daily market for natural gas over
the past several years has brought with it the demand for pricing indices that
are increasingly regional and selective in nature. These published indices
provide a valuable service to the market, but the high level of confidence that
the general trading community has bestowed upon them may be misplaced.

*  Current economic conditions are masking hidden volatility potential,
especially at local index points that have unrealized demand potential.

*  Large, volatile demand in the form of new gas-fired generation utilizes the
existing pipeline system in ways that were never envisioned in the original
system design.

*  Control of pipeline infrastructure has moved from the relatively benign
local distribution companies to economically driven traders and asset managers.

*  As demand grows, physical flexibility in the system and the number of buyers
and sellers decrease on the margin.

"systemic risk","Dear Vince,

I tried to call but your phone was busy. I'm an unofficial advisor to the
White House energy team and they've asked me if Enron's bankruptcy presents
a potential systemic risk. I told them I did not think so.

This is FYI only... as I am unencumbered by the facts, it was only a
judgment call on my part.

Feel free to call me at 781 245 2036.

Best of luck... we're thinking of you and wish for the very best.

Today's focus: Extra secure

By Dave Kearns

Novell has announced some new biometric-related partners for
its Novell Modular Authentication Service, or NMAS. SAFLINK,
AuthenTec, Iridian Technologies, Biometricate and Precise
Biometrics have recently released technology to integrate their
products with NMAS.

NMAS allows you to specify different methods of authentication,
either singly or in any combination, with the possibility of
basing authorizations on the authentication method used. The
traditional Username/Password combination is supported, as well
as smart cards (or tokens), proximity cards, digital
certificates or biometrics.

The new partnerships announced are all in the biometric area,
covering iris-scans and fingerprints, adding to the already
large number of biometric-security vendors supporting NMAS.
Vendors and their products include:

* AuthenTec - AuthenTec's FingerLoc and Entr?Pad fingerprint
  authentication products read fingerprints below the surface
  layer of the skin, resulting in more accurate acquisition and
  recognition rates.

* Biometricate - Biometricate's fingerprint authentication
  software will generate a complete audit trail of every
  authentication transaction. Whether the authentication attempt
  is a success or failure, a record is created incorporating
  details such as server and client IP addresses, date and time,
  and the user's logon credentials, including the finger that was
  used for the authentication.

* Iridian - Iris recognition from Iridian Technologies is based
  on the rich detail of the iris of the eye and scales to support
  millions of users.

* Precise Biometrics - Precise Biometrics' Precise 100 product
  family for fingerprint recognition has been on the market since
  1999.

All of these new partners function with NMAS via SAFLINK's
SAFmodule, which integrates a variety of biometric technologies
into the NMAS authentication infrastructure, including
fingerprint, voice, facial and iris recognition. SAFmodule also
provides specialized features such as support for user self-
enrollment, a biometric tutorial module and a disconnected
login capability for mobile users.

The partners join previously announced NMAS security
partnerships that include ActivCard, Applied Biometrics, Arcot
Systems, BioID, Biometric Access Corporation, Cherry
Corporation, Compaq, Entrust Technologies, Identix
Incorporated, RSA Security, SAFLINK, SecuGen, SmartTrust,
Systemneeds, VASCO, Veridicom and VisionSphere.

Authentication and authorization have gone way past simple
password control. Find out more about protecting your network
at http://www.novell.com/nmas/

You may be very glad you did.

"Job Market","Dear Colleague:

    I would like to call your attention to three fine Penn students on
the job market this year, Sean Campbell, Clara Vega, and Canlin Li.
Their interests and skills span time series econometrics, financial
economics and macroeconomics.  I have attached my letters of
recommendation, which provide much more detail.

    I hope that you will seriously consider interviewing them if their
skill match your needs; please simply contact them directly if you want
to do so and/or if you would like more materials from them (their
contact information follows at the end of this email).  In addition,
please don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance in
any way.

    Finally, I hope that you will excuse the intrusion caused by this
communication, but email is the least intrusive and most efficient way
that I know to get the message out.

                                                            With best
regards,

"Energy Committee Minutes from January 23rd","Energy Committee Members

The following members were in attendance at the January 23rd meeting: Bruce
Williamson, Tina Sivinski, Tim Tipton, Bruce Sukaly, Bob Peebler, Vince
Kaminski, Dean Arthur Warga, Praveen Kumar, and Lane Sloan.  The handout
material is attached for members that could not attend.

The committee viewed a TV ad  for the Bauer College and a TV news story on
the new AIM center and  Cougar Fund.  The first item of business was the
Partnership program.  The committee agreed on the following levels:

             Trustee            $100,000
             Partner                50,000
             Investor               25,000
             Sponsor              10, 000

For this year,  these levels would receive placements in the new Energy
Certificate Programs which will start in September of this year as follows:
Trustee up to 10, Partner up to 4, Investor up to 2, and Sponsor 0.   All
members of the partnership program would be able to participate in the
Learning Community programs of seminars, forums, and symposiums free of
charge with the number of attendees and special arrangements varying
depending upon the partnership level.  The Chairman noted that with the
certificate classes beginning in September, then the annual fee structure
would need to align accordingly which left a funding gap for the first part
of the year for the marketing costs to launch GEMI.  The original idea had
been for the one time entrance fee in the Partnership Program to cover these
costs but as you recall the committee did not favor that approach.  The
Chairman asked the committee to provide ideas on how to fund these marketing
efforts originally targeted at $200,000 for this year.

Dr. Kumar discussed three energy certificate programs to be available as 1)
Risk Management 2) International Project Finance, and 3) Energy Accounting.
The courses can be fully developed for the Risk Management and Energy
Accounting to start programs in September (many already available).  The
International Project Finance may require additional time because of
development efforts on certain courses.  Dr. Kumar requested that the members
identify people in their organizations that could give detailed feedback on
the course proposals so we are assured they fit the needs of the Energy
community.  We will also begin discussions with Energy committee members on
what level of participation your forsee for your company.  Dr. Kumar noted
that the BS and MS programs would be underway but less of an issue for course
development as students would not be taking these more energy focused courses
until junior and senior years.  He said that specialized training programs
seemed to be of high interest and more activity than originally anticipated.

The chairman covered the feedback on the seminars, forums and conferences.
There was real interest in seminars and forums but committee members did not
recommend pursuing conferences at this time.  The plan would be to have in
steady state 3 seminars per year which would be for large audiences with a
featured speaker.  It was noted that the venue would be an important
consideration to attract appropriate audiences.  Various suggestions were
given on topics of interest with an overall view that the presentations
should be practical and of high quality. The committee agreed that a
reasonable fee should be charged to non members of the partnership program.
The feedback on the forums was that they should be smaller more focused
groups with different formats depending upon the subject matter.  The thought
was that they could address overarching issues integrating energy and service
sector considerations. Non members would not participate but selected student
participation was seen as valuable.

A new concept of symposiums was introduced based on discussion with various
committee members.  The idea of a symposium was to bring together important
spokespeople and other key participants on a topic of high interest to the
Energy community. The Bauer College would provide a coordinating role to
address the issue with the objective of gaining input on all fronts.  Dr.
Kumar noted that there had been various discussion with members around
current topics emanating from the Enron collapse such as clearing house and
credit risk considerations.  The committee was quite enthused that an
imporant event could be created but it needed to be very carefully thought
out as to topic and the management of the process including the media.  It
was discussed that if the Bauer College wanted to sponsor such an event then
it would need to provide a project manager.  Committee member companies would
need to provide assistance/advice particularly on coordinating the media.
Dr. Kumar will be sending out an e-mail to get your input.  Then Dean Warga
would make a decision on whether to pursue such a significant event which
could be a great launch vehicle for GEMI but also carried a series of risks.

Next, Dr. Kumar discussed briefly the trading center noting that the key
issue was endowment funding before any significant activity could take place.
 The college was continuing to think through the content and integration with
other aspects of GEMI, the AIMs investment center, etc.

The Chairman then discussed GEMI's overall marketing image.  There was some
fine tuning of the proposal providing further clarity and emphasis of key
aspects of GEMI but in general a high consensus on the desired image
contained in the attachment.  After the dialogue on the symposium, which
would be a major marketing effort in an of itself, the discussion on external
and internal promotion was tabled til next meeting.  The chairman noted that
there would probably be a need for a two tier approach if the symposium
effort was pursued.  The major focus initially being on the symposium then
coupled with a growing effort on the overall GEMI marketing
over the next several months.

The last item was the competitive assessment/relationship with other
universites and organizations where the chairman discussed the current
approach and principles in the attachment.  This received good support from
the committee.

The committee members recommended the next meeting to occur in six weeks.  I
will send out a separate e-mail on possible dates for you to consider.

Best Regards,
Lane

"Historical Correlation Calculator","I finished a spreadsheet for calculating historical correlations on forward curves. It gives the correlation matrix for contracts going out an arbritary number of months out. I think it might be a handy tool for some of you.

You may get that on O:\RESEARCH\CUSTOM\CORRELMATRIX\

It demands that you have access to our EGSPROD32 database. You must have that configured in your ODBC. It is a large spreadsheet, so it may take some computing resorces. Let me know if you find any problem.

Thanks.

"Power and Gas Trading","

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

  I agree with you that it's a lesson people need to learn
over and over again.  I can't tell you how many politicians
I met over the past year who really don't like markets and
certainly don't understand how or why they work.  These
aren't just the minor leaguers in Sacramento, but the big
league players in Washington.

  I also agree that the academic community can play ""an important
role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of
deregulation process.""  I'd like to think that is in large
part what I have been trying to do.

"opportunities in Enron","Hi, Vince,

This is Slav Fain - Oracle DBA  and I hope you
remember me. We've met at the infosession in Berkley
and have talked about Houston, rotation program or
other possible openings Enron might have.

Today I've saw an add for the Junior DBA position in
Houston and I was wondering  if it might be in your
company. I beleive I told you, that I'm pretty open
for different position. I was doing a lot of
development projects in Berkley and enjoyed it. I've
also found DBA work also very challenging and
rewarding. I would be very intersted in joining the
rotation program to see different possibilities and
aspects of IT department.

I'm opening for relocation and I think with knowledge,
experience and my enthusiasm to learn and ability to
work under tight timeline - I think I can be a good
match for Enron.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Slav

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

"New CERA Study - ""New Realities/New Risks: North American Power & Gas 2020""","Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski
Managing Director
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Powerful new forces are transforming the North American gas and power
industry, bringing considerable volatility and uncertainty to investment
and strategy. Questions relating to prices, security, geopolitics, the
global economy, and environmental concerns are forcing reconsideration
of basic assumptions and plans.

To address these questions and concerns, Cambridge Energy Research
Associates (CERA) announces a timely new multiclient study, ""New
Realities, New Risks: North American Power and Gas 2020.""

In an online interview CERA Senior Director Lawrence J. Makovich
presents a brief overview of major issues to be addressed in the study.
To hear more information about the study, please access the interview on
our website at http://www.cera.com/mc?c=2804&p=1044 .

Using CERA's scenario planning methodology, ""New Realities, New Risks""
will present plausible alternate paths to the future of power and gas
markets in North America over the next 20 years. The Study will provide
useful tools for evaluating corporate strategies and investments as well
as an integrated assessment of gas and power market analyses.

The study will address key issues including
*What levels of gas and power prices are sustainable?
*How will the current wave of power plant and gas pipeline
infrastructure development shift North American energy dynamics?
*What opportunities, risks and challenges face those involved in the
industry?
*How will technological developments affect future gas and power
markets?
*Will the role of government expand or contract in the energy industry?
*What will be the cost and value of increased energy security?
*Who will be the winners and losers in each scenario?

For complete details of the study, including deliverables and proposed
study content, please visit our website at
http://www.cera.com/offerings/details/1,1504,CID2299,00.html.

In the traditional CERA format, the study will start with a kick-off

"two potential projects at MIT","Hi Vince, 
How are you?  Everything is going well here in Boston.  I am staying very busy in school with the core business classes.  I am taking an intro to Finance with Myers which is very good, but otherwise my classes are very fundamental.  I'm finding the most challenging part of business school is juggling all the extracurricular activities.  
Today we kicked off our first official team project which is very similar to the Tiger projects at Wharton that we worked on last spring.  We have a lot of flexibility with the topic of the project.  We are just supposed to find a real company or business unit that will let us analyze a recent, ongoing, or anticipated change initiative.  All that is required is that the initiative be important to the company, represent a change, and have organizational implications.  I don't know if you or a business unit of Enron you know of would like some free consulting in this area, but if so I would love a chance to talk with you about it.    
Another group of us are starting an Energy and Environmental Finance Club this year.  We've collected over $3,000 for the club from about 100 MBA and Manufacturing students, and we will get more from the school.  We would like to bring in speakers from the industry to tell us about new initiatives and the state of the business.  Would you or someone you know be interested in presenting to the club?  The students would really appreciate your involvement. 
Please feel free to forward this email to whomever you think may be interested in these projects.  I will try calling later this week to touch base and see how everything is in Houston.  See hello to Shirley and everyone else for me.

Frank,
portfolio POWER-NW-LT includes subportfolios EPMI-LT-NW-PR1 and EPMI-LT-NW-EX1.
The last one has VAR about 29M but when I look at the component VAR for POWER-NW-LT
there is no VAR corresponding to EPMI-LT-NW-EX1.

This is probably irrelevant to the question we need to resolve: why backtesting for POWER-NW-LT
does not look that good. Did you check that the prices behavior corresponds to high vols traders post?

"[JGSADJ] Faculty Reporting System","Dear Faculty,

On Jan. 31, the new web-based faculty reporting system -- developed to
provide a mechanism for faculty members to file electronic annual reports to
the Dean while also updating their Jones School web pages -- will be
launched. This system will allow you and/or your staff assistants to 1) file
annual report to the Dean; 2) maintain individual faculty web pages; 3)
output entries into downloadable Rich Text Format, so that entries into the
system can be used to update CV's.

Although the system is designed for ease of use, you are invited to join
staff at the training session from 2:15 to 3:45 p.m., on Thursday, Jan. 31
in Rm. 101. Staff assistants will be trained to use the system in order to
provide you with assistance if you need it. The session will provide a
walkthrough about how to use the system, make, change, and save entries for
the annual report to the Dean.

Attached is a detailed user's manual in MS Word and Acrobat PDF for your
records. On Jan. 31, we will send you another e-mail with the site admin web
address and instructions to log in so that you may begin using the system.

Many thanks,

Vince- 
I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!). 
I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my 
""father"" here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I 
know the kind of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire 
the high standards you set for all of us in your extended ""Group."" 
I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter 
to their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters. 
We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you. 
It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits. 
I ""took one for the team,"" Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less. 
I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

"help finding finance work","Dear Vince,

Just to remind you, I will be graduating this May with an MBA from Rice.  My
concentration is in finance, but I'm also an undergraduate engineer from
Cornell University and an IT specialist.

I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I
can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search.  I've been
somewhat frustrated trying to explain why I'm more effective than my peers.
Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three
months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year.  This was
probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into
program code quickly and reliably.

I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and
show quick success.  What I can't say in my resume is that I'm the best in
my class at finance, statistics, and information technology.  However, this
combination is also my biggest crutch.  I'd like to engage all my skills,
but typically, interviewers are only looking for one.

Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in
my skill set?  I'm indifferent to moving anywhere in the U.S.

Vince, in any case, I appreciate your time and any suggestions you could
offer.  I had a wonderful time working for you, we really had a good team.
If you have any questions for me, please call or email me at any time.

Sincerely,
Chris Pernoud

P.S. If your son ever wants to startup a linux company, I'd be interested in
helping, he could email me at cgp1@cornell.edu.

"RE: longitude","Chonawee,

	Good work. I'd like to add a few observations. Regarding your comment about not being able to buy straddles:  Longitude informed us that an upcoming implementation (that is actually in place now but has not been made available so as not to complicate the initial auctions). The new implementation allows packages of digital spreads to be bought and sold as one instrument, resulting in terraced payout functions that approximate true call and put (and presumably collar and straddle) payouts. Even so, the structures will remain largely digital in nature; therefore, they will be rather dirty hedges for traditional calls and puts regardless of how one packages them

	As far as getting a bad price, the auctions here are indeed Dutch auctions, but I believe that the limit orders address this issue -- they assure a given payout ratio. Certainly there is no guarantee that any of the amount laid down by a participant will be placed, which is another problem for hedgers. (Then again, a traditional hedger who asks too much for his offsetting transaction is also unlikely to meet with success.)

	Lastly, with regard to the last paragraph on publishing tentative prices, it is left up to to the discretion of market maker to decide how much of the auction's internal operations (including tentative prices) is posted, but remember that the auction is intended to last only a few hours at a time, yet again constraining the auction's suitability for hedging (admittedly, there would likely be several auctions throughout the life-cycle of the underlying index).

Attached please find a paper I wrote earlier (before we discuss with them this afternoon) about the longitude. 
(Vince, I already gave you a hardcopy of it earlier.. in case you wants a softcopy)

As Vasant pointed out, it looks like they already did the real-time tentative prices posting in their system. So now hedgers can participate in the auctions. I still feel that the system will attract speculators more.

Thanks!

Importance: High



Dear Tiger Team Hosts 2002:
Thank you for your interest and commitment to participate in Wharton's Field
Application Project.  With your help, we continue to expand the diversity of
our host representatives. We especially thank those returning hosts, whose
feedback was responsible for several program design changes which we believe
will improve the program. Our goal is to continue to build our partnerships
and to together create changes that benefit all. Feel free to call upon me
to discuss any aspect of the program or special needs. 
As a next step in the process, I am asking that you submit, by email, your
project proposals no later then September 14, 2001
<mailto:FAP@management.wharton.upenn.edu>  These proposals do not have to be
detailed, we just need to know what you are considering. We ask for
proposals at this early date because some hosts have expressed the desire to
get faculty involved early in the process. We think that is a good idea so
faculty will begin to review the proposals in September. This will allow
faculty to get involved earlier in the process and the final project scope
will be more of a host/faculty collaboration. 
As a reminder, projects should be cross-functional in nature with 3, if not
4 of the business function areas; finance, accounting, operations,
marketing, management and strategy. Because of the more integrative nature
of Tiger Teams,  projects should have strategic implications. Faculty will
happily assist hosts in developing these project aspects. 
To ensure that the projects yield significant benefits for all participants,
we ask hosts to appoint at least one on-site contact person to help define
the project objectives, interact with the faculty and student team
representatives. 
Our tentative FAP calendar can be reviewed at the website:
http://fap.wharton.upenn.edu/TigerHost/tiger_host_overview.htm  If there are
only particular dates for which the host representatives are available to
come to campus for the Kick-Off, Mid-Project Review and Final Presentations,
please schedule them as soon as possible, as they will be done on a
first-come, first serve basis.
Feel free to contact us should you have any questions. We look forward to
working with you. Again, thank you for your support of the Wharton School.

"","Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

"","Vince,

You had asked if there was an English language description of the regulatory changes that have taken place since rationing.  I seem to recall reading something in a wall-street analysis, but I can't find anything in my files.  I asked one of our analysts to take a look, but so far he's come up empty.  I'll keep trying.

It was really good to have you down here; everybody was happy to have your attention for a couple of days, and I think that we identified some promissing areas of collaboration.  I look forward to staying in touch.

I am attaching the most recent versions of the ""business plan"" relating to
the Energy Markets Institute (EMI)---this includes a detailed concept paper
with curriculum of the degree and specialized programs, a note on resource
requirements, the marketing plan, and the execution time-table. The EMI has
recently been established at the Bauer College, and we would like as soon as
possible to get together with crucial people in the industry and get
feedback and suggestions.  Our aim is to make this into a world class energy
education and research center as expeditiously as we can.  Your input and

	   Dear Mr. Kaminski:

	   Hope your day is going well. Philip Merrill suggested I contact
you
	   regarding a conference I'm organizing on Implementing the
Commodities
	   Futures Modernization Act. The conference will include sections
on
	   Single
	   Stock Futures, Clearing and Trading Facilities. The latter
section will
	   include a session on the new electronic exchanges and I would
like to
	   invite
	   Enron to speak on their electronic energy trading exchange.

	   The conference will take place September 20 - 21, 2001 at The
Drake
	   Hotel in
	   Chicago. The session will be in the afternoon on Thursday,
September 20.
	   I
	   expect the conference will draw 100 executives from broker
dealers,
	   futures
	   commissions merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool
	   operators,
	   introducing brokers, investment banks, exchanges, and clearing
firms.

	   The Institute for International Research (IIR) is the world's
largest
	   international conference company with 120 different business
units and
	   4,000
	   employees in 36 countries. Founded in 1973 by Irvine Laidlaw, the
	   current
	   Chairman, IIR continues to provide unbiased, bleeding-edge
business
	   information through our conferences, workshops, seminars, and the
	   Internet.
	   For more information on IIR, please visit our website at
	   http://www.iirusa.com.

	   A draft agenda is attached for your review. Please note it is a
work in
	   progress and I will be finalizing it over the next week. I
welcome any
	   feedback on how to improve the program, as well as any speaker
	   suggestions.

	   Thanks again for your assistance. I'll follow-up with you next
week, but
	   please feel free to contact me in the interim with any questions.

	   Enjoy your weekend.

"COM course from Durasoft","Durasoft (the company that did the Java class) will be holding a course on COM object programming for Enron Networks.  COM allows for programs to be written such that they are available for execution to other programs on a language independent basis.  Several Research members are interested in this technology.

The class is $15,000 for 15 people and NetWorks has a few spaces that are unfilled.  We can send a few people, therefore, for about $1000 each.  The course is May 14-18 (which conflicts with the EPRM 2001 Conference), so they need a total soon.

Is this course something group members can sign up for?

Thanks,
Martin

Tom,

The Lukens' storage model is very similar to yours. I got a paper from the lead developer
Dr. Hugh Li, explaining in significant details about their model.

Let us compare notes after you read it.  We have both DP approach (mine) and optimization
approach (yours). We may combine the advatanges of the two approach into one product, and
then we can claim we have the best Storage Model (and sell it if Vince feels like it). 
Sounds like a plan ?

"European Gas Watch Consumption and Supply Database - CERA Report","
Title: European Gas Watch Consumption and Supply Database
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2387



The Fundamentals--Demand Influenced by Power Prices?

The outturn of demand for gas in OECD Europe in 2000 was 484.6 Bcm (billion
cubic meters), 2.0 percent above the previous year's level of 441.1 Bcm. This
was a strong performance, supported by continued switching to gas in power
generation in Italy and Spain. But despite the relatively strong performance,
several countries recorded a decline--Germany and Netherlands in particular. Gas demand appears to have declined in countries where power prices are low.
Companies shut-in production of electricity by cogeneration and bought from the
grid, decreasing overall gas demand. Electricity trade increased between
Germany and the Netherlands, with low electricity prices in Germany lowering
overall electricity production from gas in the Netherlands. The total quarter-
on-quarter growth in the third and fourth quarters was due entirely to the
underlying increase in demand for gas for power generation.

Residential--First quarter demand was strong with colder weather over the same
period in 1999. Temperatures were high in the fourth quarter, dampening
residential demand. The continued increase in connections to the grid in most
of Europe maintained residential, commercial, and small industrial consumption
despite some warm weather patches throughout the winter.

Industrial--Industrial demand was strong throughout the year, particularly in
countries with strong economic growth during 2000--France, Spain, and Belgium.

Power generation--Dry weather in the first quarter of 2000 led to an increased
use of gas in power generation switching from hydropower. However, in some
countries--Italy, for example--wet weather increased hydro output, decreasing gas demand in the fourth quarter. Overall fourth quarter demand in the power
generation sector was sustained by incremental new, gasfired capacity that had
come onstream.

"MSCF Advisory Board Membership","Vince,

I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating
in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in
quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is
deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward
to your visit.

On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on
our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership
(http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation
from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in
expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!

The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York.
Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enron's participation
on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program
to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a ""first
look"" at the ""MSCF Resume Book.""  From our standpoint, your experience and
counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and
opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.

Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan.
Would you be willing join us?

"new bldg- book space- library?","Vince-

Are you going over to the new building right away?

The reason I ask is on the trading floor the workspaces are very small,
and there is no room whatsoever for books (eg, econometrics texts).

I think this revives the issue of a library. We used to have a wonderful
one, then it went away.

I was wondering if you could keep a thought in the back of your mind in
terms of a place where people could go to find and read good textbooks.

Thank you,

"resume of Torpong Cheevaprawatdomrong","Vince and Stinson, 
I talked with Torpong, the friend of mine that I mentioned this morning. His original plan is to take MBA classes in the fall and go back to work for his father's company. But he has a very good impression of Enron's image and if he can gain work experiences at Enron, it would be the best. He is interested to work for Enron, at least for 1-2 years, before going back to work for his father's company. I am sure that he is a smart person and can learn things really fast. Attached are his resume and transcript. I think we should telephone interview him.
Thank you,
-Chonawee

"Strategic Challenges Grow in Environmental Arena - CERA Watch","
Title: Viewing Environmental Strategy Issues in a New Light
URL(s):

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2758;


***********************************************************************

STRATEGIC CHALLENGES GROW IN ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA

The issues that are most prominent in the environmental arena are notable for
their relatively long time horizons. Thus, although the uncertainty created by
recent events might cause adjustments in environmental strategies it is less
likely to result in fundamental shifts in direction. In the immediate future,
however, the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while
maintaining long-term objectives.

* Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations,
while the US focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear.

* The European Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme, while individual European nations are developing or
implementing their own (potentially incompatible) systems.

* Continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security
concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche, bringing
increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles.

"Seminars","
Vince,


Two recruiting seminars this week for the Finance Department that may be of
interest to you.

(1)Thursday, November 29:  Evgenia Portniaguina (University of Utah). She is
completing here Ph.D., and is one of their strongest students ever. She is
originally from Russia with a BS in Exploration Geophysics (4.0 GPA), Oil &
Gas Academy, Russia.  She will now speak on a Finanicial Market
MicroStructure topic, but she could be of great interest from the Energy
Institute point of view.  Her seminar is in Room 256, Melcher Hall,
10:30 -12 noon.

(2) Friday, November 30:  Peter Carr, Adjunct Professor at Courant
Institute, NYU...His specialization is in derivatives (although he will talk
on ""Hedging with Incomplete Markets""). His talk is also in Room 256, 1:30-3
p.m.

I attended a derivatives seminar put on by the Lacima Group.  It appears to me that this group has modeling expertise that could accelerate our progress towards properly modeling correlation and forward volatility dependent options.  I have spoken with Bob Lee on this issue.  I am already trading a relatively large (1000+ contracts) crack spread options book and a modest time spread options book.  I am planning to expand our activity in these markets through Enron Online.  Also, I would like to start trying to develop markets in contingent premium options on heating oil and jet fuel.  To do this, I need research help in implementing a consistent approach to modeling forward forward volatility, especially with regard to heating oil (seasonality).  I would like to discuss this in greater detail to scope the next step forward.  Thanks, Mario.

"RE: Summary of meeting","Vince,

I took the curve shift P&L from the RMS database and prompt month volatility for both GAS and POWER for the period of Aug-2000 to Aug-2001.
In case POWER, volatility has relationship with VAR but less likely with P&L.  For GAS volatility, the correlation with VAR is weaker than the case of POWER and also low relationship with P&L.

   
Thanks.

Cross correlation matrix for each commodity with every other commodity
Correlation of power and gas volatility to Enron's trading earnings
Comparable analysis of Enron ROVAR to other trading organizations (e.g. banks, hedge funds, etc..)
Analysis of amount of economic capital versus cash in order to support a certain VAR

"Energy Institute Curriculum","Dear Vince,

	We have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational
programs to be offered by the Energy Markets Institute that Arthur Warga and
I discussed with you in the summer.  I am attaching (tentative) curricula
for two important programs: (1) A graduate certificate in Energy Finance,
(2) A 5-year BBA/MS program in Energy Finance.
	Briefly, the certificate is a 5-course for-credit program that is
available to people with sufficient basic background in finance, economics,
statistics and mathematics.  This certificate includes coursework in
accounting issues specific to the energy industry, basic aspects of energy
sources and the organization and regulation of energy industry, forecasting
and time-series econometric methodologies, basics of financial engineering
and derivatives, real-options and project analysis as it applies to the
energy industry, and energy derivatives and risk-managament.
	The 5-year program is more ambitious. It seeks to provide a broad
but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and
managers. In the undergraduate component students take rigorous courses in
math, probability and statistics, economics, chemistry and physics, and
accounting and finance. This is conceived to be an ""elite"" and highly
demanding program where students have to handle the more demanding courses
in a variety of areas.  The 5th or graduate year of the program is given
over to the energy certificate and additional graduate courses in finance
and accounting.
	I know you are extremely busy, but it would be very helpful to get
your reaction (even at a broad level) to these programs and the type of
courses that are envisaged.  We view these programs to potentially form the
core of the educational activities of the Institute, but the next step would
be to develop more specialized programs (of shorter duration) aimed at
professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry. We
are in the process of setting up the Institute and developing its governance
and administrative structure. I will give you more details very shortly.
	On another topic, Darrell Duffie (with whom I interacted with a lot
during our student days at Stanford) will be coming to present a seminar at
the Bauer College on January 10. We very much hope to see you and the Enron
group there.
	Finally, I hope that you and all of your loved ones and colleagues
are as well as possible in light of the recent tragedies. We can only hope,
pray and work to see that these senseless acts never again occur anywhere.


Best wishes,

Praveen

"Housing Data and Stationarity","Eugenio,

As a follow-up to our meeting yesterday, a series of evaluations was conducted on the housing starts data to insure that the time series response variable was stationary (recall our brief discussion of results based on non-stationary time series).  Dickey-Fuller and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (accounting for autocorrelation in the error term) unit root tests were used in the evaluation process.  Given the limited number of observations for  certain potentially important explanatory variables (e.g., %population change, etc.), we tested the housing starts variable over 3 historical periods.  The results are provided below:

Period 1:  1959 through 2001 (obs=503)

TEST		TEST STATISTIC		CRITICAL VALUE (p=0.05)
    
DF			-6.712				-1.95
ADF (5 lags)		-2.436				-1.95
ADF (1 lag)		-4.689				-1.95

Period 2: 1984 through 2001 (obs=201)

TEST		TEST STATISTIC		CRITICAL VALUE (p=0.05)

DF			-3.140				-1.95
ADF (5 lags)		-1.158				-1.95
ADF (1 lag)		-2.053				-1.95

Period 3: 1996 through 2001 (obs=62)

TEST		TEST STATISTIC		CRITICAL VALUE (p=0.05)
DF			-6.354				-1.95
ADF (5 lags)		-2.100				-1.95
ADF (1 lag)		-3.954				-1.95

**Time series stationary if TEST STATISTIC < CRITICAL VALUE

Based on the results above, the housing starts time series are stationary, with the possible exception of 1984 through 2001 data.  Since you are likely to use the entire data series in an AR framework, the assumption of stationarity holds.  Let us know if you have any further questions.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

"Risk New Update - 26/10/2001","Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 26/10/2001

JP Morgan Chase was in the news this week. First, its US credit derivatives group said it was considering partnerships with affiliated companies and data vendors to redistribute its data and create an industry pricing benchmark. Second, it and Deutsche Bank separately signed deals with US technology solutions provider Longitude to speed the introduction of broader index trading based on economic data.

The idea to create credit derivatives indexes is not new to the bank. Its European operation has already set up a credit default swap data service - albeit that it has received a somewhat underwhelming response from clients, bankers said. But global credit derivatives head Andy Brindle said the US approach would be different to Europe, although he declined to provide more specific details due to the early state of negotiations.

Wider-than-market indexes are also a relatively uncharted territory, but the use of Longitude's Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA) technology, could be the first step towards banks reducing market risk. PDCA products should
be self-clearing and self-hedging, and priced according to customer particpation. They are therefore not dependent on supply and demand constraints. JP Morgan Chase plans to use the technology to create products based on economic statistics published by the US government and US
government agencies. Deutsche plans to use Longitude to create derivatives based on economic statistics published by European and Japanese governments.

Meanwhile, Moody's Risk Management Services has formed a strategic working group - the RiskCalc Sponsor Group - with nine major banks, to develop European credit risk benchmarks, using its RiskCalc software. The RiskCalc

RiskNews Update - week ending 8/6/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
============================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 8/6/2001

Morgan Stanley swept the board at RiskNews' sister publication Credit magazine's second annual European analysts' survey this week, claiming 12 first place awards out of 17 categories for credit research excellence. The firm improved on its performance last year, when it was in the top five in eight of 14 categories. Morgan Stanley credit strategist Neil McLeish typified his firm's performance having risen from fourth place last year to claim the top spot in the strategy sector this time around. Merrill Lynch also performed well, with 13 mentions as a top-five firm in the 17 categories, including first places for high-yield telecoms & media, high-yield industrials, and index provider categories. Another outright winner was Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which topped the high-grade consumer products sector. A full version of the Credit magazine awards is available at www.creditmag.com.

More responses to the proposed Basel capital Accords - Basel II - emerged this week. The Institute of International Finance, the US-based association whose membership includes Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS, said it was concerned that the proposals may result in an excessively conservative and costly capital framework that overestimates the amount of risk on banks' balance sheets. Separately, investment managers said Basel's move to cover operational risk is flawed.

In Asia, meanwhile, Credit Lyonnais issued what it claims are the first call warrants on a basket of Chinese 'B shares', following the decision by China's securities regulator to allow local Chinese to buy these shares, which previously were only available to international investors.

Finally, RiskNews will report extensive coverage of events at Risk magazine's Risk 2001 USA conference in Boston next week. Look for top stories in the conference update box on www.riksnews.net

Vince/Vasant:

This relates to my early coversation with Ed today. He requested our help in puting together a text for the Accenture project, which is about recreating the Derivatives I, II, II classes in an electronic/interactive environment. As he pointed out, it would be nice to have the first assignment for early next week. I agree with Vasant in terms of being almost impossible to get something ready by tomorrow.
Vasant also sugested that we use the Technical Corner Articles as a source for this. Maybe Sam may help on that. Whatever we do, however, we would like to have you review the final text. 

I will get back to Ed on that today. Please advise.

Thanks for helping out with this need.  Here is the information that I need your help with:

Assignment #1
Two-Three paragraphs of content for each of the following areas:
1) Price Risk
2) Basis Risk

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Price Risk
   Definition of price risk
   Volatility
   High-level discussion of how a trader/structurer will hedge against
   daily price movements
   Two or three examples showing how price movements affect a trader's
   position

Basis Risk
   Definition of a basis risk
   High-level discussion of how a trader/structurer will hedge against
   basis risk (i.e. what are the components of a deal that a
   trader/structurer must identify in order to effectively hedge basis
   risk)
   Two examples highlighting basis risk within a deal
____________________________________________________________________________________________
Assignment #2
Natural Gas Markets
   First few paragraphs on:
     What is Natural Gas a mixture of?
     Unit of Measures (Btu vs. cf, MMBtu vs. Mcf)
     Regulatory environment - how is it regulated?
   Three-four paragraphs on the following:

   A couple of paragraphs on:
     Deregulation - timeline
     Level of liquidity in the market

It would be great if I could get Assignment #1 sometime tomorrow, however, early next week is OK.  Assignment #2 is not as time sensitive and I would like to know if you think that it is even something you could respond to.  Please advise.

As we discussed, original is preferred, but certainly not necessary.  If you want to use other resources, please do so and footnote just your sources.  Also, if you need to postpone the options training class on 10/19 to respond to this request, please feel free to do so.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Thanks,

"Comments of Wolak","Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @ENERGY v2.2. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email. Please see below for more information
regarding this new release.

Please confirm that your address above is correct by clicking reply and
send. If any changes need to be made, please make the changes above and
reply.

Here is an overview of the new features from the release notes:

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) No change.

@ENERGY (Advanced) No change.

@ENERGY (Swing) No change.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

@ENERGY (Storage) Module  @ENERGY (Storage) is the new module for analyzing
storage contracts.  The two new functions specifically designed for
valuation and management of storage contracts are:
7	STORAGEOPT and  MCSTORAGEOPT

To get familiar with these new functions, we recommend that you first read
the brief description of the type of storage contracts supported in the
Instruments section. A description of the methodology used for valuation is
provided in Storage Methodology.  The template storage.xls will help you
understand in details input requirements, as well as the output generated by
these functions.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been
implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and
Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT,
OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all
models.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Your input into the refinement of this product is welcome and greatly
appreciated. Any comments or suggestions may be sent to support@fea.com .

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. We appreciate this
opportunity to be of continuing service to Enron North America Corp..

The following (very long!) URL will place you at the top of the live-link tree from which the Research Area is clearly visible. 

http://livelinkeu.corp.enron.com/LiveLink/LiveLink.exe?func=ll&objtype=141&objaction=browse

Alternatively one can access livelink from a link on the bottom left-hand corner of the Enron Europe Intra-net homepage.

Regards
Jag

I am generally of the opinion that the lists should be as short as possible.  A directory that Lance and I share with the power group was deleted yesterday but nobody knows who did that.  I hope after this audit is done, we are much less at risk of something that like happening again.

"RE: Factor Loadings Process","Ramesh,

 I believe the inception document for automating VaR processes you prepared in April already covers the requirements David has listed with minimal changes. Please review and comment as needed.

Subject:	Factor Loadings Process

As an FYI for those not already in the loop, new factors for VaR have not been implemented since some time in April, and it seems the process of administering them is foggy.

So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings: 


 << File: FactorLoadingProcess.doc >> 

Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:

Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations;
Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;

For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).

Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.

Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

"Risk 2001 Australia","Dear Vince

I am currently producing Risk 2001 Australia (Risk and EPRM magazines'
annual Australian derivatives and risk management congress) which is taking
place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. I understand that you spoke at our
Australian Energy Risk 2000 conference last year.

I have now put together the draft programme and I am at the stage of
inviting people to speak at the event in August. I would like to invite you
to speak at this year's congress and I attach a copy of the draft programme.
I particularly had in mind the presentation 'Case study: learning the
lessons of the Californian electricity crisis - could it happen here?' (talk
number 7 in stream three of the programme which focuses on pricing, trading
and risk management in the Australian energy markets). However, if there is
another topic that you would be more interested in presenting then please
let me know.

This year's event combines last year's Australian Energy Risk 2000 and Risk
2000 conferences to create Australia's most comprehensive risk management
and derivatives congress. This year the congress will also include two
one-day post conference seminars on 22 August. Should you require any
further information about the programme or the event generally, please don't
hesitate to contact me either by telephone on +44 20 7484 9866 or by email
at pannesley@riskwaters.com.

I very much hope that you will be able to accept this invitation and I look
forward to hearing from you.

"FW: INFORMS Presentation","About the INFORMS presentation, there were many people showing their interests, including Prof. Suvrajeet Sen from Arizona, Prof. Jussi Keppo from Michigan, and couple of students from U. of Pittsburgh, CMU, and U of Maryland.
Prof. Sen invited me to meet his group there, Prof. Keppo wants to join effort in writing a paper, and a CMU student offer to join work for his Ph.D. requirement. (See their e-mails below).

Those opportunities sound interesting. I think it will be good for the company too because we will have additional people working on the problems that will benefit us. If you have any research problems that you want me to work on please let me know then.

On the other hand, I will not give away our secret. I will consult with you first if I am not sure how secret it is.

"the special pattern recognition problems","Hi Vince

Here's a rough draft for your perusal and comments.  I can be reached at
(517) 423 5617.


We at ICAST have had a meeting to explore the two problems we discussed with
you and Vasant over the phone last week, and we have decided we feel
confident we can find optimum solutions to these problems given the
necessary support.

Outlined below is the approach we have used for solving difficult pattern
recognition problems in the past for Eli Lilly and GM.  If Enron is
interested in this approach, we would be happy to submit a proposal to Enron
to take on this project for one or both of the problems you described.

Task 1.  Our company will analyze the data sets available from Enron for one
week at our own expense.  The purpose of this analysis is to estimate the
cost (amount of time and the skill set needed) to develop proof-of-concept
prototype software.

Task 2.  ICAST will then demonstrate the POC software to the Enron
scientists at the Enron facilities using the training set(s) and one or more
new data sets.

Task 3.  Given successful demonstrations of the POC solution(s), ICAST and
Enron will meet to discuss the efficacy of the approaches used and will
determine jointly the specifications of planned production software, and the
method of providing this capability to Enron for routine every day use.

Task 4.  ICAST will submit proposals for developing the production versions
of the softare that will meet the agreed upon specifications.


The cost of developing the proof-of-concept software, and the labor needed
to demonstrate it to Enron is estimated to be $150K (plus out-of-pocket
expenses) for each of the problems, and, it is estimated at this time that
the calendar time needed for each of the projects is about 4-months.  It may
be possible to do the two Proof-of-concepts concurrently.

I will call you before the end of the week to discuss this recommended
approach.

CEO ICAST

It was a great pleasure to meet you in London.  After our lunch I had interesting discussions with the research group and continental trading group.  How was the response on your lecture/speech?
 
You mentioned that you could send me an interesting book on derivatives.  I am really looking forward to dive into it.  If you have two copies we may have one for reference and one for in-depth study at home.
 
You also mentioned that Tom Halliburton or Pereira could give a hands-on course in SDDP.  As I said, I am very interested in such a course some time this year.

"RE: Pricing of restriction on Enron stock","Vince,
I just spoke with Rakesh.  I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about.  There are actually two different sets of forwards: one for up to 18MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall, and the other was for 12MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares.  We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March, and I'm certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the 18MM shares.  In fact, I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology.  Of course, the valuations on the 12MM shares had no such component.  Let me know if you have more questions or concerns.  Thanks Vince.
Ron

Ron,

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the Enron's point of view.


Please, let us know if this is required.

"Estimation of Bankruptcy Probabilities Using Bayesian Approach","Estimation of Bankruptcy Probabilities Using Bayesian Approach

Yongdai Kim and Gunhee Lee
Department of Statistics, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Yongin, Korea
College of Business Administration, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea

Abstract
Bankruptcy probabilities of private companies are estimated via Bayesian approach. The proportional hazard models are used with time to bankruptcy as a dependent variable. Several financial ratios are included as independent variables. MCMC algorithm is used to obtain the posterior distribution. Finally, bankruptcy probabilities of companies are predicted using the predictive probabilities. 
Keywords: Proportional Hazard Model, Bayesian analysis, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, bankruptcy prediction model.

     The Bachelier Finance Society was founded in 1996 by a group of
  researchers in Mathematical Finance to serve as a platform where
  academics and practitioners can meet and exchange ideas spanning across
  Mathematics, Finance, Economics, Econometrics and Insurance. To achieve
  this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.
     The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary
  talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an
  overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will
  also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,
  Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems
  in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will
  complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.
      The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for
  discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the
  fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future
  development of Mathematical Finance.

"MRHV Model (power curve)","Dear Vince J Kaminski,

As a Mathematical Trading and Finance MSc student (City
University London) I am writing my dissertation on ""power
forward curves"".

Since you have participated in the writing of the
book ""Managing Energy Price"" I was wondering if you could
eventually help me.
The MRHV model seams to be the best econometric one to
model the electricity forward curve.

I understand and know how to work out with the classic Mean
Reverting Process, but I don't understand the MRHV (I don't
know the discretised form and I cannot even find any paper,
or article on it) and how to get rid of the exponent to
estimate my parameters (long-run mean, Speed of mean
reversion, volatility, exponent, Floor price).

Thank you by advance for any help

Yours sincerely
Sylvain Joret

I regret to inform that I am terminating my job with Enron today 12/06/2001. Despite the later events I had a great time working with everyone in this company. More particularly, I will miss a lot of the excitement and learning opportunities that The Research propitiated in this last 3 years.

I will be pursuing new opportunities in a different company and as soon as I settle I will inform my new contact info. I will still be residing here in Houston I and I am looking forward to continuing nurturing the friendship we developed throughout these years.

Many thanks.

"HJM simulation","Please find attached the code for the HJM simulation model for option pricing and other necessities.
The model takes as inputs prices and volatilities and generates a daily spot price grid and respective transition probabilities - a framework for pricing options of multiple kinds.
As it is, the model seems quite flexible and detailed. It takes care of fwd-fwd volatilities and uses different factor loadings for each month - this means that the model takes different PCAs as as the curve shrinks in time. Also, the user may define as many factors as the size of # of points in the fwd curve.
One interesting aspect is the way I evolved the spot price to provide convergence to the prompt month price as the month approaches its end. Before shocking prices (spot and fwds) I get the expected spot for the next day by linear interpolation with the prompt fwd. By ensuring convergence, however, the model creates a spot price vol that converges to the prompt month vol. The phenomena is illustrated in the spreadsheet example where I call the model for each day of the first month to calculate the respective daily expected prices and vols.
As usual, I put the whole project on o:\research\common\project\options\HJM. It is self-contained - no need for other files and the whole source code is there. To see the the spreadsheet you need to install the fwd-fwd vol function and the loading factor function. You will find these things on o:\research\custom. Note that this is not necessary to run the model itself. It just makes the spreadsheet more illustrative and the code more understandable.
Regarding the last, I tried as much as possible to make the code clear and lean hoping that you feel confortable with its pieces and usability.


         
These are the files:
	HJMsim.c - Main file
	HJM.c - Where the simulation is actully run
	Support.c - set of support functions for the simulation (fwd-fwd, PCA, etc...)
	NRC.c - set of NRC functions I used (changed variables from float to double)
	NRUTIL.c - modified to accomodate memory management of double tensors
 
Please let me know your opinion and the bugs.
Thanks.

US oil futures prices dropped below
$18/bbl Thursday for the first time
in 2 years as traders continued
to worry about lower demand and increased
inventories. The market will

said analysts.

"your upcoming visit","Dear Vince,

In view of all the turmoil at your company these days, I thought that it
might be a good idea to check in with you and confirm that you are still
planning to come to campus on 11/15-11/16.  We have you scheduled to
present to students on 11/15 from 11-2, and on 11/16 to present a seminar
to the finance faculty.  We also have a room reserved for you at the Judge
Baylor house in Waco for the evening of 11/15.

Besides confirming your visit, I am wondering whether you would recommend
that I have my students read any articles in preparation for your
talk.  Would it be okay for me to assign your paper with John Martin
(forthcoming in the JACF) entitled ""Transforming Enron Corporation - the
Value of Active Management""?  Also, would there be a seminar paper that I
could distribute for the faculty seminar, or would you prefer to have more
of a free flowing presentation along the lines of what you did for me
during spring 2000 at LSU?

Finally, if you want me to distribute any other materials to the students
or faculty, please let me know.  We are looking forward to your visit!

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Hi:
 
I would like to submit an article on a fast Risk Evaluation and Profiling methodology to the Risk Desk. Fast REP is a powerful graphical method to compare risk management policies. It focuses on extreme potential losses and potential pain points. While having some similar characteristics with the VAR (Value at Risk) framework and the Nobel-prize winning Markowitz model of variance minimization for a prescribed mean rate of return, it shifts the focus from an investment orientation to a risk management perspective extremely appropriate for a variety of industries, such as energy or telecom.
 
This methodology has been created by Stanford University Prof Sam Chiu and myself, and is now being applied as consulting services by Oncept. Attached is a copy of an unpublished article on the subject. We will adapt it or modify it to fit your editorial constraints, should you be interested. Please see below for a partial list of other articles published by the same  authors.

"Hi Vince from Australia","Hi Vince,

Well I am speaking at Risk 2001 (which is the combination of Risk 2000 and
the Australian Energy Risk 2000)on the 20th, 21st and 22nd of August in
Sydney Australia. I was hoping to see you again but you are not speaking
this year.

Well I left iEnergy as a Risk Analyst (www.ienergyglobal.com) to Intelligent
Energy Systems as a Market Analyst (www.iesys.com) ~ who have a licence in
Enron Sydney for Prophet (Price Forecaster). After my probabation they
offered me a good salary and permanent position (this was an awesome job)
but I was offered an Associate Lecture in the School of Banking, Finance and
Accounting at Griffith University in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Maybe
I am following your starting career in Academia.

I had an interview with Enron Sydney with Raymond Yeow (but did not make the
grade) ~ pricing interruptible options. Well my other friend Quentin Kerr
who sent over his papers with (Professor Burrage and Professor Gray from the
University of Queensland) to you had an interview with your Houston office
(but he did not make the grade) also.By the way how were the papers?

Still I am determined to write more papers in this huge market and maybe I
will catch up with you on the American or European Conference Circuit.

Kind Regards

"RE: Check","Shirley,
Thanks for the update.  While I am disappointed about the delay, I appreciate you and Vince staying on top of it for me and keeping me informed of what is happening.  I guess I will just have to wait my turn with the others going before the court and hope that I will eventually be paid.
I hope you and Vince have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year despite all that is going on around you at Enron.

Just an update.  I understand the check was entered into the system, but then has to go before the bankruptcy court for approval.
I think you will eventually get it, but there is no time frame.  They are paying the invoices to keep the company running first.  
 
I know you wanted this for Christmas and I really apologize for this, but I think you will get it sooner than later, hopefully.
 
Have a very Merry Christmas and I will keep you updated as I learn things.

Using this code we can calculate jump-diffusion parameters based on historical data for

Hi Winston,

I put the jump source code under the vobs/vatr/src/vatrjumps. You can access with project name prj_vatr_jumps.
I also talked to Jin about it so IT can modify and put it to production. 

Thanks.

"Re: (no subject)","
No problem, Vince. I will certainly put you on the  programme on the following subject:
Measuring energy risk

Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research,  Enron N.A.
Are your details correct? Also, would you like to  expand on the topic title? Maybe include something about VaR, regulatory  requirements and/or price volatility?
 
Regarding the workshop: Mark's  e-mail is MTWilliams@edisonmission.com , his  telephone is 617-912-6000. Since I am due to go to press this week (inevitably,  it always comes down to a mad rush!), would it be possible for yourself and Mark  to devise a programme for the brochure? Or, please send me, and Mark, your  half of the programme and I will get his half of the agenda. If at all possible,  maybe you (or we) could have a telephone conversation and decide on an agenda  for the brochure.
 
I very much look forward to your response in due  course and to working with you once again.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

Andreas, 
I take  advantage of the weekend to catch up with my mail. A few points: 
1. I  would be glad to speak at the energy risk stream. I can cover either 
point  1, or 8 or 6 (in this order of preference ). 
2. Regard Mark Williams,  I would be glad to work with him on ""Setting up a 
credit risk function for  energy companies."" I can send both to you and him a 
reprint of a paper on  this topic that I co-authored (to identify some issues 
of interest to me)  and I am sure that we can split the territory between the 
two us. Please,  send me your and Mark's mailing addresses. 
The second topic (RAROC) is  more fuzzy and we may need to hold a 3-way 
conference call on this  subject. Everybody defines RAROC differently. 
Please, feel free to  forward my message to Mark.

"RE: Please advice on the estimate of mean reversion rate for electricity price","
Dear  Visit
 
The  results you have obtained are usually caused by regressing the lagged return  instead of the leading return. That is you must regress the return of the period  following the log price against which you regressing:
 
dx =  x(t+dt) - x(t) against x(t)
 
Hope  this helps.
 
Regards
 
Les.

Subject: Please advice on the estimate of  mean reversion rate for electricity price
Dear All,
My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi. I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the  advice on his article ""The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity  Derivatives"" and he had mailed me the copy.
I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric  Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper  ""Making the most of mean reversion"" to estimate the mean reversion speed. I  use Queensland half-hourly price during 13 December, 1998-30 June 2001 giving  about 44,000 price observations. 
However, the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to  different sign for both slope & intercept. The coefficient and standard  error are as followed:
Intercept: -0.3931 (0.0076)
Slope: 0.1171 (0.0022)
R Square: 0.0585
Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated  slope has the positive sign. I have also tried monthly data and the results  are the same. It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this  matter.
Kindest regards,
Visit

Ramesh,

 I believe the inception document for automating VaR processes you prepared in April already covers the requirements David has listed with minimal changes. Please review and comment as needed.

Subject:	Factor Loadings Process

As an FYI for those not already in the loop, new factors for VaR have not been implemented since some time in April, and it seems the process of administering them is foggy.

So here is an outline of the R&R and required technology to support the administration of factor loadings: 


 << File: FactorLoadingProcess.doc >> 

Broadly, I have assumed that Global Risk Ops can run the process. However, exceptions can take one of two forms:

Large jumps in VaR due to bona fide changes in correlations;
Pathologies in the matrix construct supporting factors;

For either, tools are required for users to examine the exceptions and make changes as necessary (generally Global ops in the former case and RAC/Research in the latter).

Note that the IT Development group has no part in this business process beyond building the tools.

Lets use this as the starting point to develop a business model that makes this work.

"Options approach for EOL price setting","
Vince,

Over the weekend, I fomulated the idea using option pricing for the EOL 
price seeting rules. The initial results look interesting.  I will write it up for
your inputs.

Also attach is the program SnagIt, for printing window.

-------------------- main idea ------------------------------

A market maker fulfills the obligation to provide liquidity,
therefore he should be compensated for his service. In the option
langauge, the market maker sells options to the traders, for a
market order to buy, the market maker has to sell at the ask price
and for a market order to sell, the market maker has to buy at the
bid price. When the ask price is hit the trader exercised a call
option against the market maker, when the bid price is lifted, the
trader exercised a put. The option premium that the traders paid
to the market maker is implicitly embedded in the bid-ask spread.

There is a capital requirement for the market making. In a rising
(falling) market, the market maker will accumulate a net short
(long) position. There are two kind of costs. The first is
associated to carry the market-to-market(MTM) value to the next
period. The market maker needs to charge a risk-free interest for
the carrying the inventory to the next period. The second is the
charge for the risk capital. If the ask (bid) were hit (lifted) in
a rising (falling) market, the market maker would realized a loss
reflecting the MTM change. Thus, the risk capital that the market
maker laid aside is the amount of money that he is prepared to
lose, in exchange for some return. The risk adjusted return on
capital or RAROC rate reflects the risk attitude of the market
maker in providing the liquid to the market participants.

In balance, the market maker sells options to compensate his costs
in provide market liquidity. From this train of thoughts, I derive
a formula for the bid and ask prices as function of the last
executed price, inventory level, price volatility, trade size,
order arrival rate, risk-free interest rate and RAROC rate. The
limit orders are not considered here, since there are very few
limit orders traded on EnronOnLine (EOL).

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Vince,

I met with Niki last week in which we had a general interview on his interests.  He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.  Somewhat of a unique combination.  He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments.  In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group.

I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.  Pls let me know if you are able to make contact and see a possibility for him at Enron.

thanks.

Joe

Thank you very much for sparing your time with me, yesterday, and explaining
Enron's dynamic and aggressive business.  It was very impressive and
intriguing.

I have revised my resume and have added information regarding the actual
systems and projects which I have worked on both for Salomon Brothers and
Toshiba.  I have attached a list of publication also.

Please feel free to let me know if you need further information.

I will await for a feedback from you, regarding where I might fit in within
the Enron organization.

assignments and I would certainly like to return the favor.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"Denise Palmer Huggins Interview","Seminars/Forums, etc. Sub Group

I met with Denise on December 16th and here is a recap of the discussion
relative to our sub group for your information.

Seminars

-Probably no more than 4 per year
-Good curriculum makes a significant difference (ie. quality)
-Keep at a reasonable cost
-Nymex provides seminars which have an audience of 35 to 50
-Denise's experience is that people like topics that are practical adding to
their skill
  base

Forums

- Broader topics than seminars with range of experts
- Can range in size from small groups to very large ballroom settings
- Marketing makes a big difference in turn out

Conferences

- Generally not as excited about conferences
- Shouldn't try one this year
- If do one, keep focused on one topic, not multiple tracks
- Should be lean and mean, cost effective, 2 days max

Nymex has many contacts and should be able to help on marketing events and
perhaps  doing some sponsorship.  Probably should charge for non members for
these events but needs to be reasonable.  Small training sessions could be an
opportunity.

Denise, hope this is a reasonable summary; please add anything I have left
out.

Title: LNG in the Mediterranean: The Search for Additional Markets
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2960;


***********************************************************************

THE REVIVAL OF LNG IN THE MEDITERRANEAN

Recent developments confirm the revival of LNG in the Mediterranean. Will this
pace of activity be maintained? A brief assessment of key markets suggests that
there is a risk they will be oversupplied in the medium and longer-term. LNG
producers may need to look to alternative markets for the next generation of
supply contracts.

*  A rash of LNG contracts is fast filling up the Iberian market.

*  Pipeline supplies have cornered the bulk of the Turkish market.

*  LNG developers may now target the Italian market, although the obstacles for
LNG in Italy remain significant.

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

Maureen,

Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (August Board meeting) one more time before I forward it to you.  He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation (CPI,PPI, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.  Typically, we receive both FX and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.  I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.

For now, this is the list of countries for which  we will  probably need the FX and/or inflation curves.  I will send the specifics per Andre later today.

India 
Philippines
Bolivia
Jamaica
Guatemala
Venezuela
Columbia
Puerto Rico	CPI only (I need historical inflation data, as well)
Panama
Brazil		we have current data already
China		we have current data already
Euro		inflation only

I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting/IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already.

Thanks!

Cindy

Subject: Prospective hire
Dear Vince
I know that you are always looking for good  prospective hires so I am bringing this to your attention. Armando Ugarte who is  a former Ph.D. student of mine is currently working for i2 in Texas but told me  recently that he is considering a career move. Armando has a very interesting  background combining excellent training in economics and operations research  with extensive practical experience in IT working as software architect and  application developer for HP, Oracle and i2. I know Armando for over 14 years  since his undergraduate studies in our department and was always fascinated by  his broad spectrum of talents and experience. I am enclosing his resume. I do  not exactly know what his immediate plans are and if he has already another job  lined up. He told me ,however , that he would like to make better use of his  education. He took the job at i2 after deciding, for personal reasons, to  repatriate from Colombia where he held a faculty position. I highly recommend  him as a hard worker, solid and mature researcher and a very likable person. If  you are interested you should contact him directly. His contact info is on his  resume.
Regards, Shmuel.

Today's focus: IBM's latest Linux servers keep chugging

By Phil Hochmuth

Enterprise Linux users looking for the latest and fastest
server hardware might want to check out the new eServer xSeries
servers from IBM.

IBM's new servers will support Linux on up to 16 processors in
a 3U (three rack unit) sized box. The first versions of the
xSeries will include 32-bit Intel processors, with 64-bit chips
to come later.

An interesting feature that could be useful to server
administrators is the ability to partition processors on the
xSeries servers. With this, users could set up a Linux server
to do multiple tasks in a single box, such as assigning
different bunches of processors to handle Web, database, e-
mail, or file and print serving. Different Linux distributions
could be run on the partitioned processor groups, or even other
operating systems, such as Windows-based systems.

The new IBM servers support several hardware enhancements aimed
at making Linux systems more reliable. The xSeries will include
what IBM calls Active PCI-X, which allows a server technician
to replace PCI or PCI-X adapters or peripherals on the fly,
without having to power down the server. A ""memory mirroring""
feature is also included, which can help avoid crashes due to
corrupted memory. Mirroring allows a server to detect when a
RAM module goes bad and replicate the system memory from hard
disk space, allowing for the bad RAM to be replaced without
shutting down the server.

Next issue, we'll look at how Dell is keeping pace with its own
Linux server offerings.

Subject: Reference request regarding Eric W Cope S05371/R966
X-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""US-ASCII""


Dear Colleague:

Eric W Cope has submitted an application to AT&T Labs,
with a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application.
We thank you in advance for providing this letter.  The reference letters are
a very important part of our evaluation process, but we also recognize that
they call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part.
In this message, we first describe below the three options for submittal
of the letter, and then, in the final paragraphs, you will find some
comments about the nature of the job applied for.

We know your time is precious, so we have tried to make the
process as efficient as possible.  If you have access to a browser
from your mailer, then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below:

  http://www.research.att.com/~kbl/cgi-bin/resumedocs/S05371/R966

Via this web page, you can submit text, html, postscript, or pdf files.
Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for
this particular student.  It is linked directly to the student's resume,
and the processing occurs automatically and immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying
to this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending
the letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and
not as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes
the entire subject line in your reply message.
If you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter
will occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.

Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless
you ask that it be treated as fixed-format.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please
note that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be
distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you
wish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html
for information on the proper address to use for various purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:

This student has applied for a summer internship.
We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate
work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,
depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in
a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the
ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function
somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization
with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you
may have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new
material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.


Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Ken Lyons,
AT&T Labs Web Resume Database

Thanks for the notice, Shirley.

I already posted your resume at Reliant Resources, but Reliant Energy I
couldn't find secretary position. It's excellent if Vince can help. I
hope you can work here at the same building.

Next week any time is fine with me. But don't make it hard. If it's not
convenient for him, it's OK. I can see him sometime around. If
available, what about Tuesday 11:30? (feb. 5th.) I just want to talk
with him before he leaves downtown.

Good luck for the job search!

Hi Shirley,

I found that I have an already set up appointment on Tuesday(29th of
Jan). Would you move the appointment with Vince on Wed., Thu. or Friday?

In the process of referring you a senior secretary position in here, it
required your cover letter and resume. But without them, it processed.
(I briefly mentioned your job at Enron and left your email company
address.)
If you don't receive any contact from here, please let me know. Also I
saw 2 other postings of executive secretary position.   

See you tomorrow.

Jaesoo

1) Did you talk to Whalley about Christian Werner?  I am sure that the is going to be calling in the next few days, and will want to know the status of his employment with Enron.
 
2) As you know Stephen Bennett would like to go to Rice's Executive MBA program.  In light of everything that is going on, do you still want to fund this?  The cost is 65K for two years, and we will need to submit a letter of nomination on Enron letterhead signed by a senior exec agreeing to do the following: 1) provide full financial support for the nominee, payable at the beginning of each academic year, and 2) Schedule the Nominee's work and travel requirements to permit regular class attendance, including the international trip, and completion of class assignments.   Steve would like to attend in the fall, and app's are due in the beginning of 2002, so we just need to work on this, if you agree to pay for it.

"Various","Dear Dr Kaminski:

Best Wishes for the New Year to you and your family!

Some time ago I sent you a letter with information on the Bachelier
Finance Congress. I never received a feedback from you and I am concerned
that perhaps it never reached you.

In any case, please let me know if you need any help with your travel
plans to Crete for you and/or your family.
( You may visit the web page of the Congress
(www.ma.utexas.edu/Bachelier2002) for information on location, plenary
speakers etc.)

On a different note, I would like to ask you if you would be
willing to come down to Austin and give us a seminar. Our workshop meets
on Fridays.

I sincerely hope to hear from you soon and to meet you in Austin.

Best regards,

Thaleia Zariphopoulou

"Re: Interest in Quantative Finance","Hello Vince,

I would like to reiterate my interest in meeting with you to gain a better idea of the type of work conducted within your group at Enron.  This would provide me with an opportunity to see if the activities within your group fit with my expectations.  Additionally, I could expound on my interest and work concerning numerical methods for pricing and hedging derivative securities.  A formal interview could be established at a later date.  For your reference, I've attached a copy of my resume.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

We've now got some slick results on rigorous and replicable avg temp
forecasting models for twelve major U.S. cities, with implications for
weather derivative demand and supply (although they are not yet written
up formally).  Will you be in Phila anytime soon?  I would like to sit
down with you for a couple of hours to show you the results and
discuss.  Are you still interested in pursuing a joint project?  I am
excited about this.

All the best,

Frank

"leadership conference at MIT","Hi Vince,

I saw that you will be featured on the finance panel for the leadership
conference at Sloan.  I plan on attending, and will enjoy seeing you
again.  I don't know if your schedule is too full but it would be great to
catch up if you have any time.

The first semester here in school roars on.  We had our first midterm today
(accounting).  For me, it feels like school will be over very quickly.  Not
surprisingly for Charlotte and the boys, it probably can't be over soon
enough.

I hope things are well with you and everyone else in Research.  Give my
regards to everyone.

"FW: Strip of Spread Options","
Paulo,

Our Calgary office needs an option model that prices a strip of daily spread options.

In Exotica, we have the Ostrip model that does a strip of daily European options.
To modify that into spread option, we need to replace the EURO() function into 
Spdopt()  function. 

Lon would like to speak to you directly tomorrow about his specification. 
I think one week or so is probably a reasonable time line for the delivery.  Thanks. 


Zimin

Zimin,

As we were discussing, it would be extremely helpful to our desk if the research group could create a new exotica function that would calculate a strip of daily spread options similar to how the ostrip function calculates a strip of daily options.  We have just put on a sizable daily spread option position and expect to add to it in the following months.  A new spread option function would be invaluable for marking to market our existing positions as well as help us to price new deals quickly.  We currently value each option in the strip individually.

Thanks,
Lon

"Thank you.","Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you so very much for your time on Wednesday. It has been
challenging to find out, from the outside, exactly what your group does
on a daily basis and what type of people make up your team. I do not
feel that there is any substitute for the information, and feel, that
one can get directly from the source itself, thank you for making your
team available to meet with me as well.

You mentioned that the Associate Program at Enron could be a great
starting point for me to acquire the business skills and experience that
I seek. I would be a most enthusiastic candidate as I have looked into
the program, and I too, feel that it would be an exciting and logical
starting point for me.

It is my understanding that in order for me to enter the program I would
require sponsorship. Would you be able to sponsor me for this program?
If so, I have attached my cv (as a Word '97 document) and understand
that the person to be contacted with a nomination would be Mr Jeff Davis
in Human Resources. Please let me know if there is anything further that
I can do to realize my goal of working within Enron while gaining
business skills and experience.
It was a pleasure speaking with you.

Thank you again for your help and encouragement.

Sincerely,
Dr. Marilyn Mielke

"Re: calculating bid-ask prices","Rich, Thanks for your response. Sorry for the long e-mail. I did not expect to be this long but it kept getting longer and longer while I wrote it. We can set up a meeting to discuss about it instead of reading this long e-mail.

You know, any individual product has two risk components---unique risk and market risk. Most products in energy industry have very high market risk and very low unique risk. (For example, a price of gas produced from Texas is highly correlated with the Henry Hub spot price.) Since the market risk plays an important role in the energy commodities' prices, people buy and sell commodities or their derivatives mainly for ""hedging"" purpose---to reduce their market risk. 

However, the movie market is quite different than other commodity markets. The Gross Box Office receipt of ""The Little Mermaid"" has low correlation with the sum of Gross Box Office receipts of all movies releasing at the same period. An individual movie has very high unique risk and very low market risk. If you remember, the consultant last Friday said that if we own about 15 movies, their combined total revenue would be pretty much accurately forecasted. That means movies' market risk is low and ""hedging"" is not important comparing to ""diversification"".

Since the unique risk plays an important role in the movie market, I would expect that most of our customers would buy and sell for ""diversification"" purpose, not for ""hedging"" purpose. The producer of some movies would sells part of their movies and buy part of the other movies to diversify their unique risk. 

I think we are going into the right direction by creating this movie market so people who long on a small set of movies can sell part of them and buy some parts of other movies. The buyers and sellers in this market can all just be the people who naturally long on some slates of movies. They will sell some of their own and buy some of others.

I think the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity is good but we need to make sure that diversification can still be done through this market.

If Enron wants to take some position, I would recommend that we must be diversified enough (15+ movies as the consultant said). We should avoid taking a position on a small number of movies. Otherwise, we will be just an ""inefficient"" gambler. (Like putting all the money into only one or two stocks. We could have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by investing in S&P500.)

For your questions about the bid-ask pricing system that I proposed in the previous e-mail, if there are no buyers, the tentative bid-ask prices would be very low. So we tell the seller to reduce their selling price to this level if they still want to sell to us. (We can set our bid price to be low enough by subtracting its unique risk premium---insurance premium--so now we can take this position and behave like an insurance company. But we need to have (or expected to have) a significant numbers of similar deals of other movies.)

I agree that leaving open orders for several days might be a problem. We can set the ""bidding period"" to be just only 1 day (e.g. every Monday) and everything is cleared at the end of the day. 

I have not seen other markets using this dynamic bid-ask pricing system and the idea was just came up by myself, so I believe it is new. I plan to write a memo explaining the details of this system and send it to you.

Dear everyone, please correct me if I am wrong.
Thanks,
-Chonawee

Subject:	Re: calculating bid-ask prices   

Chonawee:  

Thanks for your input.  This is similar to what I was thinking.  Our prices would be ""indicative"" only.  We could take positions, but initially would try to find the other side of any deal we'd do.  That's why we've been spending a lot of brain cells trying to come up with an exhaustive list of the ""natural"" buyers and sellers.  To the extent we make the product more generic (e.g., a slate of movies as opposed to an individual picture) we may drive out more liquidity. 

I'm a little unclear on the settlement.  What if there are no buyers - do we tell the sellers they didn't get done?  Also, a buyer or seller would have to give us an open order (which might be okay).  However, leaving an order open for several days might be a problem.  Are you aware of any other markets which trade in the way you suggest?

Rich

I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily.

One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post ""tentative"" bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price. These ""tentative"" bid-ask prices get updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price. Next week, we repeat the same process.

This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we don't take any position at all. We make profit from those bid-ask spread. We don't have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders' trading because we don't have to take any position. Let the market be the one who decides the price. 

If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

Thanks,
-Chonawee

Subject:	some more input

Hi Rich and Key,
Again I think your idea is very good. I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the ""mark-to-market"" charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money.
In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.)
We can offer other derivative products such as options as well.
-Chonawee

MEXICO'S NATURAL GAS PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY: LOWER THAN EXPECTED?

A series of important developments in Mexico's gas market is reducing the
potential for long-term domestic natural gas productive capacity.

*  Low natural gas exploration and production investment. Investment in natural
gas exploration does not appear to be enough to significantly increase
productive capacity in the future.

*  Low expectations of the new Pemex multiservice contracts. Though Pemex has
announced a new model for service contracts and expects to have a bid round by
mid-2002, CERA does not expect an enthusiastic response from the private sector.

*  New liquefied natural gas (LNG) import projects reduce the pressure for
increasing domestic capacity. The strong interest in developing LNG import
terminals and recent LNG regulatory progress are reducing political pressure to
increase domestic capacity.

Steve Shreve
Professor of Mathematical Sciences

The three new members of the board, Ashvin Chhabra,
Art Mbanefo and David Waldman, were asked to present their
perspective on future human resource needs of the industry.

David reported that Putnam relies on both fundamental
and quantitative analysis.  In fixed income markets,
he noted the shift from treasuries to mortgages and corporate
bonds, and pointed out the accompanying rise in
the importance of credit risk analysis.  Although Putnam
has been a major employer of MSCF students, he noted that
increased emphasis in our program on the asset management
industry would be welcomed.  He pointed out the need
for our students to understand how to translate theory
into practice and to communicate to audiences of
various backgrounds.  For David, applicants should be able
to pass the ""airport test:""  if you are stuck with this guy
for half a day in the airport, will it be a reasonably
interesting experience.

Art also emphasized the key role of communication skills.
He wants people who are very focussed and who can find
practical solutions.  He welcomes applicants who have prior
accomplishments which show they can be trained and have
discipline.  He cited music and athletics as areas in which
these traits can be demonstrated.

Ashvin proposed that students should prepare for the ""elevator
test:"" if you happen to ride the elevator with a managing
director, between the sixth floor and the lobby can you
explain something to him in a way that he appreciates.  Ashvin
believes that MSCF students, and quants in general, must
either be able to work on the trading desk or have management
skills if they are to survive in the long term.  He expects
there to be growth in demand for people who understand
technology and business.  He thinks personal finance
services will also be an area of growth.

Echoing one of Ashvin's points, Joe would be interested in
people with the skills to manage IT projects.

Two subjects raised by Rick are whether the MSCF program should
specialize, say into energy or asset management, and whether
there should be additional courses in subjects such as
accounting and corporate finance.  The consensus was that
the MSCF program should stay general, within the quantitative
finance niche, and should remain highly quantitative rather than
tipping toward an MBA.

There was discussion of the desirability of internships.  Joe
pointed out that 80% of the Morgan Stanley hiring is from
internships.  An internship doesn't have to be for a summer;
eight weeks is possible.  Steve observed that we have not in
the past had difficulty placing students even though our program
does not include an internship and that an internship would
lengthen the program beyond 12 months.  Joe said that a
longer MSCF program with internships would permit different
student cohorts to overlap so new students could learn from those

"RE: PDS - more media","Katrin,

	Thanks for all your hard work. I think the more coverage the better, so I would definitely like to put together something for GEB. (We do have some other paper by one of the structurers in the group on the same topic that we could use as a fallback.)

Joe,

Your paper on power demand swaps is in high demand with the trade press:  The Journal of Derivatives: Use, Trading and Regulations will run it in their August edition; Derivatives Week published it Monday 28; Derivatives Strategy and Risk Management both consider publishing it.  

In addition, Global Energy Business and Electric Light & Power are interested in running the paper, but only one will at the end feature it because both target the same audience.  However, your friend Ann Ku currently is working on a story on weather derivatives in general for Global Energy Business and she proposed to feature Enron's power demand swaps as part of the article if you would be willing (and your schedule permits) to create another example including quotes and graph (different from the one used in the paper) on how this tool works, for instance, for a golf club, manufacturer, etc.  This way, we would receive coverage in Global Energy Business and could pitch the story to Electric Light & Power.

Please let me know your thoughts regarding this matter.  Thanks!

"P/L Breakout","This analysis was another swag at p&l components. We took the numbers from the daily position reports, backed out the big originations that we new about (e.g. peakers sales) and the other ""mistakes"" (e.g. the EES $700MM loss), then took out the curve-shift P&L from the backtest data, the balance we said must be some form of ""new deal"" P&L plus realised p&l etc.
It shows that 2000 was the prop trading year, whereas 2001 was mainly new deals. Of course the whole thing is poisoned by reserve movements.

Subject:	Margin Capital requirement -- back of the envelope simulation study

Jayshree, 
As requested you will find attached the spreadsheet containing results ( capital required and capital required normalized by VAR) for three levels of underlying volumes.  The assumptions are numerous to list here -- so I list below only the major ones.
1.  Underlyings in Natgas with a flat term structure -- $ 3.0 per MMBtu
2.  A reasonable volatility term structure has been assumed
3.  A representative set of 20 counterparties of various credit ratings selected on the basis of their MTM position on a random day this year.
4. The reported capital required is for a month and so is the VAR number
5. The volumetric exposure for each counterparty was assumed to be proportional to the MTM position on the same date as in item3.
6. We started with a premise of zero MTM, zero collateral at the starting time  and zero threshold for margin calls all through.
7. The volume is distributed evenly between financial and physical contracts and across 60 forward months
8. No distinction has been made between physical and financial contracts
9. The margin calls are assumed to be a function of the exposure times a factor which varies from 0 to 1 as credit rating goes from AAA to D

The results are therefore ....
1.  the unnormalized results illustrate the trend of capital required with the volume multiplier but the absolute magnitude of the capital required is tied to the simulated VAR and hence to the underlying volume level assumed.

If you have anymore questions please feel to call Karthik Rajan, Tanya Tamarchenko or myself.

Regards,
Rabi De

Hi guys,

here is a simple template based on discussions with Vince and Rakesh.  It takes positions for a single commodity (physical and financial), collateral info, and calculates P&L and collateral needs over a one month horizon.

This can be expanded to add pictorial info, and other expenses, and any other details as needed.

This is just a first cut, please feel free to tear it apart as appropriate.

"Process for Tomorrow","Vince,

As you meet with employees one-on-one tomorrow, you will want to cover a few items with them.  These are some things we determined through reductions in other groups that work fairly well:

have Shirley or your team admin prepared to receive all returned equipment (laptops, cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, American Express cards, long distance calling cards, etc.)
have someone call Cingular to confirm that Enron accounts can be converted to personal accounts.  I believe there is a form that the employee would need to submit to Cingular prior to the termination date.
Shirley should coordinate with each employee to verify that all pre-petition expenses have been paid and that all post-petition expenses have been submitted for reimbursement.
Because you have some lead time, you might consider instructing employees on how they should leave their desk.  It is very helpful if employees can destroy old documents, return supplies to a central location and leave the desk clean.
In the past we have realized after an employee leaves that we may not have the right contact information when needing to get in touch with them.  Attached is a template to have your employees update their personal information to ensure that any corespondance is appropriately sent.
 

Khymberly and I will both be in your meeting tomorrow at 3pm.

Thanks,
Shanna

If you have deteriorating joints of any kind, joint heal will help regenerate that loss.  Joint Heal has
chicken collagen in it as well as the famed glucosamine sulfate.  It also has MSM in it along with
Chondroitin Sulfate.  One study quoted by chemist Robert Barefoot told of 387 chronic arthritic
patients, half in wheelchairs, who were treated with crushed chicken collagen and gelatin.  ALL
were improved and all were out of their wheelchairs in six weeks.  These types of stories do not get
publicized as do medications which can not work.  As the medications keep the individual in a
gradual decline, people need to realize how simple the answer really is.   Joint pain decreases
within three days or sooner as regeneration begins.
Joint Heal is 37.95 per bottle, 120 tablets. plus $5.95 shipping and handling.

Call 800-395-7379 to order by credit card.

Joint Heal is nothing like the normal joint products found in the Health food stores. Joint Heal was
created by an individual whose mother had knotted up hands from arthritis.  He worked years on a
formula that finally helped straightened her hands and has been selling it throughout the world for
4 years.  That product is Joint Heal.  Glucosamine sulfate alone can do only a fraction of what the
combination found in Joint Heal can do.  Below is the unmatched combination of ingredients found
in Joint Heal.

Vitamin C  100mg, MSM (Methyl-Sulfonyl-Methane)  750mg, Chicken Colagen 250gm, Chondroitin
Sulfate (from chicken sternal cartilage) Magnesium  200mg, Copper  500mcg, Manganese  5m,
Sodium (as glucosamine sulfate)  60mg, Glucosamine Sulfate 750mg,  Boron  750  mcg.

Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download

By Christopher Cormier

Welcome to this edition of Whitepaper Downloads.  Today we have
two new whitepapers for you to browse through. Starting off we
have a whitepaper from F-5 Networks.  In this whitepaper F-5
illustrates the features of their Internet Control Architecture
system. F5 outlines the challenges of maintaining a content
management system, including distribution, delivery and control
of content and applications.  Secondly we have a whitepaper from
Cisco which deals with using Intrusion Detecting Systems (IDS)
solutions.  As always we have indexed all the current whitpapers
on Network World Fusion at the end of this newsletter.


F-5 Networks
An Advanced Internet Control Architecture For Creating
Application Aware Networks

Many system administrators have struggled with the need to
integrate content delivery solutions and custom applications to
all points of their networks, while still managing costs.  This
F5 Networks whitepaper offers the company's solutions to these
problems.  The complexity of content management has stretched
the limits of many networks and has often resulted in loses,
temporary solutions and high costs.  With their content
management system F5 says it is able to avoid many of these
problems and allow centralized management of all points on a
network.  Click the link below to read more about F5's Internet
Control Architecture.
http://nww1.com/go/f5_wp1119.html


Cisco
Raising The Bar: Extending Cisco Intrusion Detection with A
Host-Based Solution

This paper examines the combination of the existing NIDS and
the new NIDS components in the Cisco IDS solution by exploring
relevant security issues. It continues with an analysis of the
extent of coverage provided by the combined solution and
examines how well the different components complement each
other.
http://nww1.com/go/cisco_wp1119.html


Winternals Software
Enterprise Defragmenters For Windows NT/2000: Cost and Benefits
Compared

In this whitepaper Winternals Software explains the impact of
defrag software.  Disk defragmentation is an area many
companies are exploring in an effort to cut costs.  According
to Winternals Software many defrag companies claim the use of
defrag software may have a cost savings of nearly $350 annually
per user.  Supported by figures and charts, Winternals Software
demonstrates how ambitious this number appears to be.  In
addition to the cost savings analysis, Winternals unveils other
possible hurdles involved with defrag software.  To provide you
with an alternative, Winternals Software introduces Defrag
Commander. In this article the functionality, effectiveness and
potential cost savings of Winternals' Defrag Commander is
explained.  Click the link below to see how Defrag Commander
may be a benefit your company and your budget.
http://nww1.com/go/winternals.html


Cisco
SAFE: A Security Blueprint for Enterprise Networks

Cisco, using design guideline sections and configuration
snapshots, has developed a blueprint for designing and
implementing a secure network.  In this whitepaper you can read
about the numerous potential holes typically exploited by
hackers.  Cisco describes various types of attacks, where they
originate, and suggestions on how to combat each type.  Cisco
also explains how hackers use all areas of the network for
their attacks, from routers to applications to hosts.  Along
with all the other features of this whitepaper, in Appendix B
is a Network Security Primer.  To see how Cisco recommends you
secure your network, click the link below.

Ultra DNS
Outsourced DNS Management: A New Service For Improving Web Site
Reliability

According to Keynote Systems 29% of connection errors are
related to DNS.  Also Keynote systems observes, DNS-related
errors are the second most frequent reason for failed Internet
connections.  Despite the percentage of DSN-related errors and
research supporting significantly improved customer satisfaction
by raising DNS' profile, typically management of DNS is limited.
By reading this whitepaper you will learn how many of these
problems could be averted by outsourcing DNS management.  To see
how outsorcing DNS management may benefit you click the link below.

"RE: visit Georgia Tech and QCF info","
Vince,

Thank you for your efforts in talking to your corporate recruiting
people.  Maybe we could figure something out next time.  For your trip on
Nov. 1, please let me know if you'd like us to book a hotel for you or
you'd like to make your own arrangement.  The tentative plan is that we
can go to dinner together on 10/31.  On 11/1, I am thinking about
having you meet with another faculty, I and a Ph.D student from 10am to
11am.  We are supervising the Ph.D. student on finding research topics in
bandwidth trading.  The seminar will be from 11am to noon.  Our QCF
director will take you to lunch after the seminar.  And at 2pm, we'd
like you to meet with our QCF students for an hour or so.  Let me know if
this sounds fine to you.

Please send me the title and abstract of your talk as soon as possible so
that I could make the announcement soon.  Thanks.

I have sent you one more version this morning. I hope you have that.

We are not a newspaper so it is not necessary for us to bother your press
spokesman.

I would be happy to keep in touch with you if you would find that useful. In
any event, I will treat this email exchange as a private matter between old
(in more ways than one!) friends.

Ed,

Thanks. I have forwarded your message to Mark Palmer, our
press spokesman. He has a full plate, as you might expect,
but I strongly suggested  that he should get in touch with you.

Sadly, this is my last day at Enron in Houston.  I've been here two years and 2 days, and have had a great time working here.  The longer I have been here, the better I have liked working here - probably because I got to know you all better.  If you are in New Zealand any time in the next 5 or 10 years, I would like you to stay at my house and update me on life at Enron - we will be living in Wellington, which is at the bottom of the North Island.

I am very pleased that you will be able to join our Advisory Board and I
look forward to introducing you to those of our Steering Committee you do
not already know as well as the other Advisory Board members at our next
meeting on December 12, 2001 in New York.

I would like to send you a more formal letter of acknowledgment and
appreciation but I realize I have only your e-mail address.   Could you

Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its scope.  I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust model off more comprehensive data to start with.

Cheers,

Subject:	Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical snapshot+performance data for model development

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots											Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end			12 month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end				12 month end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end					12 month end performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end				12 month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Regards,
Amitava

What's New at ERisk.com, 08 June 2001

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0ImL0Av
In this week&#8217;s economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise risk management perspective: corporate profits take their worst hit for a decade; tobacco firms face new legal risks; investment banks feel the effects of the deal drought; the SEC comes under fire; and catastrophe risk for insurers may be falling.

ANALYSIS
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0B4V0A2
Why insurers are making slow progress towards e-commerce.
Complaints amid the compliments: banks, associations and regulators respond
to Basle II.

VIEWPOINT
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0B4X0A4
As chief risk officer, Walter Smiechewicz was charged with developing an
enterprise risk management framework at Old Kent, a relatively unusual
undertaking for such a small firm. The bank&#8217;s recent merger with fellow
regional Fifth Third put an end to the programme, but as Smiechewicz tells
ERisk's Duncan Wood in our latest Q&A, it learnt a lot of valuable lessons
along the way.

JOB LISTINGS
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0Bie0AB
Among the opportunities posted in our Job Listings section this month: positions in corporate treasury, investment risk management and bank credit risk management.

ANNOUNCEMENTS
Later this month ERisk will begin running announcements of key personnel
changes, new product launches and other important company and industry news.
If you have an announcement you&#8217;d like to see featured on the world&#8217;s

"Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas","Dear Vince,

Risk Assessment and Porfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas, 23rd-24th
October, Holiday Inn, Victoria, London

I am producing the above conference and have been speaking with both Ron
Bain from Anadarko Petroleum and Soussan Faiz from Texaco who recommended
that I contact you. I understand that you have a wealth of experience in
real options and that this is an area that Enron is extremely committed to.
I would love to invite you to come along and speak as I think that you would
make a vital addition to the programme. Your colleague Shirley recommended
that I email some details over first of all - I hope you don't mind.

I have drawn up a draft programme (attached below) based on my research, but
please do bear in mind that this is very much a developing programme and if
you have any comments I'd really like to hear them. Also if you feel that
you would like to present an area that I have not covered in the programme
or would like me to rewrite a session I would be more than happy to do so.

I know that you are extremely busy and must get approached regularly to
speak at conferences, however I really do believe that this will be a
fantastic opportunity to publicise Enron as a leader across Europe. We will
be marketing this conference to over 40,000 targeted individuals, including
a direct mail of at least 25,000 and in addition an online and press
campaign.  We will be looking to work with leading industry press such as
Petroleum Review, Oil and Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine and Harts E&P and
can also undertake mailings for our speakers and sponsors to their contacts
and clients.

Just to let you know of my deadlines, I am working to a very tight deadline
and will need confirmation by Thursday 14th June if you are interested in
getting more involved in this programme.  I appreciate that this is very
short notice, but at this stage I would need very little from you.  You
would simply need to choose an appropriate session or I can adapt a short
abstract for you and I can co-ordinate with your assistant to get a
biography for the brochure.

I look forward to hearing from you soon and sincerely hope that you can make
it.

Kind Regards,

Alix

"RiskNews Update - 25/01/2002","Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 25/1/2002

The focus of investigations into the collapse of Enron turned to its derivatives trading business this week. Expert testimony in a US Senate hearing Thursday by Frank Partnoy, a professor in the University of San Diego School of Law, warned that profits the firm attributed to its derivatives operations may have been inflated due to systematic problems with the way Enron valued its positions and recorded them in its trading book. But Partnoy - who is currently researching a book about Enron's fall - failed to provide any hard evidence. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer refused to address the matter, stating Enron would not offer counterarguments to each testimony. To vote on whether derivatives played a key role in Enron's demise, visit http://www.risknews.net.

Meanwhile, Citibank and Soci?t? G?n?rale will sell warrants for the first time in the North American retail market on Monday, via the Bourse de Montr?al. The expansion is significant for the banks, both of which are market leaders in the warrants business, as it could open the way to selling the products to the US retail market. A tight US regulatory environment currently impedes the selling of warrants in the US.

Operational risk software and data vendors Raft International and OpVantage plan to integrate their respective op risk applications, Raft Radar and OpVar. US-based OpVantage was established in April last year when PricewaterhouseCoopers and NetRisk merged their op risk offerings. The firms believe the joint offering should allow users to manage their entire operational risk process from developing and collecting risk indicators through to calculating capital-at-risk.

On the people front, Lehman Brothers lured a 15-person equity barrier options team from rival CSFB. The move is the largest hiring spree in Lehman's two-year drive to boost its equity derivatives capability. The team will be led by Jerry Guthrie. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, hired Michel Iskander to head its OTC derivatives structuring business. Iskander, who has worked at JP Morgan since 1993, will manage a team of about 10 and report to Toshio Okumura.

This Appeal has been set up for the immediate families of, and any persons financially dependent on, those attending the Risk Waters financial technology conference on the 106th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, who lost their lives in the terrorist attack. Those attending the conference included many delegates, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors, as well as 16 people working for Risk Waters (UK, EU and US individuals).
The initial trustees of the Appeal Fund will be Peter Field (chairman & chief executive, Risk Waters Group Ltd), Dennis Waters (chairman & chief executive officer, GenomeWeb LLC, and director, Risk Waters Group Ltd) and Andrew Farley (solicitor, Boodle Hatfield, London). Risk Waters Group Ltd will be able to appoint new or additional trustees.
The trustees of the Fund will have discretion over how and to what extent to benefit individual claimants and their decisions will be final. As long as the trustees act honestly and in good faith they will not be legally liable for the exercise of their discretion nor for any loss that may occur to the funds raised, howsoever caused. The Fund will not itself be a charity, but any surplus will be applied for such charitable purposes as the trustees think most appropriate to commemorate those who died.

     The Bachelier Finance Society was founded in 1996 by a group of
  researchers in Mathematical Finance to serve as a platform where
  academics and practitioners can meet and exchange ideas spanning across
  Mathematics, Finance, Economics, Econometrics and Insurance. To achieve
  this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.
     The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary
  talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an
  overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will
  also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,
  Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems
  in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will
  complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.
      The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for
  discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the
  fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future
  development of Mathematical Finance.

Monthly Newsletter

Let's describe a typical and recurring nightmare for generating unit
operators. It's noon on August 15, temperatures have reached the upper 90s
all week; you're well into your reserve margin to serve native load, when a
unit trips off line. Do you scramble to find replacement power at record
high prices and worry about the consequences later? Or, have you prepared
for this event?

When the degree of risk has not been quantified, fear of the unknown can
lead to restless nights, and understandably so. The financial implications
can be astounding when a unit outage occurs during a period of high spikes
in market prices.

How does this relate to the recruitment and hiring of talent within your
shop? Allow me to bring the story together. What would you do if your top
employee came to you and said, ""You've been great to me and I've learned
alot, but I just accepted a job at your level right down the road and they
like me so much they want me to start tomorrow."" Do you spring into 911 mode
or are you ready for this day.

On other matters, I wonder if your firm would be interested in hiring some
of our very outstanding finance grads. We have an undergraduate, MBA, M.Sc.
and Ph.D. program. I could provide you with more information if you would
like.

Vince, I received a message that the first message was not delivered and
hence am resending. I apologize if you in fact receive two messages.


Hi Vince,

During our chat at the Texas Finance Festival you spoke of the need to hire
technically competent yet creative individuals. I know of someone you might
be interested in.

We run an M.Sc. program in Finance at UBC. One of our graduates came into
our program with a Ph.D in physics and went on to be one of our top
graduates. He spent his summer at the Bank of Canada and they hired him upon
graduation. He is currently in their Calgary office. I happened to be
corresponding with him recently and he mentioned that he would like to leave
the Bank but stay in Calgary. I thought of Enron as a possibility and
wondered if you thought there would be some interest. I think he would make
an outstanding contribution to any firm he worked for.

I hope you don't mind this imposition but I didn't want potential gains from
trade to pass by. If you are interested, please let me know.

Hope all is well with you.

Cheers

EIA to Display Draft of New Storage Survey at GasMart/Power 2002

Dulles, VA -- January 25, 2002-The Energy Information Administration will display its plans for a new weekly natural gas storage survey, as part of an extensive program exploring the wholesale gas and power markets at GasMart/Power 2002, March 18-20 in Reno, NV, hosted by Intelligence Press, Inc.
In a special session Wednesday, March 20, 2002, EIA Senior Analyst Roy Kass will outline the agency's new weekly natural gas storage survey which will replace the current survey conducted by the American Gas Association. Due for release in early May, EIA's survey is expected to become the most critical piece of data informing the market. During the conference, attendees also will be able to visit EIA's Showcase area to see and discuss with its creators, the draft version of the agency's new product.
In other sessions at the 16th annual GasMart/Power forum key natural gas and power representatives will come together to hear about strategies in the current low energy price, high security environment, and --- the impact on the competitive market of the collapse of Enron, the market's largest and most zealous supporter.
Keynoter Richard Sherrill, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of Duke Energy North America will assess the state of the wholesale natural gas and power market, offering his strategies for instilling customer confidence in the face of the wrenching market disruptions of the last few years. He also will offer his views as to the market share for electronic trading and the outlook for electric restructuring? 
Energy guru Ben Schlesinger will explore the impact of Enron's collapse on other marketers; on rules and regulations; and on the political scene.  Will Congress intervene to re-control gas and power prices?  How long will energy investors shy away from major commitments?  Are we in for another boom-bust price cycle? Did the skyrocketing energy prices in California and other parts of the nation in the latter half of 2000 and early 2001 carry the seeds of the current bust, weakening industrial customers, bankrupting the largest marketer, and ultimately reversing gains in the competitive market?
In others of the 18 sessions at GasMart/Power 2002, Dynegy Vice President Peter Esposito and Jim Macias, Sr. Vice President of Calpine tell what's ahead for power generation. ?Williams Energy Marketing & Trading President Bill Hobbs and TXU Vice President Jeff Shorter assess the winter...Futures analyst Cynthia Kase instructs on technical market analysis ?
FERC's Shelton Cannon, Deputy Director, Office of Markets, Tariffs & Rates, explores RTO development and the standardization of market design and market rules?Representatives of the California Energy Commission, the Cal-ISO, the Western Power Trading Forum, Bonneville Power Administration and Southern California Gas discuss various aspects of western gas and power markets? 
Gordon Shearer, Poten Partners, and TransCanada Vice President Steve Becker report the latest developments on the LNG and Arctic gas fronts?and Richard Sharples, Senior VP, Marketing & Minerals, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Arthur L. Smith, Chairman & CEO, John S. Herold, Inc. strategize on how to survive for the long haul in E&P. 
The annual GasMart/Power conference is sponsored by Intelligence Press Inc., publisher of the industry's real time, daily and weekly publications, Natural Gas Intelligence, NGI's Daily Gas Price Index, Power Market Today and NGI's Weekly Gas Price Index.

"Launch of Bauer College Energy Committee - November 14, 2001, 5PM - 7PM","
We want to personally thank you for agreeing to join the Energy Committee of
the C.T. Bauer College of Business Dean's Advisory Board (Current Committee
Members Attached).  The Committee is a terrific group of people with a
diverse background that will represent exceedingly well the needs of the
Houston energy community.  As a member of the Energy Committee, you also
become a member of the Dean's Advisory Board, which is having its next
meeting on January 17, 2002.  This Dean's Advisory Board Meeting will
include the grand opening ceremonies for the new AIM Center for Investment
Management in the Bauer College.  Please mark your calendar for January 17,
2002 for this important event.

We are delighted and excited about the Energy Market Center of Excellence
and look forward to your leadership in guiding and shaping its rapid
evolution (Draft Business Plan attached).  Our first meeting of the Energy

"","Vince, 
just wanted to summarize for you how I see the issues related to Credit Reserve and Var models:

Credit Reserve:
In order to address RAC's requests and questions related to this model Research needs to be able to
compile and run the code. These procedures are not straight forward. Compilation and running can be done by 
using some scripts prepared by IT. Runs by different users can interfere with each other and with production runs.
All this involves knowledge of Java, Corba, multi-threading, etc. and our IT's specific implementations, files locations....
We need IT support in doing this. I asked RAC (Debbie Brackett), IT (Winston, Steve Stock) for this. The reaction 
was not positive. I even guess they assume that I struggle for the ""ownership"" of the code. Our calls to IT guys
are considered as interruptions in their work.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Var Model:
""Convolution VAR"" (Naveen's approach) is under way. At the end of this month (according to IT) it will more or less work.
It is based on 60 factor model (which I suggested, but which was not implemented for our Monte Carlo model). There
will be no way to perform proper testing of the ""convolution VAR"" even for normal distributions (in this case - Analytical VAR).
There are no plans of such testing, as far as I know.
What will happen is comparison with backtesting for our 5000 portfolios and then endless discussions which portfolios'
VAR numbers are ""better"" or ""worse"" for the new method. 
________________________________________________________________________________________

"1 factor HJM for the propane project","

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dear Adam,

In the past we have not forecasted GDP numbers, therefore we are looking at outside sources and their consensus.  The estimated time frame is around two to three weeks, hopefully sooner.

Japan
South Korea
Taiwan
Singapore
Hong Kong

They will be used just as overall indicators of these countries economic health and get a general feel for how much additional or less coal they will likely need.

Adam,

I'm sorry its taken me so long to get back to you on your request for ASIAN GDP for the Coal desk in London. 

Presently, we do not forecast GDP for specific countries in the Research Group, other than in the US.  However, we do have access to several sources for this information.

If you can describe in more detail what data you need, I'll try to be of assistance to you.

Please provide the following: 

country name 
economic indicator needed (e.g. Real GDP growth rate)
how many years in the future forecast is needed for
how the data will be used by your business unit

I am not sure if our data sources forecast GDP for the Asian region as a whole, but will do so for individual countries.

Thanks,

Gwyn Koepke

Vince --

I see that you are on the panel on market monitoring.  Dave Perrino and Alan Comnes are following the issue for Enron in the Western power markets as RTOs are formed.  It may make sense for some people from Govt Affairs to talk with you to discuss current issues and focus of FERC and others?  If we can get together, please let me know a good time.

Also, the attached paper from EPSA on Market Monitoring is something we support through our trade association.

Thanks,

Jim

To All,

Below is the announcement of a Market Monitoring workshop to be held in San Francisco on November 16.  There is a fee to attend of $50.00.  The scope of the meeting is to discuss market monitoring in the west.  The workshop is hosted by the CAISO and co-sponsored by RTO West and WestConnect.  I am planning on attending and I'm guessing Alan and Sue will want to attend as well.  You'll see on the agenda, that the friend of the market - Anjali Sheffrin is on the first panel, so expect an action packed day!  And our own Vince Kaminsky is on panel 3 (Christi, do you know Vince and should we check with him on any positions we have?).

Kind Regards,

Dave

                      C A L L   F O R   P A P E R S


     The Bachelier Finance Society was founded in 1996 by a group of
  researchers in Mathematical Finance to serve as a platform where
  academics and practitioners can meet and exchange ideas spanning across
  Mathematics, Finance, Economics, Econometrics and Insurance. To achieve
  this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.
     The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary
  talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an
  overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will
  also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,
  Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems
  in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will
  complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.
      The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for
  discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the
  fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future
  development of Mathematical Finance.

"MS 150 Report","
Dear  Friends and Family:
 
It  was Saturday morning at 5:30AM when I arrived at Tully Stadium, the start for  the MS 150.  The weather was the  warmest of any of the 3 previous MS 150's I road.  By 6:30AM, 9,000+ riders were lined up  looking forward to our 100-mile journey for the day.  This year there was a lot of press  coverage as the ride was dedicated to Maxine Mesinger.  Maxine, a long time sufferer of MS, and  society columnist for the Houston Chronicle, died this past year of  complications from MS.  British  Petroleum had 580 riders edging out Enron as the first corporate team to go  out.  Enron had the second start  with 450 riders and I was among one of the first people out along with the other  Enron top fundraisers including Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron and two riders with  MS.  Enron was the top fundraising  team from the 2000 MS 150.   
 
The  cannon went off and I kicked into high gear.  I flew with the fastest riders and after  about ? a mile I could not keep up with them.  I was able to maintain a speed of 22  miles an hour, crossing the Katy prairie while the race teams that started  behind us were passing me.  My first  stop was break point three, 39 miles into the ride, and 1 hour and 45 minutes  later.  The weather was already  feeling hot and humid.  I  replenished my water supply and continued the next 15 miles to lunch.  It was hilly but we still had a tail  wind.  I arrived at lunch at 10AM in  Bellville, TX, 55 miles from the start.   I found the Enron lunch spot with our catered lunch.  
 
After  a quick lunch I headed up to Industry, TX, population 475, which does not  appreciate 9,000+ riders going though their small town.  You need to make sure you stop at the  one stop sign in town or you will get a ticket.  Luckily there was a police officer  directing traffic, as there was at almost all intersections along the route of  country roads.  I made my third stop  of the day in Industry at breakpoint five, where I had to stretch.   The hills were getting harder and  the tail wind was now a crosswind.   Coming up on breakpoint seven 90 miles on route, a truck and crosswind  almost blew the bikes off the road.   The sign said it was now 7.6 miles to the finish of the day.  The next 7.6 miles were fine, but it was  an additional 3 miles to the finish with hills and a strong head  wind
 
Last  year I upgraded to a new bike with a triple.  I was able to keep a slow but steady  pace up the hills by getting into the granny gear.  I arrived in La Grange, TX at 2:20PM, 7  hours and 20 minutes later to many cheering supporters.   I was done for Day 1!
 
I  headed over to the Enron tent, the largest tent in La Grange.  After checking in, I gulped two large  bottles of ice water, and signed-in for a massage.  Enron had 30 massage therapists working  to sooth the tired and weary riders.   After my massage I felt totally relaxed.  Ilene found me in the Enron tent having  a beer.  It took Ilene about an hour  to find me since our cell phones did not work well in La Grange due to limited  cell capacity.  Every year Enron has  a large barbeque in the Enron tent and this year the food was even better.  While in the tent I was talking to some  other Enron riders and I learned that some came in as early as  10:45AM!
 
The  next morning at 4:45AM, it was time to get up.  Ilene and I arrived at the fairgrounds  at 5:30AM.  I headed over to  hydration station to refill my water bottles and stretched before the 7:00AM  start.  I was one of the first 50  people in line.  At exactly 7AM, we  were let out; normally we are delayed for fog.  It was warmer than the day before and we  had more hills ahead of us.
 
The first 20 miles  were relatively uneventful except I was able to carry on 20-minute conversation  with Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron.   Then came the downhill where you can reach speeds over 40 mph without  trying, the park is now only 3 miles away.   The park has a very hilly, curvy, and dangerous route lasting 10  miles.  I stopped right inside the  park to refill water and get some snacks.   I was really glad that I had the new bike with the triple, as I was able  to get up hills with little effort while others were struggling or walking their  bikes.  That was until killer hill,  which I did not remember being too difficult.  After the downhill there was the  uphill.  I tried to shift into that  wonderful granny gear but it was too late.   I noticed the pedaling was extremely easy and I was slowing almost to a  stop.  I looked down at my chain and  it jumped off the gear.  I yelled  ""oh no!""  I was able to get my foot  out and prevent myself from falling.   The hill I fell on years past was easy.  I headed out of the park to lunch at the  50-mile point, it was 10AM.  When I  pulled into lunch I saw Ilene who was working the lunch, she was very happy to  see me and I was happy to see her.   I took a short break and headed out to Austin.
 
After lunch, the cloud cover  was gone and it was hot.  I stopped  twice in the remaining 35 miles for water.   The last 15 miles were into the wind or with a very strong cross  wind.  At approximately 12:30PM,  five hours and thirty minutes later, I pulled into the finish line with many  supporters cheering the riders on.   I saw Ilene several minutes after I arrived.  I was elated that I completed the  175-mile ride from Houston to Austin for the 4th time and now I was ready for a  beer or two and some lunch.
 
This year's ride was  magnificent!   It was a real  pleasure to see several people with MS ride the bike tour.  The law enforcement personnel directing  traffic was helpful as they kept safe and us moving.  The support staff and volunteers that  provided water and food at breakpoints and lunch were awesome.  Not to mention Ilene supporting me all  the way to Austin!  I would also  like to thank my donors that have helped me raise over $21,000 for MS and I am  still counting.  I would like to see  this number reach $30,000 towards a cure for MS. 
 
If you still would like your  contribution to help send a check by May 11 it should be made out to the  National MS Society and sent to the address below or drop it by 2604A in  the Enron building.

"Hello & Thanks for the Call","John:

I received your voice mail upon return to the office this morning.  I'm sorry the schedules did not match up yesterday but certainly hope the next opportunity to meet will not be long in coming.  I was most impressed with the quality of students interviewed on campus yesterday.  Likewise, I have now had a chance to meet some of those we have hired while I was in London.  The high standard clearly continues.  

Concerning your reference to the annual finance conference, I have kept up with each event from a distance.  Memory serving, it has been about four years since the concept was first considered.  Time flies!  Others have also said that it is a real success.  Many thanks to you and others at Baylor for the time and effort dedicated to date.

Let me know when you have plans to be in Houston in the future.  I'll do the same when in Waco.  Pass on my well wishes to others at the Business School including Dr.(s) Rose and Petty.  I did have a chance to visit with Dr. Maness by phone and exchanged v-mails with Dr. Rose.


All The Best,

Steve Young

"PSIM progress","Hi all, 
We have updated the PSIM model. The current version can handle more realistic
operational constraints by selecting ""Semi Optimal Dispatch"" toggle for Dispatch 
Mode. This dispatch mode considers minimum up hours, minimum down hours,
ramp-up hours, start up cost, fuel switching cost, forward looking within a 
user-specified period of time. It also allows user to enter their estimate of ISO 
curtailment on their generation capacity by month in ""Asset"" page.

You need to put Frontera.dll in your C:\Winnet directory, and the spreadsheet and
help files in one directory of your choice.

"RE: Scott's concerns about the Public Firm Models","Hi Iris,

I also have copies of and have read the documents you mention; while they contain some good information, especially the movement model plan, the meeting summary is just that...a very general summary of a meeting with recommendations like ""hire quants and make sure there is adequate communication among the different teams"".  The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying ""be aware of the time dimension"" which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade.    

Perhaps you didn't understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report.  We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned.  As I'm sure you recall, the teleconference with Vince, Vasant, and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models, the scope of the project, and data acquisition considerations.  After the call, you suggested to Bryan, Eric, Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in George's 2 documents (movement model and meeting summary).  My personal hope, echoed by Bryan at that time, was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model, as you surely learned in your visit, is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail.    

I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated, team-oriented approach.  I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference.

Best regards,
Scott

FYI - George joined the company in Sep 2000 so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April 2000.

Subject:	RE: Scott's concerns about the Public Firm Models



Hi Scott, 	
 

	How are you?  Thanks for your email.

	I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said. 

	Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the ""issues"" with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.  

	In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:
		1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000
		2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.  

	I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you can't find them, I will forward them again.

	Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to ""repair"" the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.




Regards,
Iris

Subject:	Report to Professor Duffie

Hi Iris,

I wasn't sure if you had already sent your report to Professor Duffie yet or not, but I've been thinking about ways that his group (or the Research team) could really add value in an area where we're admittedly weak - model testing.  If you haven't sent the report to him yet, perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets.  Obviously, I'd like to discuss this in detail with you as well, especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now, but I'll do that via phone.  I'm hoping there are some statistical techniques we're currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy.

If you've got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the D&B issues, I'd love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and we're starting a model recalbration phase.  I'm least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once we've recalibrated them.

Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday.

Regards,
Scott

GENERATORS/POWER MARKETERS FERC Post-Meeting Memo for October 24,  2001 
Highlights 
At Wednesday's  Commission meeting, generators scored a major victory with the Commission's  order setting a new interim generator interconnection policy whereby  transmission owners must pay interest to generators for interconnection costs  for system upgrades needed to interconnect. Commissioner Massey, although  supporting the order only on an interim basis, said that ""if the generator is  going to used as a bank, it should be paid interest."" Chairman Wood continues to  be ""uncomfortable with generators being the bank."" 
The remainder of the  meeting focused on establishing processes for continued development of RTOs.  Within that framework, the Commissioners discussed the status of the Southeast,  Northeast and Midwest RTOs. Chairman Wood, although joking of the less than  pleasant comments made by the Chairman of the Maryland Public Service  Commission, Catherine Riley, and many other state commissioners at last week's  RTO Conference, acknowledged that the FERC took heed to the state commissions'  concerns and will involve state commissions in the decision-making process and  formation of the RTOs going forward. To back that up, Commissioner Brownell  proposed the creation of a ""regional panel"" consisting of state commissions and  FERC staff. This new panel will offer a forum for all regulatory bodies to  provide input in the RTO process. Commissioner Brownell's proposal was supported  by all three commissioners, although Commissioner Massey expressed a little  reservation. 
It seems that the Commissioner is taking steps in that  direction by convening the Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference to be held  during the Western Governor's Association Meeting in Seattle, WA on November 2.  This conference, too, was aimed at strengthening relationships with the states  and involving them in the decision-making process. 
In addition, the  Commission extends bid caps for the ISO NE and NY ISO markets, addresses the  issue of costs responsibility for interconnections and allows virtual bidding in  the NY ISO real-time market. 
These and other proceedings are  reported below. If you would like copies of any orders, please contact us.  
Commission Discussion  
FERC Orders Transmission Providers to Pay Interest to  Generators for System Upgrades 
It is clear that the Commission is  taking a serious look at the current interconnection policies and is not afraid  to revisit earlier FERC policy to make sure that they get it right. In a  dramatic move, FERC changed policy course and ordered on rehearing that Indiana  Michigan Power Company pay DPL Energy, Inc. interest on the transmission credits  it will receive from Indiana to repay it for interconnection costs associated  with system upgrades of facilities. 
Chairman Wood believes that the  transmission owner ""should both construct and take responsibility for getting  transmission built"". Wood went on to say that ""generators should do what they do  best"" ...and ""not be the bank"". 
Commissioner Massey tried to stress that  his support of this order is only on an interim basis: "" My long-term view has  not yet been formulated... I have an open mind about how to price  interconnection costs."" However, Massey supported this order because he believed  that "" if a generator is going to be used as a bank, it should be paid  interest."" 
Commissioner Breathitt, on the other hand, was the lone  dissenter on this order. Commissioner Breathitt called this item for discussion  in conjunction with six other interconnection-related proceedings being  considered on this agenda (E-7;E-10;E-12;E-17; and E-17). This policy shift is  to be applied prospectively. In support of her dissent, Breathitt said that she  ""was not convinced that this order adequately counters the July order which  denied rehearing on this very issue. Commissioner Breathitt also stated that she  believed it premature to address interconnection issues and cost responsibility  in light of the Commission's earlier announcement that it will issue an ANOPR on  generator interconnection procedures and costs allocation issues.  
American Electric Power ER01-2163-001  
FERC To Establish Regional Panels to Facilitate RTO  Formation 
At the request of Commissioner Brownell, FERC will  establish regional panels to help facilitate information exchange and  collaboration between FERC and the state commissions. This decision is a direct  result of the Commission responding to comments voiced by many state commissions  at last week's RTO ""Boot Camp"". It was clear that the state commissions have  felt like they have been left out of the RTO debate and process. So to remedy  that going forward, FERC has recommended the creation of this regional panel  structure. The goal of this regional panel is to strengthen relationships with  the states, help FERC with problem-solving, and bring more efficiency to this  RTO process. The Commissioners have recommended that this newly created  structure within FERC have a dedicated staff and serve as sort of a ""one-stop  shop"" for states to retrieve and exchange information with FERC.  
Chairman Wood expressed his support for this initiative and thanked  Commissioner Brownell for her vision. Wood also spelled out what he sees as the  duties of this regional panel: (1) setting up RTOs; (2) addressing transmission  cost and infrastructure issues; (3) devise demand-side response mechanisms; (4)  help develop market monitoring and market mitigation programs; and (5) consider  best use of ""distributed generation"". Chairman Wood said that he would like this  panel to look at the use of ""distributed generation"" on his behalf. Although  conceding that distributed generation ""looks more like a retail issue"", Chairman  Wood went on to say that he and the Commissioners would do everything it could  to help assist the states in that process. 
Even though Commissioner  Massey supported the order, he did, however, voice his frustration over the  continuous use of conferences and other forums aimed at developing regional  transmission organizations that have yet to yield the desired result: ""It is my  belief that we have had a lot of process.. if we need more we ought to structure  it so to get to the 'end game'."" 
ALJ's Discuss RTO Mediation  Reports and Recommendations 
Southeast RTO Mediation  
The Commission heard presentations by staff and both the  Administrative Law Judge presiding over the Southeast and Northeast RTO  meditations. FERC staff signaled the audience that ""governance is where this  discussion will focus."" Identifying the unique nature of this mediation process,  Judge Bobbi Mc Cartney viewed this as a ""new approach to mediation"" in which she  now terms as a ""market-based mediation"" approach. In Judge McCartney's summary  of her Southeast mediation report, she recommended that out of the two  governance models that rose from the Southeast RTO Meditations, the  Collaborative Governance Model ""represented the most fully-developed model.""  Judge McCartney went so far as to highlight several components of the  GridFlorida RTO model: ""It [GridFlorida] has a nicely prepared for-profit  Transco model."" 
Interestingly, FERC staff, in its presentation, stated  that both models satisfied compliance with Order 2000. However, upon questioning  by Commissioner Massey, staff conceded that the alternate ""Independent System  Administrator (ISA)"" model may NOT fully comply with Order 2000 and may need  additional work to bring it in compliance. Apparently wearing two hats, Judge  McCartney's mediation advisor, Chairman Herb Tate, expressed his preference for  the ISA model. He stated that public power entities and states may be more  ""comfortable"" with this model because of its similarity to the Independent  System Operator (ISO) model currently in place in the Northeast. 
Both  Judge McCartney and Chairman Tate called on the Commission to take this report  and build from it. Judge McCartney made it very clear that the findings were  limited to the narrow scope she was asked to address. Judge McCartney only  looked at the filings made in the Southeast RTO dockets and made no comparisons  to other region's RTO proposals. Because of that limitation, Judge McCartney and  Chairman Tate asked the Commission to do what they did not have an opportunity  to. 
Ultimately, the Commissioners were very impressed by the results of  the Southeast RTO meditations, but recognized that much more needs to be  explored and resolved:(1) who does transmission planning; (2) how do you  preserve the low-cost energy while restructuring the wholesale market?; and (3)  should sub-regional RTOs still be allowed to continue developing knowing that  they will be superseded by the creation of a supra regional RTO?  (EX02-2; RT01-100 GridSouth; RT01-34 Southwest Power Pool; RT01-75  Entergy Services; RT01-77 Southern Company Services)  
Northeast RTO  Mediation 
Discussions on the Northeast RTO Meditations went  very much like the Southeast. Judge Peter Young summarized his findings from the  Northeast mediation with assistance by his mediation advisor via telephone, Joe  Garcia. The Northeast mediation did not concentrate on substantive issues and  structures, instead it concentrated on process and timelines. The meditations  yielded three options stakeholders offered for consideration: Option I-M; Option  2-M; and Option 3-M. Judge Young expressed his favor with Option I-M. However,  again, the advisors and Judges were split on the appropriate model to use going  forward. Joe Garcia recommended to the FERC the use of the 3-M Option, since it  garnered the most ""broad based support"" from industry mediation participants.  
Without committing to one model or the other, Chairman Wood did,  however, state that ""Option 2 has some attractiveness"" because of the of the  shortened time frame for implementation. (EX02-1-000; RT01-99 PJM; RT01-98  PJM-West; New York ISO RT01-95) 
Midwest RTO Developments  
The Midwest RTO discussions took a different approach beginning  with a staff presentation that highlighted the status of both the Alliance RTO  and the Midwest RTOs. From the FERC staff presentation, it seemed as if the  staff portrayed the Midwest ISO as the more progressive of the two RTOs before  them. Of particular note, Commissioner Breathitt pointed out that Southwest  Power Pool had announced its plan to merge with the Midwest ISO, which could  address Commission's concern that its scope was too small. Looking to gain more  intelligence on the announced proposed merger of MISO and SPP, the Commissioners  asked Jim Torgenson of MISO to join the panel and answer staff questions. The  Commissioners were very concerned with the possibility of seams between the two  areas,( i.e. Midwest ISO and SPP). Mr. Torgenson quieted those concerns by  telling the Commission that there will be ""no seams""... ""they will function as  one."" Under the new proposed structure, Jim Torgeson will become CEO of the  newly created and named structure and Nick Brown will assume the position of COO  for the new structure. In addition, the Midwest ISO/SPP RTO will seat an  entirely new independent 11 person board. 
Representatives from the  Alliance RTO were not given the same opportunity to update the Commissioners on  their RTO progress. The Commissioners only had the staff presentation  summarizing what the Alliance had filed in its most recent status report  afforded to them. In the presentation, staff noted that the Alliance RTO would  not be operational by the December 15 RTO start-up date, but that the Midwest  ISO intended to be. 
Much of the Midwest discussion centered around the  viability of ""stand-alone"" transcos and for-profit transcos within the RTO  structure. Commissioner Breathitt stated that she ""hope(s) to see a stand-alone  transmission company."" she went on to say that with regards to Transcos, ""maybe  it is a time that has not yet come."" With so much uncertainty surrounding the  Midwest and other regions, Commissioner Brownell instructed the Commission no to  allow these ""models to be exposed in the market while we [FERC] tincker.""  Commissioner Massey made a statement along the same lines asking for the  Commission to consider ""what functions do investors need to invest in RTOs"" that  could make the investments more appealing. It is conceivable that this  uncertainty in the market surrounding the creation of RTOs, both for-profit and  not-for-profit could deter much needed investment in these models.  (EX02-3; RT01-87 Midwest ISO/Alliance; EL01-80 National Grid USA) -  
The message the Commissioners got across at Wednesday's  meeting is that it will attempt to give people certainty by proceeding in a  manner that will involve the necessary parties to bring RTOs into fruition. (1)  perform an updated cost-benefit analysis of creating RTOs; (20 issue a NOPR on  RTOs that spell out what the Commission is looking for compliance; (3) issue an  interconnection ANOPR to resolve a huge outstanding issue that could impact  functionality of RTOs; (4) create regional councils to facilitate collaboration  between states and FERC; and (5) issue a NOPR on Open Access Tariffs to guide  the industry in fashioning tariffs. 
Discussion of Western  Infrastructure Adequacy Conference AD01-2 
The staff started off the  presentation by stating that it views this conference as a ""fact-finding  mission"". Staff proceeded to lay out three questions the FERC will attempt to  answer through this conference: (1) Is current infrastructure adequate?; (2)  What are the infrastructure needs in the West?; and (3) What factors are  inhibiting adequate investment in infrastructure? In addition to those  questions, staff is looking to address offsets of those larger contextual  questions: (a) what is the outlook for population and growth of demand in the  West; (b) Why isn't needed infrastructure being built? what are the barriers?  (c) What can FERC and the states do to increase investment in the West? Chairman  Wood ended the discussion by stating that ""what is good for the West is good for  the rest of the country."" So, we can probably expect FERC to move forward with a  series of regional discussions similar to this conference in the West.  
Individual Contested Proceedings  
Bid Caps/ Market Mitigation  
New York ISO ER01-3001-000  - The Commission granted the NY ISO an extension of its  $1,000 bid cap until which time a Northeast RTO becomes operational. The  Commission also directed the NY ISO to file semiannual reports on the progress  of its efforts to implement programs that could minimize occurrence of extreme  prices, e.g. demand-side management programs. In addition, as condition for  approval of an extension for the use of the NY ISO's Temporary Extraordinary  Procedures (TEP), the NY ISO must file within 30 days a more defined set of  procedures for triggering TEP in the market. 
ISO New England  ER01-3086-000 - The Commission granted the ISO-NE an extension of  its $1,000 bid cap until such time as a Northeast RTO becomes operational.  
Morgan Stanley Capital Group v.  NY  ISO EL00-90-000; ER01-3009;ER01-3153-000 - The Commission accepted  the proposal to allow virtual bidding, (i.e. bidding of non-physical generation  and load) in the NY ISO's real-time market. The Commission also accepted the  NYISO's revised Market Mitigation Measures aimed at addressing potential gaming  or market power that may result from the introduction of virtual bidding.  
Generator  Interconnection 
New York  Independent System Operator, Inc.  ER01-2967-000   The Commission addressed the issue of cost responsibility for  interconnection by ruling that generators may only be assigned costs of System  Upgrade Facilities to the extent that these costs are not already in the  ""Baseline Assessment"". In addition, siding with generator arguments, the  Commission also ordered the NY ISO to delete from its tariff its ""Material  Impact Standards"" without prejudice. 
Market  Complaints 
E-19 San Diego  Gas & Electric Co.  v.   Sellers of Energy EL00-95-034; EL00-98-038 - Order on the CA  ISO's compliance filing proposing a new generator outage and maintenance  coordination plan. Dynegy and other protesters allege that the CA ISO is  attempting to circumvent FERC and ""seize control of the outage monitoring""  function that is currently FERC' s responsibility and role.  
Pacificorp Power Marketing ER01-2685-000 - The  Commission accepts Pacificorp Power Marketing's request to withdraw its filing  of a 10-year power Purchasing Agreement contract with the California Department  of Water Resources. Attempting to comply with a Commission order in the Southern  Case rescinding waiver and requiring that all long-tern power contacts be filed  with the Commission in place of submitting quarterly power marketing reports,  Pacificorp filed its long-term contract and later realized that the waiver was  still in effect at the time it made the power contract filing.  
Mirant et al.  v.  ISO New England, Inc.   EL01-93-001 - The Commission granted NSTAR's clarification  request and directed the ISO NE to file with the Commission all  mitigation contracts negotiated under Market Rule 17, effectively  eliminating the discretion the ISO NE attempted to exercise.  
E-30 Calpine Eastern Corp.,   Mirant et al.  v.  ISO New  England EL01-124-000 - The Commission agreed with Calpine and  granted its complaint ordering the ISO NE to include external energy contracts  in its calculation of the energy clearing price and Real-time Marginal Price  during non-OP4 conditions in the ISO's market.

"RE: Power and Gas Trading","Hello Rakesh and Gwen,
 
 
I am sorry that I have been out of pocket all week and did not have access to my e-mail.  I have just returned from NY and want to thank you for all of your hard work in helping us track the data.  You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.   I apologize for making numerous requests but everything that you have provided us will be useful to SSB.  
 
SSB has been provided with some information.  They will be incorporating the information that you have provided as well as information from the traders in their board presentations.  At this stage, I believe that we have done all that we can.  If I hear something further, I will let you know on Monday.
 
Again, thank you very much for all of your help.

Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

"RE: PLEASE READ -Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power","Slava,
    We were involved in the reconciliation efforts Wed/Thur, and am glad that the confusion has now abated.  A broader issue is the concept that even the (lower) spreasheet VaR does not backtest well.  Couple of reasons for that:
(1) The P/L valuation, viz-a-viz the spreadoption, might not be using the same inputs as the VaR calculation (vols and correlations between primary curves).
(2) Having said point (1), I would still be more comfortable having the current RiskTrac number (25MM), as a provision for the spurious nature of the back-end curve movements (the backend does not move, so your P/L would be small, however, we still have tremendous back-end risk (if you look at the PL swings, you would see discrete large jumps in P/L, suggesting this phenomenon).  
Let us know how the RiskTrac usage progress.

Subject:	PLEASE READ -Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power

This mail is the third in the series regarding the acceptance of RiskTrac VaR for UK Power. Please see the previous 2 days which will provide the history.

Essentially we have now reached the stage where we can explain the jump in VaR from moving from the VaR spread sheet to RiskTrac based largely on the good work that Fergus Trenholme - London Risk Management and Stig Faltinsen - London Research have done  (it has been a team effort as many others have been called in as appropriate and I would like to thank them too).

A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are:

the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the 2 systems but not completely (including the change in factor loadings)
the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the 2 systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the (primary and secondary) component curves in RiskTrac. In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though 75% of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve

As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on. That said does the VaR number sound right ? The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market ?The RiskTrac calculated $25m VaR is a 1 day VaR and the  methodology would imply it should be broken 1 in 20 business days. Based on historical P&Ls this has not been the case and so it does not pass the ""sense check"". (note that the original $13m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year).

There are many potential explanations why, but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end (ie only the first 2 years) and the component VarR for this period is in the order of $8m. This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high. The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to ""jumps"" or ""shocks"".  The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not  captured in the current VaR calculation.

Outstanding issues / work

Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves. The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified. Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days / week(s) and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list.

Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR  number  / methodology being calculated / employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the 1 day earnings risk for 19 out of 20 days. It would also be appropriate, given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio, to assess the fat tail risk being run.

I am away for the next 2 weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates.

Subject:	Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power

Due to recent variances in UK Power VaR between the VaR spreadsheet (SS) model and RisktRAC (RT), despite small differences in Net Open Positions,  London Research and Risk Management have investigated these discrepancies with the results as below. 

COB 14 May 2001data was chosen as a test example 

			DPR			RT
NOP (TWh) 		43.460		42.255   
VaR	(USD MM)	14.118		24.749    

Summary of analysis: (for UK Power only)

Following checks of  parameter and position inputs to the London VaR SS, and a VaR recalc (with appropriate  inputs from RT), the resultant VaR change does not seem to explain the discrepancies between RT and the SS VaR number.
Consideration of the term structure of the Net Open Positions in both RT and SS showed only minor differences.
Adhoc VaR calculation using SS positions run through RT . The VaR obtained was comparable to the SS VaR. 
Adhoc VaR run through RT with curve positions correctly mapped to the relevant price curves, rather than aggregated to PPP curve.

Analysis of inputs to the London Spreadsheet (SS) VaR model

PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ALL CHANGES WERE PERFORMED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS (i.e one change made and then returned to original state before changing another variable)

Correlations
Impact of RT correlations in SS : NEW VAR = USD 15.220 MM
(Energy Trend (ET) correlations mapped to PPPWD3, as RT does not contain ET correlation data. By keeping ET correlations the matrix became non positive definite, and hence unusable for VaR model). If the correlation matrix is larger (i.e. takes into account more markets) in RT as opposed to the SS this could also have a (marginal) effect (mainly because the Cholesky factorisation will be different). 


Factor loadings

FIVE VERSUS SEVEN FACTOR LOADINGS (SS uses 5 rather than 7 as per RT)

Houston Research (Jaesoo Lew) analysis has shown the effect of using five versus seven factor loadings. Considering one of the primary curves as an example  (PWD3). Five factor loadings describe 96.89 % of the movement of the curve whereas seven factors describe 98.53 %. Therefore the choice of whether to use 5 or 7 factors should not have a substantial impact on the VaR. 

 

Impact of RT factor loadings in SS : NEW VaR = USD 9.44 MM(ET (Energy Trends curve) with original factor loadings)
						   New VaR = USD  9.55 MM (ET factor loadings mapped to (PPP WD3))

Volatilities 
Impact of RT volatilities in SS : no change in VaR (vols are the same)

Prices 
Impact of RT prices in SS : no change in VaR (prices are the same with the impact of rounding errors providing very small immaterial differences)

Positions
Impact of RT positions in SS : no change in VaR

Forward forward volatilities 
Impact of utilising 'seasonality' flag (set to ON) in SS : NEW VaR = USD 14.650 MM
In RT these are assumed to be ON constantly, as are the fwd fwd volatilities (due to using implied rather than historic vol inputs)
Impact of utilising 'fwd fwd vol' flag (set to OFF) in SS : NEW VaR = USD 18.85 MM
The fwf fwd vol flag should be set to on in the SS model

Combining different parameters
The impact of RT correlations and RT factor loadings and several other combinations all gave changes to the VaR. However, the net result did not substantially differ from the results above (in blue).
 
Other issues:
Intramonth  positions -  not included in RT or  SS (for UKPower).  
Primary and secondary curve mappings. see below for Adhoc VaR results 
Currency conversion : Prices are in GBP. Does any term structure apply to GBP/USD FX (forward) curve used for transformation to USD VaR dollar Forward curve?

Therefore changing the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VaR between the two 'systems', but NOT completely. 

Checking differences in the term structure of positions

UK Power Portfolio is fed from three different sources; ET Elec positions are fed via a spreadsheet to the RT book ""UKPowerswap1"", The Eastern books are also fed via spreadsheet into RT books called ""E1SB1, E1SB3, E2XX1,E2XX3"". The UK Power book positions are uploaded directly from EnPower to the UK Power Portfolio in RT.
Differences:
ET ELEC : none
EnPower : total difference of (62.737) TWh (of which (63.700) is from June 01)
Eastern : total difference of (2,913,408) TWh (for the ' E1SB3' book only). Misfeed causing this error now corrected.

Ad-Hoc VaR Calculation Results

Run 1 :  Positions from the SS where ET Elec was mapped to WD3. VaR = USD 17.813 MM
Run 2 :  Positions from the SS where 1/12 of ET Elec positions were mapped to the 12 primary curves (PPP Wd and WE curves) 
VaR = USD 16.810 MM

The VaR results obtained from Runs 1 and 2 are comparable with the VaR number from the SS. The differences between these runs and the SS number can be attributed to parameter input variances (as described above)

Run 3 : Positions from SS split into component curves (i.e SG, N+P, NBP and PPP) rather than aggregated into PPP curves. ET Elec still split equally over the PPP positions. VaR USD = 25.432 MM.  This is almost exactly in line with the headline UKPower VaR calculated through RT.

UK Power exposure composition (TWh by curve price source)
PPP		(2.9)
NBP		9.5
N+P		(11.6)
SG		(32.6)
		_____
Total		(37.6)

Within the SS, all positions from above (i.e (37.6) TWh) were 'mapped' to the PPP curves, whereas in RT all curves were mapped individually as secondary curves (where PPP acts as primary curve) - even though PPP curve has smallest amount of price risk attached to it through having the smallest Net Open Position. The adhoc results support the assumption that  most of the RT VaR within the PPP_NEW book is due to SG and N+B rather than PPP.

The business may now want to consider the primary / secondary relationships used within RT for UKPower based upon the net exposures against each curve. Research suggests that SG should now become a primary curve based upon these results if price data is available for factor loading and correlation data analysis.. Further analysis on the impact of this change would be needed to quantify the effect of this.

As VaR (at the 95% confidence interval) should typically represent expected losses over 1 day for 1 day in a 20 day period, backtesting should demonstrate this by illustrating a realised PnL loss greater than the VaR number. However, for UK Power, the realised PnL losses have only exceeded the VaR approximately once over the last 300 days. By increasing the reported VaR number, this may not seem appropriate given the underlying reasoning behind VaR and empirical evidence from backtesting. It should be borne in mind that the current structure of the UK Power markets, since the introduction of NETA, has only been in operation for approximately 45 days. For this reason, all data considered for either correlation or factor loading analysis should be considered with care. 

The introduction of NETA into the UK Power market has necesserily created more risk to Enron, especially until the market settles down and gains maturity and stability. Therefore, the revised UK Power VaR of USD 25 MM is not entirely inappropriate, although still appears a high number in absolute terms. Research and Risk Management will investigate the underlying parameter levels during the next few days now that the core assumptions have been verified.

In many cases the same point was made by more than one person.  The similar comments helped me decide what was important, but I selected just one version to include in the writing.  You may notice that I have edited your statements to reflect past tense and otherwise to improve the flow of the overall text.  My intention is not to change the meaning of what you said.
Please look the quotes over and let me know if these words can be used as they are written as part of the writing or if you want to change anything.  In either case, please let me know by email or by phone ((713) 871-8345 before January 30th).   
I have assembled a great description about your group using your collective words.  As of now, the sections include:
Beginning Efforts 
Maintaining Effectiveness in Client Services 
Guiding Principles of the Operations 
Leadership 
Personal Characteristics and Interpersonal Dynamics 
Reflective Thoughts at the End
Once I have approval from each of the 20 people who provided quotes, I will send an edited draft to Vince for his comments.  After that, I'll send the document to you for your comments.  Then I will focus on publication, although in the end, I expect that the document will have to be further pared to have a chance of being published.  
I still believe that the experience of the Research Group was extraordinary in itself.  At the same time, the current publicity related to the larger Enron debacle may override the Research Group's story for a while.   In case you're wondering, I have not attempted to relate the Research Group story to current Enron issues in any way.    
Thank you for your involvement,
Ann Thomas

"RiskNews Update - 1/6/2001","============================================================
RiskNews Update - week ending 1/6/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
============================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

The top news of the week came as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision received widespread criticism from banks, trade associations and academics regarding its proposed implementation of Basel II, the new capital accord for internationally active banks.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association criticised the proposed introduction of rigid capital floors. The leading swaps trade body also criticised the internal ratings multiplier and controversial ""w"" charge on credit derivatives, and was supported by the US' Bond Markets Association (BMA). The BMA also said the proposals would increase regulatory capital costs, and impair liquidity in repo, securities lending and margin lending transactions. US investment bank Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, said it is concerned the accord could adversely affect banks that concentrate on trading activities rather than lending. Multilateral lending body, the IMF, called for the new proposals to be applied to all banks in all countries and not just internationally active institutions, while others raised grave concerns that the proposals would have a significant detrimental impact on loans to emerging markets.

RiskNews (www.risknews.net) has produced eight stories on the subject of Basel responses and will continue to investigate replies in the coming weeks.

"Re: The first document for audit","Vince:

I read the relibaility-based VAR method document with interest.

Here are some comments:

1. The document falls short of describing how
to use the method in practice, but rather
gives some general motivation. I am confident
that I myself could not develop an algorithm
based on this document, unless all of the
derivative valuation functions are explicit
(and rather nice) functions
with explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which case
the VAR problem is not so hard in any case,
as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case.
(My comment here is critical of exposition.
I do not suggest that the proposed method
is weak!)

2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Pan
addresses only normal returns is not
correct. The main point of our paper was to allow
for jumps, including fat tails and skewness.
The comment that we rely on delta-gamma
is a good criticism,and the main potential
advantage of the reliability approach,
if it works in practical cases.

3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines from
the bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))

4. There is a missing `we' on page 5, 9 lines
from the bottom.

5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) does
not mention what machine was used.

6. The example (page 8) does
not really have much non-normality. Skewness=0,
and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?)
are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosis
is an extra order of magnitude, with lots
of skewness.


Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot,
and left me wanting more clarity,
and a cookbook.


I hope `events' at Enron have not made things
difficult for you.

I will later bill you for one hour, if that is OK.


Warmest personal regards, Darrell

"FW: Subjective Inputs for Model development and  Data for Moody's RiskCalc","
Hi Mark,

	
  	This email is in reference to our meeting today regarding the following issues:
		1.  Meeting with Mark Braemer (??) to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models (to be released this summer).
		2.  Your willingness to let us use some of your data (in files on the 6th floor) to experiment with Moody's RiskCalc.

	In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process - especially the subjective component.  Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties.

	Also, thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the 6th floor.  We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down.

 
	More specifically, to evaluate Moody's RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enron's North American (private firm) counterparties:

		
 	
Fiscal Year
The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year's (1999) inflation level. In general this 'estimation error' will not cause any great problems, as size affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not). 

Cash & Equivalents
This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities. 

Inventory
Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, insurance costs, and storage costs.

Current Assets
This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, marketable securities, and other current assets. 

Total Assets
Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, and investments and advances). Leave previous year's total assets blank for Australian companies. 

Current Liabilities
Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. 


Total Liabilities
This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest). 


Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior year's retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

Sales
This item consists of the industry segment's gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers. 

Cost of Goods Sold
Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

EBIT
Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income. 

Interest Expense
This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities. 


Net Income
This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous year's net income blank for Australian companies. 



Extraordinary Items
Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous year's extraordinary items blank for Australian companies. 


Country
This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia. 





Thanks for your assistance,
Iris

"Headcount","Jim,

Current headcount of the group is 49, including assistants, associates and
analysts, and  part-time employees. The core group head count is 36 professionals.

I am attaching a spreadsheet that gives you  affiliation of each employee with the primary
unit he/she supports. Some people support multiple units but I ignore such details.

What is shown below are the percentage cost allocations to different Enron units.
The allocations are based on the averages from the last year and will apply to 2002.

"Compensation Concern","Sevil,
 
As I stated to you yesterday, I am extremely sorry for causing so much confusion over the non-existent compensation concern.  I would like to reassure you though that there are no problems or concerns, and that I was just letting my mind get ahead of me, and was mixing different thought processes and projects.  Unfortunately, you had to reap the repercussions of my brain malfunction.   I hope that you accept my apology, and can rest with an easy mind.

Attached I am sending you the instructions for installing PJM Profiler into your machine. Before you start following the instructions, you should create a new folder in which you'll need to put PERL then copy PJM Bid Profiler folder into that new folder. And don't forget to create a shortcut for PJMProfiler2.exe to run it from your desktop. PJM Bid Profiler is located at O:\Research\Sevil\PJM Bid Profiler. Then you can start doing the steps in the instructions. I hope that this works. If it does not, please let me know.

Gwyn,

As we discussed earlier, there are no firm due dates  set for  asset models mentioned in my curve request. I discussed the timeframe with Andre again and we agreed that our best estimate would be that we should have all models by end of this month.

Thanks again for working with us on a rather ""vague deadline""!

"REVISED REMINDER: Feb 1 Industry Collaborative on Developing     Energy Standards Organization in NYC","
Attached are the registration form and  agenda for Friday's February 1 industry meeting in New  York City. This meeting is a  continuation of Monday's Jan   28 industry collaborative at DOE to develop a ""single"" consensus standards  setting organization by March 15, as directed by FERC. Provided below is the  matrix developed by industry at Monday's meeting identifying  the areas of similarities and differences between the various models and  proposals. We look for you to review the matrix internally and be prepared to  advance the discussion and start making the hard decisions in New  York.
 
We strongly encourage all companies to participate in New York  and the subsequent industry meetings. FERC staff will present  in the morning and industry will begin discussions and negotiations thereafter.  FERC is holding its Northeast Energy Infrastructure Adequacy Conference on  Thursday, January 31 at the same Helmsley Park Lane Hotel.  It was a  concerted decision to hold this meeting in New York City to allow for  companies to maximize their trip North and participate in both meetings, if  desired. Please fax or e-mail the registration forms to jmastin @eei.org  or the fax number provided on the registration form. We have registered  close to 75 persons for this meeting and need an approximate count of attendees  to ensure adequate meeting space for all participants. If you do not forward the  form by COB Thursday, please contact us by phone and bring a completed  registration form to the meeting. 
 
Also, for those companies that can not attend in person, we  have established a conference call dial-in. 
 
The number is 800-860-2442. 
Call Name: Wholesale Standards Call  
Date/Time: Friday,  February1 from 8 AM-4PM

Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK under the

Dear Vince
 
I have not heard from you for a few days and was  wondering what is happening. The last time I spoke to Shelley, everything was  fine and that you were still going ahead with your presentation and  co-presenting the workshop on energy risk.
 
Please do reply to put my mind at  rest!
 
Thank you

Yes Vince is still planning on coming.  He probably will leave
Houston at 6:00 AM.  We have already rescheduled his project
review meeting from Thursday to tomorrow, so I know he still 
has it on his calendar.

Dear Shirley,

I thought it might not be a bad idea, in light of all the turmoil these 
days at Enron, to doublecheck one last time to make sure that Vince is 
still on for this Thursday and Friday.  I am planning on meeting him at at 
around 10 a.m. in my office on Thursday.

Thanks,
