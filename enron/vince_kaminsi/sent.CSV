Dear Colleague:

Eric W Cope has submitted an application to AT&T Labs,
with a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application.
We thank you in advance for providing this letter.  The reference letters are
a very important part of our evaluation process, but we also recognize that
they call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part.
In this message, we first describe below the three options for submittal
of the letter, and then, in the final paragraphs, you will find some
comments about the nature of the job applied for.

We know your time is precious, so we have tried to make the
process as efficient as possible.  If you have access to a browser
from your mailer, then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below:

  http://www.research.att.com/~kbl/cgi-bin/resumedocs/S05371/R966

Via this web page, you can submit text, html, postscript, or pdf files.
Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for
this particular student.  It is linked directly to the student's resume,
and the processing occurs automatically and immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying
to this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending
the letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and
not as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes
the entire subject line in your reply message.
If you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter
will occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.

Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless
you ask that it be treated as fixed-format.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please
note that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be
distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you
wish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html
for information on the proper address to use for various purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:

This student has applied for a summer internship.
We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate
work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,
depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in
a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the
ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function
somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization
with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you
may have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new
material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.


Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Ken Lyons,

Subject:	RE: Sparks Consulting

Vince,

my concerns exactly about revealing pricing approaches.  Sparks is primarily a fundamentals/data shop.  They do not do any statistical modeling at all, as far as I can tell from discussions until this point.  We have already used a lot of information from USDA, which seem to be more statistically sophisticated, at least in the research they sponsor.  The worry would be that Sparks would get more info out of us to use in their consulting activities than we would from them.  I would like to keep the discussions at an exploratory level, where we do not say exactly what we do, and we have them propose alternatives.

Also, I am taking the CFA Level 3 exam on Saturday, so travelling on Friday would be inconvenient for me.  Any later date is better for me, if possible.

"RE: Summer Associate","Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce

Subject:	Energy Committee Minutes from January 23rd

Energy Committee Members

The following members were in attendance at the January 23rd meeting: Bruce
Williamson, Tina Sivinski, Tim Tipton, Bruce Sukaly, Bob Peebler, Vince
Kaminski, Dean Arthur Warga, Praveen Kumar, and Lane Sloan.  The handout
material is attached for members that could not attend.

The committee viewed a TV ad  for the Bauer College and a TV news story on
the new AIM center and  Cougar Fund.  The first item of business was the
Partnership program.  The committee agreed on the following levels:

             Trustee            $100,000
             Partner                50,000
             Investor               25,000
             Sponsor              10, 000

For this year,  these levels would receive placements in the new Energy
Certificate Programs which will start in September of this year as follows:
Trustee up to 10, Partner up to 4, Investor up to 2, and Sponsor 0.   All
members of the partnership program would be able to participate in the
Learning Community programs of seminars, forums, and symposiums free of
charge with the number of attendees and special arrangements varying
depending upon the partnership level.  The Chairman noted that with the
certificate classes beginning in September, then the annual fee structure
would need to align accordingly which left a funding gap for the first part
of the year for the marketing costs to launch GEMI.  The original idea had
been for the one time entrance fee in the Partnership Program to cover these
costs but as you recall the committee did not favor that approach.  The
Chairman asked the committee to provide ideas on how to fund these marketing
efforts originally targeted at $200,000 for this year.

Dr. Kumar discussed three energy certificate programs to be available as 1)
Risk Management 2) International Project Finance, and 3) Energy Accounting.
The courses can be fully developed for the Risk Management and Energy
Accounting to start programs in September (many already available).  The
International Project Finance may require additional time because of
development efforts on certain courses.  Dr. Kumar requested that the members
identify people in their organizations that could give detailed feedback on
the course proposals so we are assured they fit the needs of the Energy
community.  We will also begin discussions with Energy committee members on
what level of participation your forsee for your company.  Dr. Kumar noted
that the BS and MS programs would be underway but less of an issue for course
development as students would not be taking these more energy focused courses
until junior and senior years.  He said that specialized training programs
seemed to be of high interest and more activity than originally anticipated.

The chairman covered the feedback on the seminars, forums and conferences.
There was real interest in seminars and forums but committee members did not
recommend pursuing conferences at this time.  The plan would be to have in
steady state 3 seminars per year which would be for large audiences with a
featured speaker.  It was noted that the venue would be an important
consideration to attract appropriate audiences.  Various suggestions were
given on topics of interest with an overall view that the presentations
should be practical and of high quality. The committee agreed that a
reasonable fee should be charged to non members of the partnership program.
The feedback on the forums was that they should be smaller more focused
groups with different formats depending upon the subject matter.  The thought
was that they could address overarching issues integrating energy and service
sector considerations. Non members would not participate but selected student
participation was seen as valuable.

A new concept of symposiums was introduced based on discussion with various
committee members.  The idea of a symposium was to bring together important
spokespeople and other key participants on a topic of high interest to the
Energy community. The Bauer College would provide a coordinating role to
address the issue with the objective of gaining input on all fronts.  Dr.
Kumar noted that there had been various discussion with members around
current topics emanating from the Enron collapse such as clearing house and
credit risk considerations.  The committee was quite enthused that an
imporant event could be created but it needed to be very carefully thought
out as to topic and the management of the process including the media.  It
was discussed that if the Bauer College wanted to sponsor such an event then
it would need to provide a project manager.  Committee member companies would
need to provide assistance/advice particularly on coordinating the media.
Dr. Kumar will be sending out an e-mail to get your input.  Then Dean Warga
would make a decision on whether to pursue such a significant event which
could be a great launch vehicle for GEMI but also carried a series of risks.

Next, Dr. Kumar discussed briefly the trading center noting that the key
issue was endowment funding before any significant activity could take place.
 The college was continuing to think through the content and integration with
other aspects of GEMI, the AIMs investment center, etc.

The Chairman then discussed GEMI's overall marketing image.  There was some
fine tuning of the proposal providing further clarity and emphasis of key
aspects of GEMI but in general a high consensus on the desired image
contained in the attachment.  After the dialogue on the symposium, which
would be a major marketing effort in an of itself, the discussion on external
and internal promotion was tabled til next meeting.  The chairman noted that
there would probably be a need for a two tier approach if the symposium
effort was pursued.  The major focus initially being on the symposium then
coupled with a growing effort on the overall GEMI marketing
over the next several months.

The last item was the competitive assessment/relationship with other
universites and organizations where the chairman discussed the current
approach and principles in the attachment.  This received good support from
the committee.

The committee members recommended the next meeting to occur in six weeks.  I
will send out a separate e-mail on possible dates for you to consider.

Best Regards,
Lane

My apologies for the delay in firming up the date of our trip.

Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in

Hi guys,

here is a simple template based on discussions with Vince and Rakesh.  It takes positions for a single commodity (physical and financial), collateral info, and calculates P&L and collateral needs over a one month horizon.

This can be expanded to add pictorial info, and other expenses, and any other details as needed.

This is just a first cut, please feel free to tear it apart as appropriate.

Vasant

"RE: Get Together This Coming Tuesday?","Dale,

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

The commercial groups are still interested and are moving 
towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the 
product. As I have  said, we are not the 
decision makers in this case. 

I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.

Subject:  Get Together This Coming Tuesday?


Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through
license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?
If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our
power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

Vince,
I am writing in regards to an energy derivatives training course I am
developing.  I would like to invite you to be an instructor for the course.
A preliminary agenda is attached.  Brett Humphreys from Risk Capital
Management is teaching on Day One, and I was wondering if you would be
interested in covering all or part of Day Two.  The topics outlined here can
be modified based on your feedback.

Our training courses are structured for an interactive, classroom-type
setting.  We limit the audience to 25 people and bring in 2-3 instructors to
cover the material over the course of two days.

I will follow up but please let me know what you think.

Subject:	ALLIANCE FERC ALERT: Status Report on Interconnection     Agreement and Procedures & Extension Request


Attached is the status report and motion for extension of time filed on  Friday, December 14 by the Generator Interconnection Coalition drafting  committee. This group is the smaller subset of the larger industry-wide plenary  group formed as a result of the FERC's directive to convene an Interconnection  conference to develop a consensus Interconnection Agreement and Procedures  document that all of industry would adopt. 
As the industry plenary  session yielded as much results as could be expected in a large group setting,  the drafting committees were formed of Generators, Transmission Owners,  Transmission Dependent Utilities, and ISO/RTOs. A committee was formed for both  the drafting of the Interconnection Agreement and Procedures documents. Many of  your companies are represented on one of these committees. 
Because the  FERC set a December 14 filing due date for a final consensus interconnection  document, we filed for an extension of time to complete the drafting process and  finalize the documents for FERC consideration. No one entity has endorsed the  document in its entirety, because drafting and negotiations are still underway.  Since the larger plenary had not had an opportunity to review the documents and  be provided a walk-through by the drafters, the request for an extension until  January 11, 2002 for which to file a final comprehensive consensus  Interconnection document was made. In addition, we filed for extension of the  ANOPR comments due date which was initially set for December 21, but has been  extended until January 25. This will allow for the larger plenary group to  reconvene the week of January 14 at FERC for a two-day session to discuss the  final workproduct. 
A notice designating the dates and times of this plenary  session will be provided at a later date. 
Anticipating our  filing of the status report and motion for extension, FERC granted both requests  for extensions to file. Attached are the status report, motions and notice  granting extension.

People associated with India projects (Sandeep, Krishna, etc) may benefit.  Of course, if you are sponsoring, I would like to be invited.

To:	Kaminski, Vince J
Subject:	Power VAR- comments on Winton's document

Vince,

1) I agree with paragraphs 1 and 2 in Winton's document (re-running jumps and clustering and correlations of jumps).

2) Regarding 3 (fixing instability in volatilities) I would suggest implementing volatilities smoothing (see short document attached)
 
3) Also: regarding correlations. The analysis I did was showing that correlations on fixed contracts prices are much more
consistent, have less noise versus prompt, promt+1, etc prices correlations (remember those pictures?). I was suggesting
to switch to those. IT implemented this in some version a while ago, but since they don't use version control environment properly
I am not sure they still have it. This will allow us to capture also the correlations across gas and power (I experimented with NG-R6 correlations) at least for 2 prompt years. 

4) We need to ask IT to increase the number of columns in the database table which holds factors from 7 to 100. Then we (Research)
can experiment with joint factor analysis to capture term-structure of correlations across curves.

"Re: PSERC Industrial Advisory Board Meeting Invitation","Dear Mr. Ray,

I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's
upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.   

Our  work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with PSERC at this moment. We would very much like to stay
in touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this year.

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*	a general energy risk related topic
*	a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*	your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

I realise that you don't have time for email or anything these days.   I just wanted to say that I'm very sorry to hear about everything that is going  on at Enron.  I hope that you are OK?  
 
I understand that Enron Europe is pretty much ending  business tomorrow, except for Enron Metals.  It's all very  shocking and unbelievable.  Just to let you know, and maybe it will benefit  someone, we will be looking to hire someone to head some things up for us in  London.

Vince, 
I've ended up interviewing 20 people in the Research Group; everyone was very cooperative and insightful.  Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned.
When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.
Thanks again for your interest and support.  I'll keep you informed of progress!

Research Team,
 
Thanks for taking the time yesterday to meet with Gilda and me so that we could begin to address the questions that you have regarding the merger between Enron and Dynegy.  Although I do not yet have any new information for you, yesterday I submitted the following list of questions to the Q&A team, and will hopefully receive an update from them either tomorrow or Friday.
 
1) If the SEC files lawsuits upon conclusion of the investigation, will that hold up or stop the merger?
2) What are Whalley's responsibilities going to be after the deal is closed?  I know that he is going to be the EVP, but what does that entail?
3) Did we offer some sort of guarantee that we will maintain our current intellectual capital talent base?
4) Will back office functions start merging before the deal closes?  If so, when will this happen?  Chuck Watson made reference to this in the analyst call yesterday morning.
5) For employees who started working this year, will they still be granted options as part of the all employee stock option program?
6) Will all previously granted options vest upon deal closure?  Is there a provision in the plan that stipulates option vesting upon a change of control? 
7) What is going to happen to the current Analysts and Associates?  Will we be reducing their headcount, decreasing recruiting efforts?1
8) What is the timeline for disposing of ""non-core"" businesses?
9) If you receive a reorganization severance package and opt to sign the waiver, are you precluded from joining the class action law suit?
10) What is going to happen to Enron's educational assistance program?  Currently some active employees are in school, and will we continue to pay for their education?  Also, there are some employees who are in school, but who have committed to return to Enron since we are paying for their education, or have stipulated that we will pay for their education upon return.  How is this program going to change?
 
Additionally, I have a meeting scheduled with Margaret Daffin tomorrow to discuss concerns regarding Visa's and Green card's.  I will send an email tomorrow with answers to the FAQ's.  
 
If any of you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me or just stop by my office.  It is such a privilege to be able to work with you and your extraordinary and fabulous team, and my door is open for each and every one of you.
 
Thanks,
Anne

Subject:	RE: Pricing of restriction on Enron stock

Vince,
I just spoke with Rakesh.  I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about.  There are actually two different sets of forwards: one for up to 18MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall, and the other was for 12MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares.  We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March, and I'm certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the 18MM shares.  In fact, I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology.  Of course, the valuations on the 12MM shares had no such component.  Let me know if you have more questions or concerns.  Thanks Vince.
Ron

Ron,

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the Enron's point of view.


Please, let us know if this is required.

Hi Vince.

We really feel that there could be enormous benefit to your presenting at the SMS conference.
So few people are actually using real options in practice and we feel that the topic is critical in these uncertain times.
I am very happy to cover the conference costs out of my Chair budget - that is what the Chair is for!

As of 8:00 am this morning, EWS had reached $1,204,056 in pledges, which is 94.36% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000 and our participation rate is 65.39%.  Needless to say, the campaign will continue for a few more days in order to reach 100% of the Enron goal.

If employees are having problems with the system, have them call or e-mail me with their pledge.  I can do it for them.  They will receive a confirmatory e-mail, which they can use to check for accuracy.

Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by business unit/functional group:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation
	EA			$202,713	68.06%
	EBS			$157,800	38.95%
	EEOS			$74,949		90.02%
	EEL			$36,846		65.22%
	EGM			$164,680	72.65%
	EIM			$93,372		79.58%
	ENW			$251,225	63.75%
	EWS Bus. Analysis	$39,723		99.08%
	EWS Bus. Dev.		$16,538		100.00%
	EWS HR		$20,009		76.06%

	EWS Research		$24,853		95.65%
	EWS Treasury		$17,981		100.00%

From a corporate perspective, EWS remains in 1st place in % of goal reached and is now in LAST place in participation rate.  Here are the other groups' totals:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation		% of Goal
	ETS			$291,399	89.87%			84.22%
	Corporate		$719,772	67.44%			91.69%
	EES			$424,616	67.70%			86.13%

 Les buveurs de vin plus intelligents que les amateurs de bi?re
Lundi 27 ao?t 2001
(LEMONDE.FR)


Le match entre tenants de la chope de bi?re et amoureux du verre de vin a-t-il trouv? son ?pilogue ? Apr?s les ?tudes attestant des effets b?n?fiques du ballon de rouge dans la pr?vention du cancer de l'intestin et celle, publi?e la semaine derni?re en Tch?coslovaquie, vantant les vertus des blondes contre les maladies cardiaques, le suspense ?tait ? son comble. L'?tude sur les m?rites compar?s des buveurs de chacune des boissons, publi?e le 14 ao?t au Danemark, est donc arriv?e ? point nomm?.


""Nous sommes les premiers au monde qui avons pu d?montrer clairement que les buveurs de vin sont plus intelligents et fonctionnent beaucoup mieux ? tous les ?gards que les amateurs de bi?re"", s'est f?licit? Erik Lykke Mortensen, chercheur en psychologie au centre danois des sciences ?pid?miologiques, dans les colonnes du B.T. le 14 ao?t. Le quotidien ? grand tirage, relay? par la tr?s s?rieuse revue Archives of International Medecine, d?taille la gen?se de l'?tude : diligent?e par l'universit? de Copenhague en collaboration avec le Kinsey Institute, aux Etats-Unis, elle partait de l'hypoth?se - ?mise par plusieurs ?tudes danoises r?centes - que les buveurs mod?r?s de vin sont en meilleure sant? que les personnes consommatrices d'autres boissons alcoolis?es.


Les chercheurs se sont pench?s sur 363 hommes et 303 femmes ?g?s de 29 ? 34 ans. Ils ont pass? au crible le statut socio-?conomique, le niveau d'?ducation, le quotient intellectuel, les sympt?mes psychiatriques, la personnalit? et le comportement en mati?re de sant?, notamment la consommation d'alcool, de chacun des cobayes. Lesquels ont ?t? divis?s en deux cat?gories, selon qu'ils buvaient de la bi?re ou du vin.


Il a ?t? observ? que boire du vin est associ? ? des QI, une ?ducation et un statut socio-?conomique ?lev?s. A l'inverse, les consommateurs de bi?re obtiennent des r?sultats bien moins probants. Qui plus est, le buveur de vin semble psychologiquement plus ?quilibr? que l'amateur de mousse.


Alors, est-ce le vin qui rend intelligent ou le fait d'?tre intelligent qui incite ? boire du vin ? Les scientifiques ont choisi le second terme de l'alternative. Ainsi, les effets apparemment b?n?fiques du vin r?sulteraient surtout d'une bonne ?ducation, notamment sur les questions de sant?, et de la mod?ration de ses consommateurs. Ces conclusions viennent conforter les Danois dans leur nouvelles habitudes. Traditionnellement grands adeptes de la bi?re, ils sont de plus en plus nombreux ? s'adonner au vin. Les ?tudes utiles font les peuples intelligents.

   Dear Vince

   Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently
   inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia,
   which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had an
   opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the
   programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as
   possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.

   I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852

   Kind regards.

Dear Vince:

	I have now spent 16 hours on the valuation project and wanted to touch
base with you to make sure that the basic approach makes sense and that you
think we are making an appropriate amount of progress.  My invoice is
attached.

	By the way, John Martin just mentioned that you have agreed to be our

help on this and would like to schedule some time next week to talk about
it in more detail.

	I look forward to hearing from you.

Natural Gas Futures Steady Again 
    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX settled nearly flat Friday for the second consecutive day with traders hesitant to take on new positions ahead of the weekend. Trade and commercial activity was almost non-existent and much of the activity was confined to low risk spread trading. Bearish sentiment was offset by short covering ahead of the weekend, although most traders say the downtrend is still intact in the absence of any significant weather change or hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. The July contract traded in a $0.06 range, ending up $0.005 at $3.742 per MMBtu. August gained $0.008 to $3.802 per MMBtu. The market was expected to dip to the $3.670 mark, but could not slide past $3.720, leading to some short-covering. The market remains under pressure from mild weather and a series of larger-than-normal storage injections that have filled storage to 49% of capacity. Texas should return to very warm conditions this week. In addition, the Northeast and Midwest are expected to see a rise in temperatures early this week that will create stronger demand. At test of support at the May 30th low of $3.67 is likely this week. The next level of support after $3.670 is seen at $3.570 and then $3.50. Resistance was pegged at $3.98 and then again at $4.14. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally mixed to down $0.05 Friday, except out west where spot prices continued to tumble. The Southern California delivery point of Topock fell about $2.50 per MMBtu, while Kern River and Opal dipped well below $2.00 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next delivery at the Henry Hub slipped $0.01 to $3.68 per MMBtu.

California Power Bonds Delayed Again
    California's plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in bonds to pay for power will be delayed until at least October. The delay is another a series of setbacks since the state first pushed back the initial offering date for the debt, originally planned for May. Proceeds from the sale, of what will be the largest municipal bond in US history, will fund future energy purchases and repay the treasury drained of billions of dollars from previous power purchases. Also, further delays are possible if a number of factors do not fall into place by mid-July. Including a failure of the California PUC to suspend its 'retail choice program' or to extend a $0.03 rate increase on SDG&E customers. Both of these revenue sources are needed to pay off the bonds. Still, California has secured an additional $1 billion on top of the $3.5 billion bridge loan secured earlier this week to help see the state through until officials can bring the bonds too market. The bond sale is expected to include $10 billion in tax-exempt debt, of which $6 billion will be fixed rate and $4 billion will be variable rate. It will include an additional $3.4 billion in taxable bonds that will also be priced at both fixed and variable rates. The huge amount of tax-free bonds will boost supply of California debt, forcing the state to offer higher yields to attract investors.

CMS Joins Enron with India Problems 
    CMS Energy's LNG-based power project at Ennore in southern India is now completely stalled because of the need for a credit support mechanism from the Indian government. CMS's problems come against a backdrop of a bitter payment battle between Enron's Dabhol Power and the state-run utility in India's Maharashtra state. CMS, along with India's Grasim Industries, leads a consortium to build a $1.6-billion LNG terminal and 1,850 MW power plant at Ennore port, just north of Madras. In January, India's finance ministry indicated it may scrap a plan to extend sovereign guarantees to 3 huge 
power projects, including the Ennore LNG project. The  Ennore project has been promoted by the Dakshin Bharat Energy consortium which also includes Germany's Siemens, Australia's Woodside and Unocal. The CMS-led consortium won the LNG project from the Tamil Nadu state government in 1998 and plans to build a 2.5-million tonnes a year LNG import, storage and regasification terminal. The LNG is to be imported from Qatar's RasGas and the electricity from the power plant will be sold to the federal government-owned Power Trading Corp of India.

Islander East Plans Pipeline from Connecticut to Long Island
    Islander East Pipeline has filed an application with the FERC to construct, own and operate 50 miles of interstate pipeline that will transport natural gas to growing markets in Connecticut, New York City and Long Island.  Islander East is an equally owned, limited liability company formed by Duke and Key Span. Islander East is expected to be in service in 2003, and will transport additional volumes to meet the energy needs of this region. Through interconnections to virtually every major supply basin in North America, including recently developed natural gas reserves in eastern Canada, Islander East will further supplement the natural gas supplies necessary to fuel new natural gas fired generating plants as well as local distribution companies in the area. The proposed 24-inch Islander East mainline will extend from Connecticut across Long Island Sound to Wading River, NY, with connections to KeySpan's Long Island delivery system. Also, Algonquin Gas Transmission Company is proposing certain upgrades to its system in Connecticut, that will interconnect with Islander East.

FERC ALJ Says California Power Refunds Likely
    The FERC administrative law judge, who is overseeing refund settlement talks in California's power market, says that generators that sold electricity in the state will probably have to pay back overcharges of several billion dollars. However, one would have to be paid in the first place before anyone could repay anything. The ALJ says California's claim the state is owed $9 billion is too high. Enron, Mirant, Duke, Williams, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy are among the producers that FERC could compel to make the refunds. The companies have said they did nothing wrong. The California PUC and the utilities will join in the negotiations at FERC headquarters in Washington. If no agreement is reached, the ALJ will have 7 days to make a recommendation to the 5 FERC commissioners on the refund issue.

California Senate Hears Allegations Against Duke
     Three former Southern California power plant employees gave testimony on Friday to a state Senate committee investigating alleged price manipulation. Allegations against Duke Energy, as the plant's operator, included throwing out spare parts to prolong the time a unit was out of service and ramping electricity output up and down to manipulate power prices. Duke denied the latest allegations by former workers at its South Bay power plant, saying it finds the charges disturbing and incredible. Duke says the time has come for it to take a stand against this daily barrage of misinformation. California has for months been accusing the Duke and other generators who purchased many of the state's power plants of taking advantage of a chronic shortage of electricity and price gouging. The governor is demanding $9 billion in refunds, and numerous lawsuits have been filed. The rhetoric has escalated into branding  the generators as pirates and even murderers and rapists of the California economy, most of which is a smokescreen to hide their true agenda, the forced donation of power to the state.  When Duke took over the Southern California plant they kept on all of its employees for 2 years under an operating agreement. Once that agreement expired, Duke hired about 80% of the staff. The 3 that testified were among those not offered jobs.

Subject:	No deal - Time to move !

All, 

After very serious consideration and having the experience of the first quarter,  I have decided the following:

1) Personally, I am starting the building of the public model beginning of June. I will follow a different methodological approach than the rest of the team but we are going to have the same common target for the 15th of July deadline.

2) The first suite of models will be ready beginning of July.

3) During implementation, I will be reporting to Scott Salmon and I am prepared to accept feedback on modelling (technical issues) from the following people (strictly): Iris Mack, Steve Leppard, Jagjit Dhaliwal, Slava Danilov, Vasant Shanbhogue, Bryan Seyfried, Amitava Dhar, Vince J Kaminski (The order of the names is random).  

4) Scott Salmon will communicate with the traders to make sure that we meet their requirements.

5) The traders should have all the time they need to assess the performance of the models and provide their valuable feedback. 

6) Extension of the models will be a continuous process (More data, more models).

7) Personally, I consider it absolutely beneficial  if I work closely with Houston and London Research from now on, so we can make sure that we do not miss anything going forward. If necessary, I am prepared to come to Houston and discuss technical issues about models.

8) If I have any problems to proceed with the current plan, I am going to ask for rotation as soon as possible. If this is not possible, I am going to leave the company immediately.
 
9) For those who invited me in the past in private rooms and asked me to slow down, I have to tell them that if this happens again I am going to proceed with an official complaint.

I am really sorry if I am being a bit agressive here, but I am sure that this the last chance for many of us. 

That's for now -

Best Regards,

g.

Subject:	RE: Models and Data from the Loan Pricing Corporation (A Reuters Company)



Hi,

	Today I met with John Dowling - a Vice President  of the Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC) .  LPC may present another potential set of options for ECT's data and/or public and private firm models needs.

	More specifically, John stated that LPC offers the following products/services:
	
?	A US data base - archives date back to 1988.  This database has various fields describing default and nondefault loans, etc.
?	A public and private firm model (both) for an annual subscription rate of $75,000.  These models estimate PDs for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.
?	The firm is beginning to collect data in European countries.


	John will be sending us further details about the analytical techniques used to develop their public and private firm models.  In addition, he will send us information on the various fields used in their database.



Regards,
Iris

Subject:	ENRON: DRI-WEFA Agriculture Commodity Submission

Dear Jennifer,

It was a pleasure to meet with you last week.  As part of our follow-up I
have prepared a preliminary proposal outlining DRI.WEFA's ability to provide
agriculture and fertilizer commodity data as well as freight rate
information (truck, rail and barge) in support of your fundamental analysis
at ENRON.

As I mentioned, Kemm Farney and I also met with Jeff Andrews.  We have
already forwarded on to him our Coal Monthly service, which is part of
ENRON's current services package.  We have also forwarded our forecast of
the current RCAF for coal, taken from our US Energy service (also a part of
your current package).

As discussed, the plan for follow-up is to have you and your colleagues
review this submission.  With your feedback, we will then present these
capabilities in a more detailed format that will include additional service
options.  Our current plan is to return to Houston in mid-June for this
purpose.

I have attached an Agriculture and Fertilizer Commodity Spreadsheet that
details the commodity type, forecast frequency, domestic and/or
international coverage.  I have also mapped the commodity price forecast
capability to the actual DRI.WEFA publication so that you can sample the
output.  All content is delivered electronically.  Telephone access is
always included.  Onsite presentations are available and customized white
paper reports can also be included.  Further consultative work tailored your
specific requirements can be included. Fees for these services, depending on
amount and frequency as well as customization, if any will likely fall in
the range of $10,000 to $30,000 annual. With your feedback we can better
tailor a package and establish fees.

Please review the attached spreadsheet and the accompanying attachments to
this email reviewing the DRI-WEFA Agriculture Services as well as a recent
PPT presentation. The spreadsheet refers to attachments and these will be
forwarded to you under a separate email from the head of the Agriculture
Services, Dr. Harry Baumes.

I look forward to discussing this submission with you and I'll plan to
follow-up next week to hear your comments.  Perhaps we can schedule our
presentation in Houston at that time.

As you can imagine, with the merger between WEFA and DRI many service issues
need to be finalized. We remain committed, however, to serving your
interests in a timely and professional manner.  We will therefore,
independent of this submission, review your combined WEFA/DRI services to
ensure we have the most efficient and appropriate set of services in place.
I have attached the press release announcing the merger for your review.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this ""extra"" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

Vince:

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,

I've talked several times with Scott Gerson of the Focus Group about the list of candidates he has presented to you.  He says that Sriram is ""ready to go"", but that the other NY guys are ""kinda iffy"".  He did say that they may become more interested in Houston if they don't receive NY job offers within the next week or so. We have scheduled Sriram to come in to interview with the group on Thursday, 4/19, beginning at 9:00 am with you, Vince.   I will keep you posted if I hear anything more from Scott.

Spoke with Jinbaek Kim today, and he is very excited about the offer to do a summer internship with the Research Group.  We will get his offer letter out to him tomorrow, but he has indicated a definite verbal acceptance.

Vince,

Regarding everything we talked today in all research meeting I was wondering how all these things are going to affect my situation. As we talked couple months ago I was trying to get ready to be employed full time in the new year. So in this case what do you recommend me to do? Shall we stick to what we talked before or shall we wait and see what time is going to bring? It'd be really nice if you could give some kind of direction.

Hi folks,

Here is the original version of the joke I tried to make at yesterday meeting.

I've never been much of a Handy Man. I decided to order the new Time
Life series of Do-It-Yourself books. The first book was titled, ""How to Fix
the Garbage Disposal."" Though I followed all the instructions to the best of
my ability, and spent many long hours, I never did get the darn thing
repaired. Fortunately, the next book in the series was titled, ""How to eat
with a HOOK!!!!""

Let's have a good day!

Jaesoo

Maureen:  I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Shirley did send me a hard copy of his resume, and I have been trying to reach him.  However, he has recently finished school and moved, so neither his email (at Johns Hopkins) nor his home phone number were correct.  I finally reached an old roommate last night who gave me Dan's cell phone number.  I left a message, and he emailed me late this afternoon with his new address and phone number.  I'll give him a call tomorrow, see what his availability is for interviews, and get back with you with the information.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Messaging Administration  
Sent:	Monday, July 16, 2001 6:38 PM
Subject:	Announcing Outlook Web Access for Houston Outlook Users

Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

Resolution Center at x31411 or

Dear Mr. Vincent Kaminski

Please consider my application for a suitable position in Quantitative
Analysis, Trading or Risk Management. You will find that my profile,
knowledge of investment products and derivatives, and experience in
investment banking and securities meets your requirements.

I bring together a combination of financial and energy experience. I have
knowledge of all financial products and the acumen to apply quantitative
techniques and tools to various valuation methodologies. Additionally, I
have experience and exposure at all stages of investments: seed stage,
venture capital, private equity, and secondary markets. My interest in
energy is manifest in studying and applying valuation methodologies to fuel
cell companies. You can expect my very proactive involvement in your
organization, a trait I cultivated working for and with startup companies.

I am graduating in Computational Finance and Financial Engineering from
Carnegie Mellon University and Nanyang Technological University. This course
is an intensive course in derivatives, risk management, financial modeling
using Visual C++, Java and Matlab, financial maths, etc. My research
interests include risk management, real options valuation, energy trading &
derivatives, and structured products.

I believe that with my background, knowledge, skills and experience I will
do my best to meet the challenges and responsibilities of a demanding
assignment. I am available to join from August 1, 2001. The company will
have to sponsor my employment visa in the US. I have no location preferences
and am willing to travel.

I look forward to hearing from you. You can reach me on 1+412-681-0152 till
June 28th and by email thereafter. Thank you for your consideration.

Vince, I finally joined a team that only had two members.  It looks like our
paper will only be about 13 to 15 pages.  We were wondering that since our
team is less than half the size of some of the other teams, if you could
possible relax the length requirement?

Thanks,

Jim,

Thanks for the feed-back. To assist in the further development of the
product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved
? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main
concern was whether or not CHARM would have the capacity to cover the very
different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would
you mind if someone from our CHARM group called you or Mr. Kaminski for
some specific comments ?

Regards,

Bertil

Bertil, I again wish to thank you for the presentation on the CHARM
product.  The response from the group is that the model requires more work
before Enron could consider it as a commercial product.  Please keep me
advised as I assume that you will continue to develop the model.

Michael,

We would be happy to put them on our mailing list of the GMM and send them the final electronic version of the presentation with the scenarios.  Due to the critical nature of Argentina we are monitoring it on a weekly basis in the GMM.  Do you think it would be useful to provide regional updates on some regular basis, eg.on a quarterly basis or more frequently for Argentina.

We will be handing this draft out today. 

We met with Goldman and Citibank yesterday and have reviewed the regions macro econ status. 

We need to get you more active in our activity. I do not think everyone knows your team exists. Put John Lavoratto, louise kitchens and Jim Hughes, stan horton  on you e mail list at least. I would reccomend you set a meeting up with them directly to let them know what your team is doing. I will talk to them again today. 

I am in Houston next week. I will stop by.

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @Energy2.1. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email.    Please see below for more information
regarding this new release..

FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of @ENERGY/ErgLib. The
accompanying documentation contains installation and other information.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been
implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and
Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT,
OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all
models.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.6.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.
If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of possible
backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo,
Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional
details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.5.

@ENERGY (Basics)
European options  and strips of European options now support valuation via a
jump diffusion model (see OPT and STRIPOPT functions). Average price options
(see the APO, SPREADAPO, CRACKAPO functions), and average strike options
(see the ASO, SPREADASO functions) now allow for a direct input of the
fixing dates.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
 Includes two new functions, OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation
of complex compound options.

If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of backward
compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and
Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.4.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
	@ENERGY (Forward Curve) is the new module which includes functions designed
to generate forward curves, volatility curves and mean reversion rates used
in many other @ENERGY functions. Module in beta release.

@ENERGY (Basics)
	APO's and ASO's: bug fixed when avg_starts < opt_expiry, and num_fixings=1.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
	No change.

@ENERGY (Weather)
	Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided.

@ENERGY (Swing)
	Pay_at_end with strips: previously implemented was pay at end of  all
periods. Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod. . Module still in
beta release.

	Bug fixes:
1)	if max_const=min_const and max_const in not a multiple of the maximum
daily amount (in previous version min_const was disregarded in this case).
2)	in strip with global constraints: if allowed number of swings per period
changes (currently this can only be due to calendar effects).
3)	strip at index: index was incorrectly evaluated after first sub_period.

New Excel Templates
	The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added:

powercalib.xls	examples of generating @ENERGY parameters for power.

Add-in Manager
Now supports function help. If template is open with the Add-in manager and
function help is requested through the manager, the relevant portion of the
documentation get displayed.

appreciated. Any comments or suggestions may be sent to support@fea.com

Importance:	High

Hi all!

First,  the lunch this week is about Enron's partici[pation in the Wharton e Business Initiative (WeBI)--we joined this past year and are engaged in a four year committment ($250,000/yr)  The attendees from Wharton are Prof Raffi Amit, WeBI Director and Professor of  Entrepeneurship;  and Lee Goldring, another WeBI Director. The purpose of the meeting is for a formal presentation about WeBI to engage appropriate Enron business units in the benefits of our more active participation as WeBI members.  I'm not aware that Tom will be here--I believe he was here Monday (I was travelling) ; He told me he'd be in Austin Tuesday and then back to Philly.

As to the Business Plan Competition--please check with Paul LeBeau in A/A recruiting.  It's true that Enron did participate last year.  I reviewed business plans and participated as a judge, along with Barbara Page from (then) Enron Investment Partners. Paul LeBeau and I have discussed the experience and my cost/benefit analysis of the experience with regard to Enron.  He and his group will decide whether to invest in this for 2002.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

Thanks!

--Christie.

Valuing dot-coms after the fall
The Internet roller coaster may rank as the market's most dramatic
upheaval over the past 20 years, but it certainly hasn't been the only
one. Remember biotech? Real estate? Leveraged buyouts? What about Japan
Incorporated? Sooner or later, investment values always revert to a
fundamental level based on cash flows. Get used to it.

Mobile portals mobilize for scale
As investors have cooled to new ventures, survival is now at the top of
the agenda for mobile portals. Whether a portal stays alive will depend on
its ability to offer accessibility, awareness, and the right services. The
rest of the struggle---rapid expansion to ensure long-term survival and,
eventually, global dominion---will come down to guts and determination.

The innovative organization
The idea that new businesses prosper best when separated from their
corporate parents has now become conventional wisdom. Although new
ventures do need space to develop, strict separation can prevent them from
obtaining invaluable resources and rob their parents of the vitality they
can generate. The solution? A balance of partitioning and integration.

Programmers abroad: A primer on offshore software development
More and more companies are going offshore to develop and maintain their
software. The reason is simple: this approach saves time and money.
Without discipline in managing offshore relationships, however, a company
not only can squander the cost and time savings it had hoped to gain but
also may face late deliveries, escalating costs, mismatches between
expectations and deliverables, and even outright failure.

Shirley,

I shall be in the office tomorrow after 12.
I am going to the UofH lecture at the Bauer Business School.

Please, take a look at this message. It outlines the process we
have to follow.

Vince,

As you meet with employees one-on-one tomorrow, you will want to cover a few items with them.  These are some things we determined through reductions in other groups that work fairly well:

have Shirley or your team admin prepared to receive all returned equipment (laptops, cell phones, pagers, blackberrys, American Express cards, long distance calling cards, etc.)
have someone call Cingular to confirm that Enron accounts can be converted to personal accounts.  I believe there is a form that the employee would need to submit to Cingular prior to the termination date.
Shirley should coordinate with each employee to verify that all pre-petition expenses have been paid and that all post-petition expenses have been submitted for reimbursement.
Because you have some lead time, you might consider instructing employees on how they should leave their desk.  It is very helpful if employees can destroy old documents, return supplies to a central location and leave the desk clean.
In the past we have realized after an employee leaves that we may not have the right contact information when needing to get in touch with them.  Attached is a template to have your employees update their personal information to ensure that any corespondance is appropriately sent.
 

Khymberly and I will both be in your meeting tomorrow at 3pm.

Thanks,
Shanna

Vince-

Are you guys still working on that ""project"" to provide content via EOL?
The reason I'm asking is we have developed a particular technology to
deliver fundamentals data via web-based applets, and we could probably
talk to the vendor about a larger license to permit its dissemination
this way. There would have to be disclaimers, and it might not work
because of the liability, but I did want to let you know we have a neat
technology to permit people to visualize data. Let me know if you want
to talk about it.

Thanks. This is my itinerary.

The flight arrives relatively early. Can we schedule
an early dinner (let's say 5:30 or 6:00 p.m)?

Vince,

Thanks for the title and outline of your seminar.  I understand that
you must be pretty tied up at this time.  As for your visit, I will
pick you up at the Atlanta airport.  I will meet you at the exit of
the escalator.  Please remind me of you airline and flight number.  I'll
have my cellphone with me (678-637-8303).  One of my colleagues and I will
take you to dinner in the evening.  Your schedule on Thurs. is as follows.

I'll pick you up at the hotel around 9:30.  We will have an informal
meeting with one of my students from 9:50 to 10:50.  She will present
to you some ideas that we have been looking at on bandwidth trading.  We
are expecting to get some comments and feedbacks from you.  Your seminar
will be from 11am to 12noon.  Dr. Bob Kertz (our QCF program
director) will take you to lunch after the talk.  After the lunch, I
arrange you to meet with our students from 2pm to 3pm.  The time slot 3pm
to 4pm is open.  We will arrange a cab to get you at around 4pm.

I look forward to your visit.

Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?

I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

I find the proposal OK.  I think it's premature to get into the support of
conferences and would therefore propose not to include them in the value
proposition at this time.

Although I liked the idea of the levels being tied to energy, I don't like
the titles.  I would like to see some additional options.  I will also put
some thinking into alternatives.

Included is a draft of a proposed fee structure arrangement for the
""partnership membership"" in GEMI.  Rather than focusing on discounts and
credits for the certificate fees, we thought the simpler concept would be to

have a certain number of slots provided at no charge for the different
membership levels. We have tried to allow maximum participation in the
seminars and forums but providing a pro-rationing mechanism if needed.   On
conferences, we have suggested discounts which grow in size depending on the

membership level. It would be helpful if you could respond by Dec. 15th if
you like the proposal or have any suggestions.Thanks for taking the time to
review.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Paolo Cadoni and I work for Risk Magazine in London.  I am
contacting you to request your assistance. We have recently had a very
interesting paper submitted for publication, entitled: ""Let's Swing Again
(Pricing Non-Storable Commodity Options)"".  I would very much like you to
act as an anonymous referee for this submission, if it is not too much
trouble.


Keypoints:
An expectation model with permanent and temporary shocks has been developed
and used to price a swing option (capacity reservation option) on a
non-storable commodity. The model is a hybrid of a permanent shock (binomial
tree) and temporary shock model (reminiscent of Black (1976)). The
flexibility offered by the model's hybrid nature allows it to capture the
empirical behaviour of electricity and gas prices: transient spot price
shocks and calibration  to the futures prices and the futures volatility
term structure.  As the size of the volatility of the temporary shocks is
increased the component of the swing option priced derived from the
temporary shocks quickly dominates the component from the binomial model.
Therefore, a failure to model the transient shocks when pricing swing
options may present a serious modelling error.

I do hope that you are able to help us out. If you are in agreement, I can
email you the paper immediately - we would need the report emailed to us
within around four weeks. Please get in touch as soon as possible.


Many thanks for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Paolo Cadoni

Subject:	Re: Hello

Vince, thanks for your update. I am sorry hear that the people in your group
will be affected as well.

Please keep me in the loop as you get time to work on your future
activities.

One of the areas where I would like to creat a new business line is in
Enterprise Cash flow analysis.

It will be a software (middleware) play that will link up with existing
financial tools to assess and manage cash delta to various exposures
(commodity price, volume, weather, interest rate & spread, FX, etc...).
There are plenty of tools out there claiming to do this but I don't think
they have the risk management and financial analysis background to build an
effective tool. Also, without consulting support going along with it the
client would not be able to assess the exposure.  It can provide reliability
analysis type of drill down from what can go wrong to simulation of down
grade events, etc...

The tool could be used to host a site where publically traded company's
financial information can be extracted out of EDGAR and Cash flow risk
indicator can be publihsed....

I am thinking that there must be a grant (matching based on a company
seeding this activity) that could be used to do the initial development. It
could come from SEC, AIMR, FAS, etc...  I know there are plenty of cash flow
at risk (CAR) and profit at risk (PAR) tools out there but I think I can
take that old concept and deliver the product that is useful and provides
relevant information.  The presentation of the software is as important as
its functionality.  Quicken came up with its product, which was not that new
but it worked and easy to use.....

The resources I am talking about is myself and a software programer to start
with and adding another junior analyst later.



Let me know if I am missing something here.

I don't know what your plans are going foreward, but I would like to keep the communication open. I've been playing around with a few concepts for special sections in the Risk Desk -- tossed around the ideas to a few big fivers, CRO's and the like, guys like Pokalsky and so on. The publication is growing pretty steadily so I think some kind of relationship between the two of us might be good for all involved.

name is Dr. Steven R. Hetzler.  Email is hetzler@almaden.ibm.com.  Phone is
408-927-2614.  I mentioned your son's areas of expertise, and he was
interested in receiving a copy of his resume if your son might be
interested. As I mentioned, Steve's area of interest is storage technology.
Feel free to contact him and mention my name.  He said that IBM put on a
hiring freeze three weeks ago, so it may be a couple of months until he can
hire.  But, he has openings for the right people when he gets authority.
Bill

Good morning Vince,

NEM needs to close above 17.20 to show upside potential. A stronger mining play looks like AU.

I want to thank you for going to bat for me as much as I hear that you did.  Enron was a company where my skills could be very beneficially used. I regret that we didn't get to scratch the surface of what I could contribute. I feel that beyond being business associates, you and I became good friends. I hope that can remain constant through out the future. 

The one true question that I would like to pose to you is this. It appears that the political arena here at Enron is currently unfavorable for technical analysis. Without fear of hurting my feeling one way or the other, should I consider having future opportunities with Enron once, if and when, the management situation becomes different?

If nothing ever meshs, that does do stop you from contacting me whenever you need Candlestick/technical evaluations.

Your good friend,


Steve

Hi Vince,

I hope all is well with you!

As for my coordinates.....I am trading (position trading--
futures)....primarily soybeans, 30-year bonds, swiss franc,
and British Pound......I observe the charts after the markets close...put in
my orders accordingly .....and sit and wait for
confirmation and/or for stop orders to be elected....:)...I continue
watching the gold charts.....eventually, that market will
wake up again!   Vince, I am curious of your fundamental analysis of the
currency, and/or equity markets...

Since most of my chart analysis is performed after the markets close....I
have extra time to explore other business opportunities.....at this time, I
am working on a initiative, to import nurses from India to the U.S.!  A
friend of mine, from New Delhi, has asked that I work with her on this
project.  She is talking w/Duke University, as well as the University of
North Carolina Nursing School to collaborate w/her, in India, and provide
their curriculum in India....We are talking to hospitals throughout the
U.S., and are finding an interest in Indian recruits.  Of the foreign nurses
now entering the U.S., the majority are Filipinos.  Did you know about the
shortage of nurses here in the U.S.?

Hello to Mike.....and also....How is Maureen?

Keep in touch......Anytime, you stop in Chicago, call me...312-643-1910....I
live very close to the Enron office on Michigan Avenue..

Take care,

Vince, I enjoyed our conversation this afternoon.

I came back to my desk to read this story in the clips -- it says the Frontline show is airing tonight.

I'll dig up TVA for you,
Jeannie



June 5, 2001, 1:17AM Houston Chronicle PBS pledge drive alters schedule  By MIKE McDANIEL  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle TV Editor  Paul Hope, like many theater fans, tuned to Channel 8 Sunday night in anticipation of the first hour of the joint PBS/CBS telecast of the 55th Annual Tony Awards.  What he got instead was a travelog hosted by Rudy Maxa. Because this is pledge drive week, Channel 8 did not air the first hour of the three-hour award show, as it has in previous years.  ""Channel 8 has made Houston a theatrical cowtown by this decision,"" Hope, a resident actor at the Alley, said Monday.  Alley artistic director Gregory Boyd called the preempting ""absolutely indefensible and shocking.""  Fortunately, Channel 8 is being more flexible about a second program that it had originally decided not to air this week.  Frontline, which airs nationally at 9 p.m. tonight, takes a hard look at California's energy problems and their direct connection to Houston. The telecast includes interviews with several Houston players, including Enron's Kenneth Lay.  KUHT station manager John Hesse said Channel 8 became aware of the Frontline story, titled Blackout, and its Houston connection last week. Because of its local news value, the show will be tape-delayed and aired on KUHT at 10 tonight. It will be repeated at 9 p.m. June 12, when Channel 8 originally had planned to air the show.  ""When we learned of the local significance, we obviously wanted that program to air (here) in a timely manner as in the rest of the country,"" Hesse said.  ""We are getting a little bit of heat for the Tony thing,"" Hesse said. ""The problem is, it's right in the beginning of our pledge evening. We had a schedule in place, and a decision was made to stick to that schedule because that was our opportunity for fund raising.""  Fund drives are vital to keep the station operating and to purchase quality programming.  ""When we're scheduling our pledge dates, we try to coordinate the normal PBS schedule with what we determine will do the best for us in terms of fund raising,"" Hesse said. ""We only use about 2 percent of our air time a year in fund-raising efforts, and when we're using that 2 percent, we have to make the most of them.""  That's no comfort to the folks who were hoping to experience what turned out to be theatrical history being made. Mel Brooks' The Producers -- not only the talk of Broadway but also the entertainment world -- won a record 12 Tonys Sunday night.  Most were awarded in the show's first hour -- where Tonys for director, choreographer and other categories are handed out. To diehards, the PBS portion of the Tonys exceeds CBS' in that it airs without commercials and includes behind-the-scenes interviews with directors, composers, designers and others.  Hesse explained that Channel 8's pledge-drive dates were set before the station knew whether PBS would even have the Tonys.  The first hour of Sunday's show had direct links to theater talents whose work has been seen and heralded in Houston.  David Woolard, nominated for best costume design for The Rocky Horror Show, is costume designer of The Carpetbagger's Children, which opens Wednesday at the Alley.  Doug Besterman, a winner Sunday for his orchestrations for The Producers, has done the same for the Frank (Jekyll and Hyde) Wildhorn productions that have played here.  Doug Schmidt, a nominee in the scenic design category for 42nd Street, was a designer for the Alley's Civil War and A Christmas Carol.  Hesse said, ""We knew by the end of March"" that PBS would co-host Sunday's show, and yet ""the decision was made to stick with the schedule in place.""  Because the Tonys isn't ""owned"" by PBS, it could not be used as a pledge show, although Hesse conceded pledges could have been sought before and after.  ""There's nothing against the `rules,' "" he said. ""It's just been our normal method of operation here (to run the pledge drive at 7 p.m.) in terms of our prime-time evening pledge start.""  In a related development, NBC affiliate KPRC will not be showing the first episode of a new comedy series bowing tonight. Kristin, starring Kristin Chenoweth, is being pre-empted by Road to Redemption, a movie funded by the Billy Graham Crusade.  Channel 2 made a decision in March to run the movie 7-8:30 tonight, KPRC general manager Steve Wasserman said. NBC has scheduled the premiere of Kristin for 7:30 p.m. and is not allowing it to air later in prime time, he said.

"Re: Interview","Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

Steve

Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

	Subject:	 

	Vince,

	  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
	the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
	I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
	this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
	why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
	more about this.

	  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
	and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
	implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
	and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
	PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
	%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
	is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
	that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
	Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
	software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
	unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
	PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
	for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
	a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
	the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
	only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
	that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
	to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
	imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

	  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
	East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
	to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
	the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
	mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
	It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
	the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
	profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
	prices.

	  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
	form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
	price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
	get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
	regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
	mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
	prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

	  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
	of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
	involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
	necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
	actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
	exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
	participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
	model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
	significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

	Frank

Laura,

Given Greg Whalley's schedule, the best day for us to visit with you at Santa Fe
would be Wednesday, September the 5th. WE would arrive from San Francisco, early in the morning
and we could stay through the day.

Please, let me know if this date would work for you.

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Vince:

Greetings.

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was.

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public
Affairs Mike Rosen.

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26,
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or
whether you would prefer a subset thereof.

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy
Finance Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (Tel.:
512-232-7386) to coordinate matters.

The Colloquium at 3:00 PM on Tuesday, Sept. 25 will be:

COLLOQUIUM TITLE
My Manhattan Project: A Physicist's
Adventures on Wall St
Nigel Goldenfeld
Department of Physics
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
1110 West Green St
Urbana
IL 61801
http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel

Abstract
Why is Wall St. one of the biggest
employers of physicists? What is the
quickest way to lose a billion dollars? How
might academic physicists gain
experience of real world applications? And
why bother? I discuss these and
other questions in light of my own
experience, starting a software company
to market ultra-fast tools for risk
management of derivative securities.







Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in ""Econophysics.""  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an ""Econophysics"" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).

EDS is currently providing commercial applications using experts systems and textual mining to derive value for our customers.  The presentation below has two examples of current applications.  It seems to me that there a multiple applications for this type of program within Enron which would have short payback periods.

Gentlemen,

I woke up early as usual and wanted to help you, but the management had 
other plans.....

In the emotion of the moment last Friday, I was too choked up to say much, 
so let me try to make some amends this morning.  Of course, I hope to get 
together with you guys some day soon, but until then I'd like to say a 
couple of things.

The Weather Team was one of the best, most competent groups within Enron.  
It compared nationally with ""major-league"" meteorology, both public and 
private.  To break this team up is a serious offense to science.  I was 
proud to be a part of it, learning and growing personally and 
professionally.

I don't see how any job I find from here on out will compare to it.  The 
Research Group in general was the finest collection of minds and talent I've 
ever seen.  Vince chose them very carefully.  I just sort of wormed my way 
in, but I was practicing hard while sitting on the bench waiting for my 
chance to prove something.

And, perhaps more importantly, I have gained new friends. If there's 
anything you guys need, let me know.

Mike, as the rest of you know, has an amazing talent for bringing out the 
best in people.  As he told me Friday, I have indeed grown in the past two 
years.  The credit for much of it goes to Mike, who lives the philosophy 
that we called Enron.  Pity that some of the executives didn't.

I could ramble on for a while about this, but I won't bore you with it.  I 
just wanted to say that y'all are the best!  I'd appreciate an occasional 
e-mail if you hear some interesting company news.  Of course, I want to 
immediately know what happens to each of you.

Kevin, you need to get that home e-mail going buddy!

I'll keep you posted on my job hunt if I turn up anything.

You'll hear from me again! :-)

Sam

Sent:	Wednesday, July 25, 2001 12:46 PM

Subject:	EPRM course

Dear Prof. Kaminski,

first of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Lorenzo Pascual and a
collegue of mine and I attended the Energy Power Risk Management
course that took place in London some weeks ago. About my CV,
I have finished a Ph. D. in Mathematics (Statistics and Econometrics) at
University Carlos
III in Madrid (Spain), as well as a master degree in Mathematical
Finance,
both of them two months ago. In particular, in my dissertation I have
developed
new statistical techniques (using bootstrap methods) for forecasting
returns and volatilities
in the GARCH and Stochastic Volatility family of models. I have already
one published
article at the International Journal of Forecasting, and I have three
more papers under
revision in other international journals. Of course, if you are
interested in this kind of
research I can send to you a copy of the working papers.
Since then, I work for Endesa Trading
(spanish electricity company based in Madrid). However, at this moment I
am based here
in London for two years working in a joint venture with Morgan Stanley.

During the course I had the pleasure to talk with you and you gave me
the opportunity of
asking you some of the questions and doubts I have about energy
derivatives.
We did not have enough time to discuss anything deeply so, you asked me
to send all
the questions by email.

If you are in London, it would be for me a pleasure to meet you here for
lunch some day and then
we could talk much better about everything. If you can not, it will be
ok to use the email.

I hope you can find some time to help me with this. Of course, I thank
you very much in
advance for your help because I understand you are very busy.

The main questions I need to be solved are the following:

1. This first question is very important because I want to know how to
use Monte Carlo
    methods for pricing all kind of options on the forward price when no
analytical formula
    is available. To understand the procedure I have compared the
analytical formula with
    the monte carlo results. For example, when the price follows the
geometric brownian
    motion I have programed the analytical
    expression for a call on the forward price (see attached file in
matlab: price_gbm.m)
    (which corresponds with formula 6.5 in the book) together with
    the monte carlo method proposed in your book with Clewlow and
Strickland (chapter 7,
    see attached file: price_gbmMC.m). In this case I achieve the same
results. However,
    if I try to do the same exercise when the underlying follows the
simplest mean reversion
    process (formula 6.6), I obtain very different results using formula
(6.12) in the book (I think there
    is a printing mistake on it) and the Monte Carlo techniques. I do
not really understand
    what might be happening. You suggested me to send to you the matlab
files to check them
    more carefully. The names are price_mr.m and price_mrMC.m for the
analytical and monte
    carlo respectively.

    2. Could it be possible to have some of the data sets you use in the
book to check if I achieve the
        same estimated parameters with my programs ? (estimacion_mbg.m
and estimacion_mr.m)

    3.. Once you have estimated the unknown parameters from the data
set, in
         particular the speed of mean-reversion,
         and, if you want to use the option formula under
mean-reversion,
         which is the value for this parameter
         to introduce in the formula, the annualized one or not?

4. In case I have to use the annualized value into the pricing
formula, I have a very important question which
   is driving my crazy.
   In the particular case of electricity price series, the estimated
annualized speed of mean reversion I obtain are really very high,
   and very far from zero. In this case, if you compare the pricing
values obtained using the usual black formula
   and the one obtained under mean-reversion, we achieve very different
values. Is that correct? Did you have similar results
   to mine when working with electricity series? (I computed these two
values under the same volatility).

5. Going back to the previous point, why do we have to use the spot
price volatility and not the forward volatility
   in the pricing formula?
   I do not understand why, since the underlying in this case is the
forward price.

6. If I compute the speed of mean-reversion for the same data set,
working with hourly data and with daily data (constructed
   as the sample mean of the hourly observations) I obtain very
different values for this parameter (for the annualized value). Is that
normal?
   Can be the different volatility values in these two series the reason

of that? Should not be both numbers very similar (the annualized ones of
course)?

7. If the estimated numbers we obtain for the speed of mean-reversion
have to be
different depending on the time between observations,
   has it sense the following question? : if the underlying of my
product is a monthly forward price, should I compute
   the speed of mean-reversion ( I mean the annualized value) with
monthly spot prices?
   In such a case, I expect to obtain a value closer to zero than in the

   other cases (with hourly and daily data) and then, I will obtain a
pricing value not as different
   to that obtained with the usual Black formula.

8. Finally, can you give me references (papers, working papers,...)
about who to value swing options ?

Thank you very much in advance. You can not imagine how much I
appreciate your answers. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Lorenzo Pascual.

Thanks for the package of material.

On our side, Aug 24 is looking better than Aug 17, but we can do Aug 17 if
it is much better for you.

Hi Vince & Rick, attached is a resume of a friend of mine from when I worked in NYC.  This guys has MIT Aerospace background but has extensive trading and risk management experience--one of those with commercial and technical experience.  He is an excellent team player with great personality as far as working in stressed and dynamic environment goes. He will do well at Enron.  I think he is ready to try Houston like I did as he is ready to raise a family.

Please forward to appropriate parties if there are no immediate opportunities.

Vince,

Here is my edited version of the software license agreement.    Can you read it once before I forward it for internal approval?   I specified that the $100,000 covers a single  user  perpetural license,  access to source after one year,  and covers maintenance and support for one year.

Any suggestions?

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Would anyone be interested?....

Greetings Vince!
	During the brief idle moments we have here in the lab, I have been pondering yet another possible project.  We have built sensor boards and written programs to calculate the current flow along High Voltage Direct Current lines, the type that form the Western Inter-tie.    There are six of these lines to the west, i.e. to the WSCC  - four between WSCC and MAPP and two between WSCC and SPP.  It would seem to me to be valuable to know when there there power supply differences between these NERC regions and when power was flowing between them.  (In this case, directionality is no problem.  For once there is actually something flowing!)  Of course if this is useful, the project could expand to other inter-regional zones.  HVDC lines exist in the northeast between the large Canadian hydro projects and the metropolitan cities in New England.  Globally, there are several large grids being formed - one in Scandinavia, one in North Africa, an East Russian/Chinese system and a Russian/Korean/Japanese system.  Naturally these have to connect internally with DC lines as there are power frequency, power reliability and power control differences between each of the generating countries.
	You are the first person that I have told about this.  I didn't want to get anyone, especially my immediate supervisors, excited about a technology that I wasn't ready to provide.  I know that once I say that we could do it, the powers that be will want it NOW.  If you think that there is a market for this imformation I'll sneak out some weekend and collect a bit of data.  The nearest HVDC inter-tie is just north of Dallas so testing it would only take a day or two.  I am currently juggling two running chainsaws, a rabid dog and three vial of hepatitis so one more item in the mix won't make much of a difference at this point.  If no one needs to info, I'll just put the hardware and software on the shelf.

p.s.  Gina and I would like to take you out to lunch or dinner soon to a Sardinian restaurant.  Let us know when you would be free.  ( Your wife is invited, of course!)

Vince,

Thanks for the title and outline of your seminar.  I understand that
you must be pretty tied up at this time.  As for your visit, I will
pick you up at the Atlanta airport.  I will meet you at the exit of
the escalator.  Please remind me of you airline and flight number.  I'll
have my cellphone with me (678-637-8303).  One of my colleagues and I will
take you to dinner in the evening.  Your schedule on Thurs. is as follows.

I'll pick you up at the hotel around 9:30.  We will have an informal
meeting with one of my students from 9:50 to 10:50.  She will present
to you some ideas that we have been looking at on bandwidth trading.  We
are expecting to get some comments and feedbacks from you.  Your seminar
will be from 11am to 12noon.  Dr. Bob Kertz (our QCF program
director) will take you to lunch after the talk.  After the lunch, I
arrange you to meet with our students from 2pm to 3pm.  The time slot 3pm
to 4pm is open.  We will arrange a cab to get you at around 4pm.

I look forward to your visit.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Natural Gas Futures Jump on News of Tropical Storm Barry 
    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX gained 3.6% yesterday, up $0.111 to $3.192 per MMBtu on hot weather across much of the nation and the approach of a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida. The October contract rose $0.107 to $3.232 per MMBtu. Tropical Storm Barry is expected to strengthen today and move into the north-central Gulf of Mexico. Some weather forecasts expect that the storm will turn into a hurricane, and the growing likelihood that workers will soon have to be taken off Gulf of Mexico natural gas platforms has put traders on alert. But, despite the storm risk, there was only limited short-covering and volume was fairly light. However, strength in crude and products as well as Tropical Storm Barry encouraged buying by both trade, commercial accounts and the locals. Fundamentally, the market is still bearish, but that could change quickly if the storm does impact production. Sell stops were triggered as prices moved through the $3.20 level late in the session, bringing the market off its highs. On Wednesday, the market dropped over $0.20 following the release of AGA report data showing an injection of 77 Bcf last week. Hot weather is forecast for much of the nation early next week, with the West Coast returning to hot weather next week. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.10 to $0.15 per MMBtu lower yesterday, except out West where spot price climbed. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.17 to $3.15 per MMBtu. Look for cash prices to jump higher today.

Storm on Track to Disrupt Gulf Production
    Tropical Storm Barry formed off Florida's Gulf coast on yesterday and could become a hurricane today as it churns its way through the oil and natural gas fields of the Gulf of Mexico this weekend. The storm is most likely to make landfall on Sunday in Louisiana. Companies with offshore production have already taken steps to protect workers by moving them onshore until the storm passes but they added that they had not yet suspended any production. The National Hurricane Center forecasters predicts that Barry would move slowly to the northwest, taking it through the main producing areas of the central Gulf with a 55% chance that it would attain hurricane strength as it heads toward New Orleans. Chevron has evacuated 700 workers from offshore platforms as a precaution against the storm and will make further evacuations today. The Gulf of Mexico provides about one quarter of nation's production of both natural gas and crude oil; about 13 Bcf of natural gas per day and 1.4 million barrels of oil.

House Bill Addresses Energy Bond Status
    The House of Representatives has passed a wide-ranging energy bill that includes measures to permit tax-exempt bond financed public power utilities more access to deregulated power markets. Public utilities which are located in competitive markets would no longer be bound by existing tax law strictly limiting private use of facilities financed with tax-exempt bonds. However, they can continue to issue tax exempt financing for a limited amount of generation to serve their own load, but not for service outside their local area. Private and public utilities say they are satisfied with the bill, nut private utilities are disappointed that the bill left out a provision eliminating taxes on contributions in aid of construction. The bill includes measures that allow public power systems to join RTOs in order to improve the national transmission grid, without endangering outstanding bonds. The bill also makes an exception for prepaid natural gas contracts, which would apply only if at least 85% of the purchased volumes were for use by governmental utilities in the state where the bond issuer was located.

El Paso Chairman to Testify Again 
    El Paso Chairman, President and CEO William Wise will testify for a second time Monday in FERC's investigation into alleged manipulation of California's energy market. The California PUC claims that El Paso unfairly awarded 1.2 Bcf per day of firm capacity to its affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. Before the start of testimony, the FERC ALJ said that an April 2000 memorandum sent between Wise and another  official relates the minute details of everything that is happening in the company, showing that Mr. Wise was well aware of everything. That seems to run contrary to Wise's testimony at the previous May  hearing, where testified he did not micromanage the affairs of El Paso's subsidiaries. The California PUC testified that El Paso awarded the capacity in question by skewing the rules of an open season, saying it biased the open season in favor of the 'total package' bid. If a single bid for all of the capacity exceeded $37.5 million, then individual bids could only succeed if they exceeded the value of the total package bid to El Paso.  Therefore, even if they submitted partial package bids at reasonably high rates, their success was totally dependent upon the other partial package bids by other shippers. A total of 24 shippers submitted partial bids, and none of them were awarded any capacity, the PUC said. But El Paso disputed those claims, saying that it made the minimum economic criteria before the open season, thus giving no one an advantage.

Ladyfern Discovery May Yield Tcf of Natural Gas 
   Canadian Natural Resources is the latest to drill in what is being touted as one of the richest natural gas discoveries in Canada. The Ladyfern area, located in an isolated section of northeastern British Columbia, is estimated to contain up to 1 Tcf. Murphy Oil and Apache jointly drilled the first discovery well in the region a year ago, which is about 60 miles northeast of the oil hub, Fort St. John, BC. Acreage in the Ladyfern region has sold for 17 times the median paid for acreage in other parts of BC. It is likely second in size to the 1.8 Tcf Caroline, Alberta field in terms of Canadian onshore discoveries. Production is estimated at 480 MMcf per day. Canadian Natural is now producing 55 MMcf per day from one well, which is restricted by pipeline capacity. It expects to be producing 200 MMcf per day by the end of the year. Alberta Energy's output is about 170 MMcf per day.

Conflict of Interest Charged in California
    One California energy official has a stock portfolio full of big energy firms, while holds a million dollars in Enron stock. Even the governor's chief spokesman has $12,000 invested in Calpine. Consumer groups and Republicans are claiming conflict of interest among top Democratic officials charged with helping California out of its energy crisis. But the governor says it is a politically inspired witch hunt aimed at smearing his administration by implying something is illegal. Whatever, but it is still another pie in the face the governor whose political viability seems to be fading almost as fast as his friend, Gary Condit. Charges of conflict of interest surfaced last month as the Secretary of State called for a probe of consultants negotiating long-term energy deals designed to protect California from price swings on the spot market. The governor fired five consultants last weekend after belatedly asking them to file required economic disclosure statements. Journalists have been busy digging up financial details on a bunch of Davis appointees that create the impression personal greed was driving California's official energy policy. In one case, the chairman of the California Energy Commission owned as much as $510,000 in energy company stock at one point last year, it was reported.

I am with Enron?s thermal power generation company in Panama. Ours is the largest thermal power plant (320 MW) in a system with over 540 MW in hydro power capacity. In order to better program our operations for the next two years, it would help us to determine the probability of another El Nino event in the next 18 to 24 months. In case of a high probability we could even bring down a barge-mounted plant to provide back up power to Panama?s and other Central American countries which are heavily dependent on hydro power. Panama and Central America suffers serious droughts during an El Nino event.

Whatever help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Vince,
 
I talked to Sean, and asked him to prepare Zhiyong for our meeting with him.
Zhiyong and Sean had an agreement that Zhiyong would support Sean when the
time comes for Sean to transfer to Research.  
 
Unfortunitely Zhiyong can not make it for Friday's meeting because I just heard he
had a car accident and may stay in hospital for a week (flower?).  Sean will visit Zhiyong
in the hospital and will bring up this issue. I think as long as we allow Sean to have
enough time for his transition (help Zhiyong out), Zhiyong would agree. If Zhiyong did
not make any noise, things should be just fine.
 
 
Zimin
 
PS: Thanks for the support you have been giving me. I think that Paulo and I will work out
things to maximize the Research value.

Dear Dr Kaminsky,

on behalf of the Scientific Committee of the 2nd World Congress of the
Bachelier Finance Society, it is my pleasure to invite you to give one of
the plenary lectures.

The Bachelier Finance Society came into being in 1996 by the initiative of
mathematical finance researchers who found the need to create an
organization where academia and practitioners would meet and exchange
ideas spanning on the crossroads between Finance, Economics, Econometrics,
Insurance and Mathematics.

The conference is the Society's second biannual meeting and it will take
place in the island of Crete, from June 12 to June 15, 2002.
The other members of the Scientific Committee are G.Constantinides,
M.Davis, F.Delbaen, D.Duffie, H.Foellmer, M.Jeanblanc and E.Platen.
Either myself or any other member of the committee would be happy to
discuss with you about the Conference and the Society.

Crete is one of the most beautiful greek islands. The conference will take
place in a resort in Xersonissos, a picturesque site close to Irakleion
and Knossos. The airfare (economy class) and all local expenses (lodging,
meals and local transportation) will be covered.

We will all be honored by your presence.

Sincerely,

Thaleia Zariphopoulou

Chair of the Scientific Committee
V.N.Neuhaus Professor
Dpts of Mathematics and MSIS
The University of Texas at Austin

I can't thank you enough for your help.  I supported your group as an HR
generalist from February 1998 through year end 1999 when I transitioned it to
Sheila Walton and her team.  As you may recall, I also served as Sheila's
backup (until December 2001) for more senior level work in your group, i.e.,
conducting your PRC meeting.

Thanks again.  Hope you are doing well in spite of the turmoil.

Best regards,

Cindy Skinner

I don't know what hiring (if any) you are contemplating under our present circumstances, but wanted to pass his resume along to you.  I will also send it to Maureen and Gwen to see if they are interested.

Dear Ms. Magee:
 
It was a great pleasure to meet you at the NSHMBA Career Fair in San Antonio, Texas and to learn more about employment opportunities at Enron. Our conversation reinforced my desire to join Enron's Associate Program. I am positive that my strong analytical skills, specific knowledge of industry regulation and working experience overseas, particularly in the energy sector would be great assets to your organization. 
 
As I mentioned to you during the conference, through my career and during my MBA studies at the Simon School (University of Rochester) and the London School of Economics (LSE), where I earned a MS in Industry Regulation, I have gained strong analytical skills and an excellent understanding of the global trends in the energy sector, especially of those related to the deregulation of the industry. Furthermore, working as an economist at the Vice-Ministry of the Treasury in Bolivia allowed me to gain hands-on experience in quantitative and financial analysis. These experiences have been complemented by my recent summer internship with British Petroleum (BP) Latin America where I was responsible for developing a valuation model to determine the acquisition price of a liquefied petroleum gas distributing company. As a result, I was directly exposed to the extraordinary prospects of the energy sector and to the expectations and needs of energy companies. 
 
My current studies at the Simon School have also helped me further develop my finance and communication skills, which are essential for a position with Enron. I am confident I will be able to contribute positively to your organizations success. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my professional qualifications and personal qualities fit Enron present activities and its plans for the future. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any specific related to my credentials, please do not hesitate to contact me to the following telephone number: (716) 271 0934.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Marcos A. Tapia

Natural Gas Futures Continue Lower 

Natural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower yesterday as traders remained in a bearish mood following Wednesday's triple digit AGA report. The July contract lost $0.074 to $4.038 per MMBtu, trading most of the session above the $4.00 support level as warm weather in the Northeast kept demand firm. August dipped $0.088 to $4.123 per MMBtu. Local and short-term traders' early efforts to push prices lower were successful, but some see the risk/reward of additional selling at these levels limited. On Wednesday, the AGA reported a storage inventory build of 105 Bcf from the previous week, well above both the 2000 injection of 78 Bcf and the 5-year average of 81 Bcf for the comparable weeks. The selling sparked by the AGA number was encouraged by some disappointment with weather conditions in the Northeast. Earlier this week, some forecasters were calling for warmer temperatures, with some cities expected to be near 90 degrees. But temperatures in the region have been in the low to mid-80s. However, warmer weather is expected to continue in the East though this weekend. Mild weather will linger in the north-central and northwestern states. California and the western states will begin to heat up this weekend and early next week. Further tests of $4.00 are likely, with significant support at $3.80. Resistance is seen at $4.20. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.15  $0.25 yesterday, except out west, where the Topock delivery point tumbled over $1.00. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.16 to $3.97 per MMBtu.

Nova Scotia Wants Royalty Revenue

Nova Scotia wants a bigger share of the cash generated by its oil and natural gas reserves to fund the regulators needed to monitor the growing industry, according to the provinces Premier. Speaking at an energy conference in Halifax, he pleaded with the federal government to let the province keep more of the royalties. A 1986 offshore deal between Canada and Nova Scotia names the province as the main beneficiary of offshore oil and natural gas royalties, but the actual revenue split gives Ottawa 81% and Nova Scotia 19%. Nova Scotia already exports natural gas to New England from the Sable Offshore Energy Project. A possible second pipeline proposal to the Northeast US is being studied.

California Expects More Power Price Regulation

California lawmakers expect the FERC to strengthen its existing plan to limit power prices during emergencies by expanding the plan to the entire West for all hours of the day. The plan would fall short of the price caps. But, expanding the existing formula for price limits has picked up support among Republicans who are under increasing pressure. FERC Chairman Hebert has called a special commission hearing for Monday to address the continuing issues affecting California and the West. The proposal seeks to have FERC set target prices for wholesale electricity prices on an around-the-clock basis for the entire West. Under the existing plan, the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plant. Hebert says that since the FERC relief plan went into effect on May 29th, power prices in California have dropped to under $100 per MWh from earlier in May over the $300 per MWh. The day-ahead market in California recently traded about $45 per MWh.

Williams to Supply California Ethanol

Williams Bio-Energy has agreed to supply ethanol to California by the fourth quarter of this year. Earlier this week, the EPA denied California's request to waive provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act requiring the use of additives to make cleaner-burning gasoline. The decision means California will need about 580 million gallons of ethanol for RFG oxygenates in 2004, because the state banned MTBE by the end of 2002. Williams will house 15,000 barrels of ethanol at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners storage facility in Carson, California, to supply the Los Angeles and San Diego markets. Williams plans transport ethanol to the storage facility and directly to refiners by large unit rail shipments and ocean vessels.

Mitchell Reports Higher Proven Reserves

    Mitchell Energy & Development reports its proven reserves are up 38% in the first half of the year. Mitchells proved reserves have increased by 580 Bcfe, putting its total reserves at 2.1 Tcfe. The single biggest increase, 210 Bcfe, came from its most successful field, the Barnett Shale play in North Texas. The new reserves came from step-out drilling; drilling which occurs outside the previously confirmed area in the Barnett Shale, the fourth-largest producing field in Texas. Mitchell currently holds 230,000 acres of the Barnett and has drilled the area for almost 50 years.

Natural Gas Investments in Mexico at Risk of Drying Up 

Mexico has made changes to its natural gas price formulas, but they have proved insufficient to appease distributors, and Metrogas, Tractebel and Sempra are threatening to halt investment in new projects. A more efficient and more competitive regulatory standard is required. The Mexican regulatory commission for energy, the CRE has not changed the reference for prices which remains southern Texas. The federal commission for regulatory improvements has a week to decide whether to accept the CRE's proposals. Mexico will require private sector investment of $114 Billion by 2009 in the sector. The companies want to see a new standard established before the end of the year and all are thinking about pulling out if laws are not clear and in place. The CRE wants to adjust maximum prices only when the private companies have completed five years of Mexican operations, something which will occur in most cases next year. Pemex still controls rights on natural gas exploration.

House Appropriations Committee Rejects Power Price Caps

Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have rejected a push by Democrats to cap West Coast power prices, but Democrats said they will keep pressing the issue. The panel voted along party lines to defeat a bill to force FERC to cap wholesale electricity prices in the West. Democrats tried to stick the measure in a $6.5 billion spending bill that was intended mainly to fill out immediate defense needs this fiscal year. Rejecting the price caps amendment, Republicans argued it would not solve California's problems of tight supplies, but would further distort the marketplace. House Republican Whip DeLay of Texas said California's power crisis is the result of allowing environmental extremists to run the state government. Saying the federal government should not intervene in California's electricity market, Rep. Callahan of Alabama, who chairs the House Appropriations Energy and Water subcommittee, said: I respectfully submit to you that you've made your own bed. Democrats countered that limiting prices to cover production costs and a reasonable profit was essential to halt price gouging by unscrupulous suppliers. Democrats hoped to persuade a few West Coast Republicans to support the price caps, but those on the committee resisted. Under the existing plan, the FERC price limits are triggered when the state declares a power emergency and are based on the amount that generators can charge to produce power at the least efficient plant. Generators can charge more if it can be justified.

Dominion Plans WV Coal Fired Plant 

Dominion and Anker Energy have plans to develop with a $600 Million, 450 MW, coal and coal waste fired facility and mining complex in Upshur County, WV. Dominion would be responsible for the construction, ownership and operation of the proposed facility, which will utilize state-of-the-art clean coal technology and would burn more than 65% coal waste. Anker would provide all of the facility's fuel from on-site surface mining operations. This proposed coal-fired plant is the first Dominion has developed since payingt $1.2 billion to the EPA last November for Clean Air Act violations pertaining to its coal-fired facilities. The proposed facility will be developed with NOx reducing equipment built-in. Also, the plant will utilize circulating fluidized bed boilers, technology that allows coal to be burned more efficiently. The CFB boilers can also burn low heat-content coal and waste fuel, something traditional burners cannot. All coal and coal waste produced will be burned on-site. Limestone will be used to react with sulfur in the coal to lower SO2 emissions.

APGA Believes Market Manipulated 

Unsatisfied by the federal government's explanation that the high gas prices last winter were due mainly to supply and demand, the American Public Gas Association says it believes the recent price drop is a signal that the market may have been unfairly manipulated. In a letter sent to the EIA and to key lawmakers, APGA insists that the supply/demand explanations do not tell the full story. Rather, the association of municipal gas systems believes price speculation played a major role in the dramatic upswing in prices during the 2000-2001 heating season. Citing FERC's investigation into gas prices at the California border, APGA said it is concerned not only about that point, but also that market power gained through the unregulated control of pipeline capacity will lead to unjust and unreasonable prices for natural gas service throughout the US. APGA says it is convinced that the true cause of record prices for gas will not be known unless the role played by energy traders and price speculators is examined.

The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.
Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.

Vince,

Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him with no trouble at all.

Thanks,
Anne

Dear Vince
 
I have not heard from you for a few days and was  wondering what is happening. The last time I spoke to Shelley, everything was  fine and that you were still going ahead with your presentation and  co-presenting the workshop on energy risk.
 
Please do reply to put my mind at  rest!
 
Thank you

Dear Vince

I recently saw an announcement of Enron's risk management chair at Rice
University.  Do you know about it or the people at Rice?  While I'm having a
great time working with Swiss Re here, I am thinking about coming home for
my wife's sake.  Do you think that Rice would be open to a person in risk
management with an insurance as well as a finance background?  That was
certainly not true at Texas and that's why I'm asking.

I hope all is well there with you.  I did appreciate your presentation to my
finance classes there at the University of Texas a couple of years ago.  I
also appreciated the assistance that you recently gave one of my Texas Ph.
D. students.  He was and I still am working on pricing weather derivatives.

Subject:	Having Iris visit London

Hi Amitava,

We've been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we'll provide to Darryl Duffie.  We think it would be extremely valuable for Iris to come out to London for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed.  I think this would greatly enhance the ""product"" we'll send to Duffie as well as giving Iris a firm view of Enron Credit.  In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as Amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling.  If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.

I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Cheers,
Scott

Vince,
 
I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. 
 
Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than  usual.
 
Talk  to you later.

Subject:	help finding finance work

Dear Vince,

Just to remind you, I will be graduating this May with an MBA from Rice.  My
concentration is in finance, but I'm also an undergraduate engineer from
Cornell University and an IT specialist.

I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I
can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search.  I've been
somewhat frustrated trying to explain why I'm more effective than my peers.
Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three
months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year.  This was
probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into
program code quickly and reliably.

I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and
show quick success.  What I can't say in my resume is that I'm the best in
my class at finance, statistics, and information technology.  However, this
combination is also my biggest crutch.  I'd like to engage all my skills,
but typically, interviewers are only looking for one.

Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in
my skill set?  I'm indifferent to moving anywhere in the U.S.

Vince, in any case, I appreciate your time and any suggestions you could
offer.  I had a wonderful time working for you, we really had a good team.
If you have any questions for me, please call or email me at any time.

Sincerely,
Chris Pernoud

P.S. If your son ever wants to startup a linux company, I'd be interested in
helping, he could email me at cgp1@cornell.edu.

Thanks for your  message.

I have talked briefly to Rick about it and we came to the conclusion that we could substitute Greg Whalley 
for Jeff. I assume that your interest is more in having a speaker from Enron than a specific person.

Of course, we have to get on Greg's calendar but I can make these arrangements as soon as I hear from you.

Greetings.

With the two-week passage of time since the 8/14 announcement, I write at
this time to inquire:

1.  Has sufficient time elapsed for this to be a propitious time to raise
this issue?
2.  Does the issue require re-visiting, and would a renewed invitation be
favorably received by both Skilling and Enron?

My colleagues and I look forward to Vince's 9/10 visit.  Best,

We filed with FERC last week and I'm sending you the Wall Street Journal and

At the end of the session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.
 
I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your research group.
 
Thank you for your time.

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,

Dear Director Kaminski,

Thank you very much for your kind offer of helping me
with next year's summer intern. I really regret that I
cannot take this opportunity because our class of 2002
will graduate next May.

I have great passion to work in your department as a
part-time employee. Time of morning work is not a
problem for me. I can get up at 5:00 a.m. to prepare
for work.

Thank you again for your help!

Best wishes,
Alex

"Help for Krishnarao Pinnamaneni","Wade,

I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who
faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna
from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.

A brief outline of the facts.

1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years
ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival
was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy
is also very complicated.

2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a 
tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the
term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with
the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.

The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an 
outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American 
society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his 
behalf to the State Department.

I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational
approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.

I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's
behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. 
I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.

Thanks.

Vince

Thanks for your message.

We definitely plan to visit with you, as planned, next Wednesday.

Vince,

Since we agreed in our conference call that we have not exchanged any
confidential or proprietary technical information up to this time and do
not expect to need to exchange such information in our next meeting
(your visit to Santa Fe) we would prefer not to sign an NDA covering
technical information at this time.

We would be happy to sign an NDA covering the content of the business
discussion itself.  We are happy to refrain from revealing to others
that we are talking to you and/or revealing any details about our
possible business relationship.  We would be happy to provide you with
such an NDA if you would like or you can draft one and present it to us.

We will move forward under the assumption that you agree with the
above.  Please contact me if you do not.

Given events in Enron that were announced today are we still on for the
5th and will Greg still be coming?

Vince, 

EBS has sponsored a $3500 table at the FRIEND level.  You could either do that, or you could do a $1000 table at the MEMBER level --- Enron is already a corporate member.  Either table provides for an acknowledgment in the program.

The $1000 table provides for 10 people, whereas the $3500 table provides seating for 8 people from our side plus 2 student interns placed by IACCGH at local companies will also sit at our table.

Either table would be great (I would not go any higher).  I guess the only difference would be distance of table from the front.

Thanks,
Vasant

Hi Vince,

	Chitra wanted me to check with you to see if you (Enron Research) would be interested in sponsoring a table at the annual gala dinner with the Consul General, and the Indian Ambassador.  People associated with India projects (Sandeep, Krishna, etc) may benefit.  Of course, if you are sponsoring, I would like to be invited.  

	EBS is sponsoring one table, and that is the only Enron participation so far.

CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote 
Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of  their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a ""preference payment"" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment.  The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.  It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently.  Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.  This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:
I assume that Prof. Oren has sent to you an e-mail in which he  informed of our ongoing purpose of organizing an international conference on Ten  year of Electricity Deregulation and Restructuring. He attached a very  preliminary agenda as well with all the people and lectures committed  already.
I would like to formally invite you to come to Spain by  December 17-18 to give a lecture of around 45 minutes on the key  issues that operators and energy services and trading companies are confronting  in assessing the risk chain in the new deregulated environment business:  adequacy risks, trading risk management, capacity markets, etc.
Regarding budget and expenses, I can allocate $2.500,  plus a bonus should we break even, to cover your traveling and emoluments.  We will take care of the lodging as well.
 
Please feel free to contact me if you need further details. As  soon as we have some more formal description of the Conference and a first  definitive schedule I will send it to you.
 
Let me have your response whenever you are able to do  so.
 
Best regards.

Dear Vince,
How are you doing? It was very nice seeing you the other day, and hope everything is fine with you.
Sorry for the delay in email, I was very busy moving for the past few days. Will you email me your personal email account? I don't want to lose contact with you. And I can be reached by my lifetime email account:li.sun.wg00@wharton.upenn.edu 
It is pretty sad to witness what is happening at Enron, and all you were worried about before is coming true earlier than expected. I wish we should have done more to prevent this from happening.
Anyway, I am planning to leave the country and go back to China as I am only allowed to stay here for at most 60 days after employment termination. Please keep in touch, and if you have chance, please come and visit me in Beijing, it will be my honor to be your tour guide and show you around.
Happy holidays and wish you all the best!

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a

Subject:	recommendation of an outstanding Baylor MBA student for summer  internship


Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.  Rusty is a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these issues pertain to the energy industry.   In fact, you met Rusty during your recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an interview for a summer internship on April 19.  He has been invited by Althea Gordon.  If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.   Rusty is one of the very best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

Vince,

I've been meaing to ask you about the paper I sent to Sam on calculating implied pdf's for futures prices. Sam told me that you didn't want to include it in RI because it and the EOL article gave too much away.  I've talked with several folks about the approach outlined in the paper.  I've reworked the paper to try and better tailor it to traders, and I'd be interested in your feedback.

Subject:	Finance Club: e-trading and Fixed Income Markets Workshop


As faculty advisor to the Finance Club, Prof. Barb Ostdeik is encouraging
all members to take advantage of a great opportunity to learn more about
trading operations from two very respected individuals in the industry.
Keith Anderson of BlackRock, Inc (JGSM 1983) and Dexter Senft of Lehman
Brothers & TradeWeb LLC (Rice 1974) have visited the Jones School to give
this lecture and students have raved about them. Albert Wang's Fixed Income
and Advanced Investments classes are required to attend, and James Weston
recommends for his Applied Finance students and any first years taking
Investments next year to be there.

When:
9:45 a.m. - 11:15 a.m.
Wednesday
April 18

Where:
Room 117
Herring Hall

Presentation/Discussion Topics:
Trading Tactics - phone trades vs. electronic trading
Evolution of e-trading in fixed income markets
The future of the trading desk
Buy-side vs. Sell-side issues

Speaker Profiles:

Keith Anderson, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Income
of BlackRock, Inc., is co-head of the Fixed Income Operating Committee,
Chairman of the Investment Strategy Group and a member of BlackRock's
Management Committee.   Mr. Anderson is responsible for global fixed income
strategy, asset allocation and the overall management of client portfolios.
He coordinates a team of thirty-two portfolio managers and more than
twenty-five credit and quantitative analysts.

Mr. Anderson is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, which
meets quarterly in Washington, D.C. with the Secretary and Staff of the U.S.
Treasury to advise them on the financing and management of the Federal debt.

Prior to founding BlackRock in 1988, Mr. Anderson was a Vice President in
Fixed Income Research at The First Boston Corporation, working in mortgage
securities and derivative products strategies.  Mr. Anderson with Criterion
Investment Management Company where he had primary responsibility for a $2.8
billion fixed income portfolio.

Mr. Anderson has authored numerous articles on fixed income strategies,
including two articles in The Handbook of Fixed Income Options: ""Scenario
Analysis and the Use of Options in Total Return Portfolio Management"" and
""Measuring, Interpreting, and Applying Volatility within the Fixed Income
Market"".




Dexter Senft is a Managing Director with global responsibility for Fixed
Income electronic commerce for Lehman Brothers. During his eight years at
the firm, he has also managed or co-managed Lehman's Fixed Income Research,
Quantitative Research, Counterparty Credit and Global Economics departments.

Mr. Senft is the former Chairman of TradeWeb LLC, a consortium-owned
electronic bond trading system whose volume currently averages over $10
billion per day, and of which Lehman Brothers is a founding shareholder. He
remains on TradeWeb's Board, and chairs TradeWeb's trading protocol
committee, which oversees the rules that govern the electronic flow of
information within the system.

Mr. Senft also serves on the Bond Market Association's Committee for
Alternative Trading Systems, as well as its Online Bond Steering Committee
and he chairs the subcommittee on e-commerce protocols and standards.

Prior to EJV, Mr. Senft spent 17 years at The First Boston Corporation (now
part of CS First Boston), where he was a Managing Director and head of Fixed
Income Research and Product Development. He is a widely published author of
articles on mortgage securities, fixed income derivatives, and quantitative
portfolio management, and his work continues to be among the readings for
CFA applicants. In 1983, Mr. Senft led the product team that created the
first CMO for Freddie Mac.


This is regarding the e-trading/bond market session
arranged for April 18.  As part of the 1st year finance elective, you may
have already been informed by James Weston (Were you?) but I need to get
the info out to more 2nd years as well.

Do you usually send out your speaker announcements to all faculty,
students, and staff?

Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to
come and James Weston will be encouraging 1st years that took the finance
elective to come.

These guys are pretty good - they came a few years back.

Thanks.

Vince,

Thanks for the note and suggestion on the campus presentation.  I'll defer to you and Traci on this.  

My opinion is that I would not invest the business time and hard dollars on it, unless you see this program as a good ""feeder"" for your area.  My recommended path would be for you to do the speech, collect resumes, and pass out business cards.  We can then use our ""direct"" approach with this school, and peruse the resume book to see if there is anyone that looks like a match with our needs.  The next step would be to try to bring in some fulltime or even intern candidates and see how they perform.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss.

Thanks,
Billy

P.S.  I really appreciate you attending the dinner Wednesday night at Enron Field.

Vince,

The MetBox is performing as per our high expectations - Adam and Chris
got it up and running in an unbelievably short time, we were able to
make a great call on Tropical Storm Barry, the termination of the recent
heat wave, it seems to have resulted in more highly skilful 6-10 day
forecasts already (based on our weekly look-backs), we're getting critical NWS
update information 10 min sooner than the web or outside services, and
are progressing well on internal modelling efforts.

Along that line, we are ready for what we call the MM5 box, really just
a computer built just like the MetBox, but souped up for the specific purpose of being dedicated to
feeding off the MetBox and cranking model scenarios. It will also serve as a backup.

If we bought it from PDI, it would be about 10K, but we (Chris & Adam)
can component together a replica of the MetBox for $3600. 

IT says this computer product is too specialized for them to acquire and build.

We do the impossible daily.

If you would like a verbal review, we can get together at your convienence.  Or if the attached .doc and .xls files are sufficient, just give me the word and consider it done.

Mike

One of our potential customers provided us with MS's daily price sheet from earlier this week.  Interesting to see the JCC offers that have been provided.  Some of the WTI offers look fairly rich as well, particularly the 10 yr price.  MS also requires fairly hefty cash collateral requirements.

Subject:	Full-Time Associate Orientation - Happy Hour


On Monday August 6, about 75 new full-time Associates will be starting their careers at Enron.  Attached is a schedule of Orientation Topics, as well as an invitation to welcome these Associates at a Happy Hour Monday evening.  It would be great if you could stop by, even for just a few minutes, to welcome them to the company.  For your convenience, the Happy Hour is at Farrago, which is less than 6 blocks from the Enron Building.   

Members of the Program regularly tell us that senior level interaction is an area that we can improve on, so your participation in events like this very important.  An RSVP is not required, but if you plan to attend, please let us know so we can prepare a name tag for you.  Feel free to extend this invitation to other senior members of your team.

As always, we appreciate your continued support of The Program.

Regards,
Billy

Hi Vince!
 
How are you? This is just a brief note to let you know I'm very much enjoying my time here at Carnegie Mellon. Adapting to the student lifestyle after working for three years was a bit discouraging at the beginning, but with time I began to appreciate it. This is the second week of our second mini-semester... I am finding the finance related coursework a good review, and the math and programming related coursework very interesting and useful. Our class is very small, approximately 30 people. I really miss Houston and Enron... Pittsburgh is a nice city, although I have little time to truly explore what it has to offer. 
 
I hope you're doing well. 
 
Sincerely,
 
-Hector

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our ""New Era"" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

My associate, Steve Leppard, sent me a message about a conversation he had with you 
regarding books on quantitative aspects of trading different commodities.

I shall be very glad to talk to you about different approaches we can take (books ranging from
a very general introduction to different commodity markets to highly technical treaties) and
about the contribution  Enron could make.

You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, ""Managing Energy
Price Risk"", 2nd edition. This collection of papers was probably the best selling book Risk published
so far. It is a good starting point to a conversation about different  options you might consider.

Please, feel free to give me a call. My direct number is 713 853 3848.

Dear Mr.Kaminski,

I have found the EnronOnline project a very interesting one and have enjoyed
working with everyone in the Research department as well as those from other
departments. I am keenly interested in this area and was wondering if there
would be any summer internship opportunities. I have attached my resume to
this mail for your review and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you

Hello, I am producing this year's 'Real Options Training Course' on behalf
of the Risk Waters Group in NY.  I am very interested in hearing your
comments and suggestions regarding the issues surrounding real options, in
addition to hearing what type of research Enron has been doing with real
options (as well as a possible speaker position).  Thanks again, I look
forward to speaking with you.

"Prediction  Company","Greg,

A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.
More detailed notes by Steve are attached.

I. Major potential projects (in the order they suggested it).

	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market
	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.

	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without
	full trade automation.

	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.

	Any project would require review of the market data provided by Enron.  (Is it a  free option for them? -  VK)
 
II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments 
   per project, and   fees per transaction.

	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 
	    Enron's participation.

	2. Payment per project that would look like consulting fees. They would like a lump-sum payment
	    first (to expand the staff), followed by consulting fees later. 

	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through
	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support
	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify
	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.


Recommendations:

	1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.

	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship
                with UBS.

	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from
	    Prediction Company.

	Vince

Summary of MSCF Advisory Board Meeting
December 12, 2001

Advisory Board Members in attendance:

Ashvin Chhabra
First Vice President
Director of Financial Strategies and Analytics
Merrill Lynch

Joseph Langsam
Managing Director
Morgan Stanley

Art Mbanefo
Managing Director
Equity Derivatives and Convertible Trading
Credit Suisse First Boston

James Vinci
Partner
Paloma Partners Management

David Waldman
Senior Portfolio Manager and Director
Fixed Income Quantitative Research Group
Putnam Investments

Carnegie Mellon Faculty in attendance:

Richard Bryant
Director
M.S. program in Computational Finance

David Heath
Hoch Professor of Mathematical Sciences

John Lehoczky
Lord Professor of Statistics
Dean, College of Humanities and Social Sciences

Steve Shreve
Professor of Mathematical Sciences

The three new members of the board, Ashvin Chhabra,
Art Mbanefo and David Waldman, were asked to present their
perspective on future human resource needs of the industry.

David reported that Putnam relies on both fundamental
and quantitative analysis.  In fixed income markets,
he noted the shift from treasuries to mortgages and corporate
bonds, and pointed out the accompanying rise in
the importance of credit risk analysis.  Although Putnam
has been a major employer of MSCF students, he noted that
increased emphasis in our program on the asset management
industry would be welcomed.  He pointed out the need
for our students to understand how to translate theory
into practice and to communicate to audiences of
various backgrounds.  For David, applicants should be able
to pass the ""airport test:""  if you are stuck with this guy
for half a day in the airport, will it be a reasonably
interesting experience.

Art also emphasized the key role of communication skills.
He wants people who are very focussed and who can find
practical solutions.  He welcomes applicants who have prior
accomplishments which show they can be trained and have
discipline.  He cited music and athletics as areas in which
these traits can be demonstrated.

Ashvin proposed that students should prepare for the ""elevator
test:"" if you happen to ride the elevator with a managing
director, between the sixth floor and the lobby can you
explain something to him in a way that he appreciates.  Ashvin
believes that MSCF students, and quants in general, must
either be able to work on the trading desk or have management
skills if they are to survive in the long term.  He expects
there to be growth in demand for people who understand
technology and business.  He thinks personal finance
services will also be an area of growth.

Echoing one of Ashvin's points, Joe would be interested in
people with the skills to manage IT projects.

Two subjects raised by Rick are whether the MSCF program should
specialize, say into energy or asset management, and whether
there should be additional courses in subjects such as
accounting and corporate finance.  The consensus was that
the MSCF program should stay general, within the quantitative
finance niche, and should remain highly quantitative rather than
tipping toward an MBA.

There was discussion of the desirability of internships.  Joe
pointed out that 80% of the Morgan Stanley hiring is from
internships.  An internship doesn't have to be for a summer;
eight weeks is possible.  Steve observed that we have not in
the past had difficulty placing students even though our program
does not include an internship and that an internship would
lengthen the program beyond 12 months.  Joe said that a
longer MSCF program with internships would permit different
student cohorts to overlap so new students could learn from those
who had interned.  Faculty would also be enriched by
students who had interned.

Please review the attached documents and provide us comments by COB  tomorrow, Wednesday, December 19, to assist in finalizing EEI  and the Alliance of Energy Suppliers  filing in the Market Based Rate  proceedings.  Attached you will find a market assessment and impact  predictions of noted economists, Bill Hogan and Steve Harvey.  
 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at alliance@eei.org  or (202) 508-5098
 
 
EEI's Comments/Recommendations on Hogan/Harvey  Paper
The theoretical discussion (from the second full paragraph on page 3  through the end of page 5) should be moved to the end as a technical  appendix.  I'm concerned that if it stays in its current place, readers  will be thrown off track and maybe even stop there.
 
The last two paragraphs of section III.A. are very hard to read (page  7).  Whether they are necessary is a question I have not yet  considered.
 
Their advisement against price caps (see section V.i. at pages 19-20) will  run counter against some of our wires members.
 
Their recommended alternatives (section VI, pages 20-23) are only loosely  tied to my work request.  I am uncomfortable with proposals related to  plant divestiture for large sellers (pages 21-22) and minimum interconnection  standards (page 22.)
 
On another front, a comment came in suggesting that the definition of  incremental cost should include accelerated (physical) depreciation.

Dear Vince,

We've been asked by our clients for our view on Enron's situation and
outlook. I feel a need to respond to these requests and have written the

I would like to offer you -- my primary contact at Enron -- an opportunity
to review and correct any factual errors. Interpretations, of course, remain
my responsibility.

I reiterate my long-standing admiration for the Company and all it has
contributed. I have had an opportunity to discuss the prospect with people
in policy positions and desire first of all to do no harm by misstatement
and second to be as helpful as I can be.

If you choose not to comment I will understand that as well, but would
appreciate some indication on your part. I will of course keep our
correspondence on this between us in any event. Thanks.

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

ABSTRACT:
 Event risk is the risk that a portfolio's value can be affected
 by large jumps in market prices. Event risk is synonymous with
 ""fat tails"" or ""jump risk"". Event risk is one component of
 ""specific risk"", defined by bank supervisors as the component of
 market risk not driven by market-wide shocks. Standard
 Value-at-Risk (VaR) models used by banks to measure market risk
 do not do a good job of capturing event risk. In this paper, I
 discuss the issues involved in incorporating event risk into
 VaR. To illustrate these issues, I develop a VaR model that
 incorporates event risk, which I call the Jump-VaR model. The
 Jump-VaR model uses any standard VaR model to handle ""ordinary""
 price fluctuations and grafts on a simple model of price jumps.
 The effect is to ""fatten"" the tails of the distribution of
 portfolio returns that is used to estimate VaR, thus increasing
 VaR. I note that regulatory capital could rise or fall when
 jumps are added, since the increase in VaR would be offset by a
 decline in the regulatory capital multiplier on specific risk
 from 4 to 3. In an empirical application, I use the Jump-VaR
 model to compute VaR for two equity portfolios. I note that, in
 practice, special attention must be paid to the issues of
 correlated jumps and double-counting of jumps. As expected, the
 estimates of VaR increase when jumps are added. In some cases,
 the increases are substantial. As expected, VaR increases by
 more for the portfolio with more specific risk.

 Keywords: Specific risk, market risk, jump risk, jump
 diffusion, default risk

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

Dear Ms. McVicker,

Thank you for your help in arranging a speaker from your group to come to Wharton. There is a lot of excitement here currently about the energy industry, and we have a very active Energy group that arranges engagements and discussions. 

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry, though we are open to any suggestions of the speaker. Questions include:
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday at
4:30 PM. Dates open are September 24, Oct 1, Nov 5, Nov 12. A presentation is followed by Q&A and then a suggested dinner and cocktails with Prof. Paul Kleindorfer and a few students.

Thank you again for your help. I look forward to hearing back from you or someone in your group.

Sincerely, 

Amy Richard

Vince:

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,
Ehud

have major conflicts and cannot attend on this date. If there is anyone else
who cannot make the date, please let me know.

The output from the sub groups will be the key agenda items along with a

terrifically appreciated. (Have received input from Bob Peebler, Fran Keeth,
Denise Huggins, Tim Tipton)  As expected, the input is quite good and
important direction for us.  We would hope to get as much feedback as
possible before the meeting.

For those of you who have not yet responded, we would be happy to meet with
you or your designates at your office after the first of the year if you

respond to the e-mail questionnaires that would be great.

Again, we very much appreciate your participation on the Energy Committee.

Happy Holidays to All

As per our conversation yesterday I would very much appreciate it if you could help me with this matter.  I was under the impression that I would be promoted to Associate this August, which according to my pay stub and eHRonline hasn't occurred.  According to the A/A rules, a copy of which I am attaching below, an Analyst can be promoted to Associate if he/she falls under one of the criteria among several.  The one I believe I am eligible under states:

-  completed 2 years in the Program; have a performance rating of Excellent or above; and have either (1) an appropriate graduate degree or (2)  1 year of relevant commercial work experience prior to Enron

Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to look into this issue.  Thank you very much for your time and help.

To all:

The latest paper from Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren of the Cato Institute is very, very good. This is an excellent analysis and even goes into market microstructure. Nevertheless, no one bats a hundred. These two overlook the critical role that long-term markets (swaps and option structures) can (and I think, must) play in creating a new market regime.

Subject:	Direct Access 8/10/01

Below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding Direct Access.  We will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated. 

Summary:
Direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of California's 1996 deregulation law.  Under this concept, all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility.  The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve California's costly power crisis.  It will determine whether businesses, with residential customers, pay for the bulk of the state's future energy purchases. It also could determine whether Southern California Edison, the state's cash-strapped No. 2 utility, will avoid bankruptcy, and whether deregulation will survive in any form.

Big businesses, free-market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so-called ""direct access"".  Now, as the state prepares to sell $13.4 billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt, legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct-access escape route.  Regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system, the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long-term electricity contracts through 2021.  That would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the $43 billion in future power costs, a point that has enraged consumer groups.  Currently, only about 88,000 customers buy their energy through direct access (per CEC statistics), including about 10,000 large commercial/industrial customers, and about 78,000 residences.  Alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to California's primary utility suppliers (SoCal Ed., PG&E, SDG&E) earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the Legislature.  

California legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest Edison bailout plan, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley. Under the plan, the 3,600 largest businesses would agree to pay $3.1 billion of Edison's debts over 15 years.  In exchange, businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by 2003, but not without first paying an ""exit fee.""  The fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined, however, they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases.  It is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access, California's business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms.

To ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget, lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills, (one sponsored by Sen. Bowen and defeated in July, and a second by Assemblyman Dave Kelley,) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the Public Utilities Commission to block direct access.  The California PUC has thus far stayed a decision on the matter, but is expected to rule by August 23rd.

Complicating the issue is Wall Street.  The state's bankers, led by J.P Morgan, are nervous about selling as much as $13.4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses (currently the largest ratepayers in the state, after governments) find a way out of the system.  The bonds are meant to repay the state for $8.2 billion in power-buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs.  Business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills.  If businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers, that revenue stream would be in jeopardy.

Great. Richard is a very important internal customer. 
Also, please keep in mind that for power trading in the UK
and Europe winter is the most important season.

We should be thinking about ramping up resources by then.

Subject:	Discussion with Richard Lewis

Hi Vince

Just thought I would bring you up to speed on conversation last week with Richard Lewis.

Turns out I had already met him briefly way back at start of March!  He is very personable and was impressed with the daily briefing I give to UK Gas which he has overheard on several occasions.

He is very keen for me to provide a daily briefing for UK Power, similar in format to current briefing for UK Gas.

He introduced me to Simon Hastings who heads up UK Power Trading Desk (similar level to Peter Crilly in UK Gas) - I will be meeting with him later this week to discuss specific UK Power weather requirements.

Initially, due to workload at this end, I will provide them with the same package as UK Gas (i.e. 1 to 5 Day temperature outlook for UK) at around 8:15 am, but they are interested in getting 1 to 5 day outlook for precipitation and illumination (cloud cover) up and running - we can work towards spinning these up in the future.

Will be spinning up a daily briefing for Softs starting on Monday, and a daily briefing for Weather Derivatives starting Mid June/July.

Best regards,

Tony

Subject:	CFA prep questions

Hi Vince, 

I am sitting the CFA exam (Level I) on June 2.  In order for me to stay on track with my study schedule, it would be most helpful for me to take a number of days off prior to the exam.  I am wondering whether Enron has a paid-time off policy for individuals who are taking time out of the office to prepare for written professional exams.  In this effort, I am hoping to take the 2 days off prior to Memorial Day, as well as the 4 days after Memorial Day to study.  The spillover from working some weekends during the last few months (when curve demand was heavier, Mitra hadn't yet started, and GMM preparation) pushed back my schedule somewhat, and I'm hoping to make up for it in the days leading up to the actual exam date.  

I'd appreciate it if you let me know if there is such a policy to allow time off with pay for situations such as mine.  

Also, regarding reimbursement of my expenses associated with the CFA exam, will Enron (or ENA Research, now that I am out of the A/A program) reimburse me for my exam prep costs as well as incidental expenses (e.g. airfare to Chicago to take the CFA prep course (3 days) in early May, as I was out of town on a pre-planned vacation during the Houston session).

Thanks for your help and guidance.

                      Generators/ Power Marketers FERC Meeting Agenda Memo for January 16,  2002 
Introduction 
The Commission has set a very  light agenda for its first public meeting of 2002.  At next week's meeting,  the Commission will address only 20 electric items, in comparison to its last  meeting in which it addressed over 70.  Although a very short agenda, FERC  has chosen to address some very long-standing contentious issues, e.g. FERC's  jurisdictional authority to order public power and governmental entities to  provide transmission service to FERC-jurisdictional entities, phantom congestion  in California, remaining issues of contention over the ISO NE's installed  capacity program, issues contributing to the inadequacy of generation and  transmission infrastructure in the Northeast, and tets of FERC's authority  to waive certain limitations of PURPA to re-certify a Qualifying Facility.   
 
Commission Agenda: http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/sunshine.htm 
Infrastructure  Issues
E-1 Infrastructure  Discussion in the Northeast AD-02-6 - Commission  discussion on topics to be addressed at FERC's upcoming January 31, 2002  conference in New York City on ""Energy Infrastructure Adequacy in the  Northeast"". 
 
 
OATT Disputes
E-12  Souhwest Power Pool, Inc.   ER99-4392-001 - Order on several requests for rehearing of the  Commission's 12/17/99 order which directed SPP to make several modifications to  its OATT. In addition, another set of filers seek guidance of how to  recover costs for generator and transmission maintenance costs resulting from  SPP rescheduling planned maintenance outages. 
 
PURPA Challenges
E-5  American Ref-Fuel Company of Delaware  Valley, L.P.  QF87-492-003 - Order on American Ref-Fuel's  request for re-certifcation of its qualifying waste-fired power production  facility . This proceeding has been protested by a group that calls itself,  the PURPA Reform Group. It contends that FERC does not have the authority to  change the Public Utility Regulatory Policy  Act ( PURPA) policies on  a case-by-case basis and,  in this case, grant the petitioner waiver of  PURPA 's 80 MW limitation.  FERC and the applicant did,  however,  receive congressional and industry support for this  petition. 
 
Rehearing Requests
E-20  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.   v.  California Independent System Operator  EL01-89-001 - Order on CA ISO's request for  rehearing of the Commission's Sept. 28, 2001 order, which established settlement  procedures to resolve complaints of the CA ISO's continued problems with  ""phantom congestion."" 
E-19 ISO New England,  Inc.  EL00-62-037 - Order on several  requests for rehearing of FERC's September 28, 2001 order, which attempted to  resolve outstanding issues with implementation of the ISO-NE's  Installed Capacity program.
 
FERC Authority 
E-11 Public Service Co.  of  Colorado TX98-2-000 - Order on Public Service's dated request that  FERC order Western Area Power Administration and several G&T cooperatives to  provide it transmission service, pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power  Act.
 
E-9 Pinnacle West Capital  Corporation TX02-1-000 - Order on Pinnacle West's request  that FERC order an Arizona Electrical District to provide it transmission  service, pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power Act.

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

I thought you might just like to have this information: several people have been asking about our trading volumes and whether or not they have decreased significantly. According to the graphs in the attached spreadsheet, the only significant drop in EOL trading came on 09/11 and 09/12. In fact, the largest number of transactions on EOL was on 10/23, which is since many of our problems started.

Vince,

As I mentioned in my voice mail, Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody, a recent MBA grad from Rice, into his group.  However, when we were talking about this position, Mike compared Sara to Elena.  Elena's title is admin coordinator, and I know that Sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that Elena should also.  Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work.  

I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah's duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad.  If the latter is the case, we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66K).  Please advise.

Thanks,
Anne

Lexi-
 
For CEFER trustees, there is no financial commitment required to sponsor a practicum.  The only potential expense would be to cover travel expenses for the team if you want them to make their presentation in person to management in Houston.  The main commitment we need is a person who will define a project topic for the team and be available for periodic conference calls throughout the semester.  The project sponsor should help guide the team in their research, and provide any internal company data or other contacts within the company who may have information relevant to the topic.  If you feel that a non-disclosure agreement is necessary due the nature of the project topic, you may request that the students sign one.  Dr. Ronn is the faculty advisor for each team, so students use him as a point of reference as well.
 
Some potential benefits of sponsoring a practicum include:

Additional exposure to MBA students interested in pursuing careers in energy.  The project sponsor will get a close look at a handful of students in action (mostly 1st year MBA's), and can identify potential target recruits for internships or full-time hires later on. 
""Free"" research.  Depending on how you structure the project, the students' results and presentation should be useful to your organization.  For example, I did a practicum with El Paso last year, and we studied their use of Master Limited Partnerships as a vehicle for their midstream business.  We were able to research in depth some questions they wanted to answer but didn't have the time to do themselves.  Our research confirmed some of their ""hunches"", and management was very pleased with the results.

The level of interest in practicums among 1st year students is quite high compared to last year (over 40 students responded so far).  So, we would be excited to have Enron as a sponsor this year. (If you would like to sponsor more than 1 team, we would certainly welcome that as well!)
 
I have attached the original practicum document with some more details in case you do not have a copy.  Let me know if you have any other questions I can answer.
 
Thanks,
Stephen

Mr. Kaminski- 

I am an officer in the Energy Finance Group in the University of Texas MBA program, and I am in charge of coordinating our Energy Finance Practicum Program.  I would like to know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring one or more student teams in an energy finance practicum next semester.  I have attached a document with a description of the program, and details on what the level of commitment is for a sponsor (no financial commitment is required).  Sponsorships can only be given by the eight trustees of CEFER (the Center for Energy Finance Education & Research).  Dr. Ronn serves as a faculty advisor for each team.

Lexi Elliott suggested that you and Traci would be the appropriate people to contact for such a request.  Could you let me know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring a team next semester, and who my point of contact should be in the event that you would like to participate?  Feel free to contact me if you would like some more details on the program.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Hope your day is going well. Philip Merrill suggested I contact you
regarding a conference I'm organizing on Implementing the Commodities
Futures Modernization Act. The conference will include sections on Single
Stock Futures, Clearing and Trading Facilities. The latter section will
include a session on the new electronic exchanges and I would like to invite
Enron to speak on their electronic energy trading exchange.

The conference will take place September 20 - 21, 2001 at The Drake Hotel in
Chicago. The session will be in the afternoon on Thursday, September 20. I
expect the conference will draw 100 executives from broker dealers, futures
commissions merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators,
introducing brokers, investment banks, exchanges, and clearing firms.

The Institute for International Research (IIR) is the world's largest
international conference company with 120 different business units and 4,000
employees in 36 countries. Founded in 1973 by Irvine Laidlaw, the current
Chairman, IIR continues to provide unbiased, bleeding-edge business
information through our conferences, workshops, seminars, and the Internet.
For more information on IIR, please visit our website at
http://www.iirusa.com.

A draft agenda is attached for your review. Please note it is a work in
progress and I will be finalizing it over the next week. I welcome any
feedback on how to improve the program, as well as any speaker suggestions.

Thanks again for your assistance. I'll follow-up with you next week, but
please feel free to contact me in the interim with any questions.

Enjoy your weekend.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from Boston... In the last year, I've been associated with the
Neptune merchant transmission project... check it out at www.NeptuneRTS.com.
We filed with FERC last week and I'm sending you the Wall Street Journal and
Megawatt Daily articles on it.

Have you seen any good analytical work on merchant transmission? I'm in a
dialogue with Paul Joskow and others on this issue but as always would
appreciate your thoughts.

All the best,

Ed

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

Subject:	Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis

Hi Vince,

	Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
	The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
	The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Vasant

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights on the corn price protection approach.

Subject:	Market Forecasting Conference

Hi Vince,

It been awhile since we have spoken, hope all has been going great for
you.

I left a voice message on this conference subject with you.  We want to
invite you to speak at our conference.

Thought you might like to take a look at the preliminary agenda so I am
attaching that to this email.

This is the fourth year of our conference.  It has grown in quality and
attendance each year.  The conference is held at Skamania lodge, which
is about 45 minutes from the Portland airport.

Basically, we expect an attendance of about 70-80 individuals from the
US and Canada.  We get a broad spectrum of attendance both
geographically and functionally.  It is an excellent opportunity for
networking and building knowledge about electric markets.  All of the
presentations are very well attended.

We strive also for a broad spectrum of high quality speakers.  Many have
no relation with EPIS, we simply are looking for the best speakers we
can find.  We have a high respect for you and know that you would
greatly add to the value of our conference.  It has always been a
pleasure to work with you in the past.  For this conference, we would
consult with you to develop a speaking topic that would fit with your
desires and with our program.

As a speaker, your conference fees would be handled by us.  And the
conference fees include all meals except one dinner.  You would handle
the travel and hotel.

We also provide some opportunity for relaxation with a catered
reception/dinner at the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center, which
overlooks the gorge and is filled with great history and information
about the spectacular gorge, and on the second evening an informal/fun
golf tournament (included in the conference fees) for those who are
interested.

We hope that you would give this your consideration, and we look forward
to hearing from you.

Thanks

Please, let me know what you decide to do over the next few days.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:
I assume that Prof. Oren has sent to you an e-mail in which he  informed of our ongoing purpose of organizing an international conference on Ten  year of Electricity Deregulation and Restructuring. He attached a very  preliminary agenda as well with all the people and lectures committed  already.
I would like to formally invite you to come to Spain by  December 17-18 to give a lecture of around 45 minutes on the key  issues that operators and energy services and trading companies are confronting  in assessing the risk chain in the new deregulated environment business:  adequacy risks, trading risk management, capacity markets, etc.
Regarding budget and expenses, I can allocate $2.500,  plus a bonus should we break even, to cover your traveling and emoluments.  We will take care of the lodging as well.
 
Please feel free to contact me if you need further details. As  soon as we have some more formal description of the Conference and a first  definitive schedule I will send it to you.
 
Let me have your response whenever you are able to do  so.
 
Best regards.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Origination
On Friday, June 15, the Development Review Committee for Deerfield Beach, Florida, unanimously approved the 510 megawatt peaking power plant proposed for their city.  This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14.

Enron Industrial Markets
On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.  

In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.  

These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.

Dear Vince,

    I just wanted to thank you for inviting me to visit Enron last Friday and
for the generous amount of time you spent with me personally while I was
there.  I found our discussions both informative and stimulating.

    Vince, I was genuinely impressed by the caliber of the group you have
assembled at Enron.  Their individual and collective expertise is obvious;
and they were most generous in exchanging ideas and sharing opinions with me.

    If you or any of your people have, over the weekend, developed further
questions or thought of additional information that might be helpful, I'm
standing by.  I'm eager to continue our dialogue.


    Sincerely,

    Larry Thorne

Please note also that the teams entered must be coed, so we need Ladies as well as Gents.

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot

You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this ""extra"" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.

"FW: Overview of Investor Conference Call"," 
-----Original Message-----
From: Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman 
Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 9:29 PM
To: DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2
Subject: Overview of Investor Conference Call


Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Dear Vince,

I have attached the invoice for the workshop that Beth O'Sullivan and I
conducted for your group last month as well as a summary of the workshop
evaluation.  I am sorry for the delay, but we were waiting to receive more
of the workshop evaluations so that we could provide you a more complete

11 responses of the 17 attendees.

I will also send you a copy of this invoice in the mail and will be glad to
send you the actual evaluation forms completed by the attendees if you
would like to have them.

As mentioned in the attached, we enjoyed working with your group and hope
that you can see the difference the training made in the presentation
ability of the attendees.

If you have any questions about the attached invoice, please do not
hesitate to call me at 713-348-5394.

Again, thanks for bringing us in to conduct the workshop.  I sincerely hope
that you are well despite any changes taking place around you and that you
have a great Thanksgiving holiday.

Eric,

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/
interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
I think our participation may a bit higher.

Hi Shirley,

We're in Boston and are pretty much settled.  I'm wondering if you can help 
me wrap-up some details before school starts.  I have not yet received the 
final loan agreement papers from Enron.  I talked with Anne Labbe before I 
left, and again this week, and she's said that she expected legal to finish 
finalizing my papers, and I should have them by 8/10.  Have you heard 
anything about my agreement?  The registration fee for school is due next 
week, so I would like to have everything resolved pretty soon if possible.

Thanks for your help.

Vince,

Greetings.

1.  Per our communications earlier this year, you had agreed to participate
in a Feb. 22 panel discussion entitled ""Future of Energy Trading.""

We have now revised the format of the above Conference, so that our current
planning is this:  On 2/22, from 2 - 5 p.m., at the McCombs School of
Business, we will have a panel discussion that will focus on
""Enron/Andersen:  Causes, Consequences and Conclusions.""  We will invite
faculty, Energy Finance Group students, other students, other
practitioners, and possibly members of the press.

I write to inquire whether your earlier receptiveness to participating in a
panel discussion extends to this newly-defined topic.

2.  Alternatively, you had mentioned the possibility of coming to Austin in
early-to-mid Feb. to discuss matters with a smaller group.  I also seek to
discuss that matter with you.

I would like to call you this afternoon to discuss these two issues.  Best,
Ehud

		What's New at ERisk.com - 07 December 2001	


		
Weekly Review	In this week's round-up   of economic, banking and insurance industry news from an enterprise risk  management perspective: US stocks finally enjoy a tech-led rally; Enron's  bankruptcy opens up new questions on audit as banks count up their exposures;  the Fed reassures on systemic risk; Merrill Lynch settles with Unilever;  AIG's Greenberg warns on terrorism coverage; Equitas ups reserves to  cope with asbestos claims.	
Analysis 	 Rates  for property & casualty (P&C) insurance have hardened dramatically  since September 11, and terrorism coverage is likely to be excluded from  many policies from early next year. Is this the opportunity   that alternative risk transfer (ART) needs to take root in the market?  Or are potential clients still wary of applying capital markets techniques  to what have traditionally been seen as insurable risks? 	
iConference	Our  next iConference, ""Selecting and Evaluating Credit Risk Models"",  takes place on December 11 at 1200 Eastern Time (1700 GMT). Craig Friedman  and Robert Cangemi of Standard & Poor's will present a strategic view  of the main issues for senior managers and offer the latest thinking on  some quantitative pitfalls. Sponsored by ICICIresearchcentre.org ,  this free, hour-long event is essential for anyone charged with selecting  a credit risk methodology. Click here   to register.	
Feature	As  Enron's experience testifies, killer risks can slip through even a sophisticated  enterprise risk management programme. As Alan McNee finds in our latest  feature ,  ""Who Watches The Watchmen?"", tightening the net involves looking  again at the roles of risk management and internal audit.  Still available: ""Risk  Management in the Digital Age"" , by Rick Davis of DigitalRisk Advisors	
Bookstore	Our featured book   this month is ""The Chastening: Inside The Crisis that Rocked the Global  Financial System and Humbled the IMF"" by Paul Blustein. Washington  Post writer Blustein looks at the inner workings of the regulators of  the international monetary system during the 1997-8 financial crisis in  the Far East that later spread around the world. And it isn't pretty reading.   Still available: November's featured book ,  ""Operational Risk - Measurement and Modelling"", by Jack L.King,  and October's featured book ,  ""Fooled by Randomness"", by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"Re: CHARM","Jim,

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Subject:	General Observations during my London trip
Importance:	High

Hi,

	Below is a summary of my trip to London.  I can supply more details if you like.

	See you at 10:30 am.

Regards,
Iris






Mismatch of skills and resources
?	2-3 quants managed by many non-quant managers (lots of nepotism - more like the ""PG&E Alumni Club"")
?	Data team expanding - but no data
?	Head quant not a quant

Lots of problems with current version of the models
?	Models based on ECT traders' biased estimation of CDS prices - which later the traders admitted were wrong
?	Used less than 692 inaccurate CDS prices (made up by the traders) to estimate the CDS prices for 10,000 names on the EC website 
?	Mapping of ratings onto numerical values (no hard-core analysis of mapping nor sensitivity analysis of parameters)
?	Confidence intervals ""made up by traders"" (no hard-core analysis of mapping nor sensitivity analysis of parameters)
?	Quants confess that there are major flaws in their modeling process 
?	Ben admitted to fudging models - due to time pressure from traders and unrealistic deadlines set by non-quant managers who simply do not understand the technical issues and data requirements.  More specifically, the quants are very concerned about the July 30th deadline to price 1000 firm and 4000 indicative names based on the current versions of their models (which the quants thought they were initially developing as prototypes).
?	On 5/10/01 one of the traders (Nick) informed the quants that the current version of the asset swap model is wrong.
?	Each morning a trader (Ilyan) overwrites the results from the FMC models.  Quants also admit to problems in this model.

Large Marketing Budget and Massive Marketing Effort
?	New marketers constantly being hired.
?	They are beginning to attend tons of events (New York, Chicago, Seattle, etc.).
?	In one on one conversations with these marketers they seem to be very nice folks but don't seem to have a clue about the products they are hired to market, the potential risk exposures, legal and regulatory issues concerning their products, etc.  (I thought that Enron prides itself on looking more and more like an investment bank.  Derivatives marketers at investment banks are quite savvy - they have securities licenses, know their products, many of them are former quants, structurers, traders, etc.  EC might want to take note.)

Extremely unprofessional behavior on trading floor!!!!!
?	Verbal & physical assaults - especially directed toward individuals that question the current EC strategy and process.

"RE: Joao Neves","Rita,

I have postponed all the hiring decisions till late August - early September.
We can revisit Joao's case at this point. We shall have better information about the 
space in the new building we can count on and the time of the move.

We appreciate Joao interest in Enron.

Thought this might be a better form of communication since it has been so
difficult for us to communicate via telephone.

As I had mentioned this morning, Joao Neves is quite interested in joining
your team and I would like to ask you, if you feel it appropriate at this
time, for Joao to re-visit you and your team to discuss, possibly more in
depth issues.

Please advise.

Subject:	Quanto Swap

Vince:
Sorry about the delay. Here is the presentation and the spreadsheet for the quanto swap valuation. 

1) The presentation shows the pricing for a particular day of the season. The valuation for the whole season is simply the sum of the prices for individual days.  
2) Notice that as we blend the correlations the covariance term is simply dependent on the time that there is a forecast for HDDs.
3) The spreadsheet shows the hedging for both gas and weather. We need to start long on gas and hold this position up to the point where weather volatility kicks in. Notice that weather variance starts high and declines to maturity reflecting the presence of autocorrelation among past HDDs.
4) It is easy to produce an option model that pays out MAX(P*(D-K),0).

At this moment I and Claudio from the weather desk are talking to gas traders to resolve how to operate the hedging on gas (no problems so far). We are both believrs that this is a great product. If Enron does not lunch it someone else will do it. You may see it as a syntetic storage. 

I will be polishing the documentation and geting into the development of the option model as soon as I finish other assignments. 

  

Thanks.

Brian,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him with no trouble at all.

Thanks,
Anne

Britt,

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Vince

Hi Vince,
Just a note to say I hope that you and the other good people I have met over the past couple of years are able to overcome the difficulties you are currently facing at Enron.  As you know we are continuing to market our GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System to the industry and have done pretty well in that effort.  In fact, we are doing well enough that our users are in need of good analysts who could quickly learn our system and operate it for their companies.  There are three or four openings in Houstonand several others in other cities in the U.S.  If you can think of anyone who has worked for you who would be both capable and interested in this kind of application, I would be happy to forward their names and information to the people who are looking.
Again, good luck in whatever you choose to do, please stay in touch, and thanks for your help.

Generators/Power Marketers December 19  FERC Post-Meeting Memo
 
Introduction  
At the last Commission meeting of the year, FERC approved  the first RTO in the Midwest and issued some critical orders on RTO development,  announced plans to defer action and the effects of its November market power  orders, modified mitigation measures for the Western Systems Coordinating  Council, reaffirmed price mitigation measures for the California ISO markets,  and challenged industry to develop a ""single"" industry consensus organization by  March 15, 2002 to be the standards-setting body for commercial business and  communications protocol standards. 
To that end , the Alliance of  Energy Suppliers and EEI encourages industry to actively participate in its  national meetings being held in four regions of the country to advance the  development of principles for which to form this organization. The  first of the four regional meetings will be held on January 15, 2002 in  Phoenix, AZ with the remaining meeting in Cincinnati, OH, New  York City, and Atlanta, GA .  An e-mail with all of the necessary  logistical information has been circulated.  If you are interested in  attending or sending a company representative and did not receive the earlier  e-mail, please let us know. 
In addition, FERC announced  a series of technical conferences on standard market design and structure,  market based rate /market power, and energy infrastructure. 
 
If you would like copies of any orders, please do not hesitate to  contact us.
Midwest ISO Receives FERC's  Approval as an RTO 
In a series of inter-related RTO  decisions, FERC approved the nations first RTO, granting the Midwest ISOs  proposal to become an RTO, while rejecting a similar plan from the Alliance  Companies to form the Alliance RTO. In reversing prior policy, FERC concluded  that the ARTO proposal lacked sufficient scope and size to exist as a  stand-alone RTO and told the Alliance Companies to explore how their business  plan can be accommodated within the [MISO] structure. Allowing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best solution that would compromise customers'  interests, FERC stated. 
In related developments, FERC also approved  International Transmission Company's request to transfer operational control of  its transmission facilities to MISO and accepted an agreement between MISO and  International Transmission that would allow the company to be an independent  transmission company that would share certain RTO functions with MISO. Finally,  in a related docket FERC granted in part National Grids request for a  declaratory order that it is not a market participant, but dismissed the  Alliance Companies business plan without prejudice as unneeded given the other  Alliance order, thus nullifying Grids proposal to manage ARTO. (More  detailed RTO summary provided below) 
FERC Delays Implementation of New Market Power Rules  
FERC announced that it would delay the effects of its November 20 market  power orders. In FERC's December 19 order, it recognized the Alliance of  Energy Suppliers' filing requesting FERC to vacate or stay the effects  of its market power orders and initiate a rulemaking proceeding to allow for  comments by affected industry participants, as basis for its change in policy  action. We should claim this as a victory--for FERC has announced an upcoming  technical conference to discuss said orders and allow industry to voice its  concerns over the implications of such measures on the competitive wholesale  markets. Although a date for this technical conference has not been announced,  Chairman Wood said that details of the conference will be released in a  notational order. FERC has also delayed implementation of certain aspects of the  new Supply Margin Assessment (SMA) market power screen test.  
FERC Sets Schedule for Electric Market Design;  Industry Told to Select Wholesale Market Standards Body or FERC Will Do  So. 
FERC outlined a schedule for a rulemaking in the  Electric Market Design docket and announced the release of a staff white paper  to serve as a strawman piece for continued collaboration with interested parties  on standardized electric market design. FERC stated it expected to host industry  workshops in early 2002, tentatively set for January 22 -25 and February 4- 8,  to further develop ideas on market standardization and issue a NOPR in March  2002. The NOPR would be followed by additional workshops in April and May to  discuss NOPR inclusions and workshop developments. Written comments on the NOPR  and workshop progress will also be due in May. A final rule is expected to be  issued in July 2002. Although FERC staff recognized that this was a very  ambitious schedule, the FERC presenter said they wanted to ""get done before  summer break"" (2002). 
Meanwhile, FERC said, interested parties should  evaluate NAESB, NERC and alternative proposals for an organization to develop  wholesale electric industry business practice and communication standards, and  agree on a single consensus, industry-wide organization to develop these  standards by March 15, 2002. The Order indicated that should industry not agree  on a single organization by that date, FERC would either choose an organization  or institute a proceeding to develop the necessary standards.  
Commissioner Brownell reiterated her dismay and disbelief with  industry's lag in progress: ""[l]et's get this done."".. "" I can't believe we're  still debating the ""who"". The other three Commissioners indicated their general  support for the Order. Commissioner Breathitt believes that this ANOPR process  is working well because it ""gives industry something to coalesce around.""  Breathitt was also in favor of industry answering the question of how much  standardization do we need and how much do we need to leave to creativity and  innovation?  Chairman Wood concluded his remarks, saying, ""[t]he GIGA-NOPR  is on its way."" 
The staff white paper covering these issues is available  from the FERC website at: http://www.ferc.gov/electric/rto/mrkt-strct-comments/mrkt-strct-concept.PDF   . 
FERC Largely Reaffirms Prior Western  Market Price Mitigation Orders, Modifies Price Cap to Account for NW Winter  Peaking Concerns 
In a broad rehearing order that addresses a  wide range of issues related to California and the western energy markets, FERC  generally denied rehearing requests and reaffirmed earlier decisions on pricing  and price mitigation measures. The order addresses rehearing and clarification  requests for the Commission's August 23, November 1, December 8 and December 15,  2000 orders along with its March 9, June 19, and July 25, 2001 refund and price  mitigation orders. Among adjustments made to previous orders, FERC modified the  scope of price mitigation and must-offer requirements, especially as applied to  governmental sellers and cooperatives, eliminated the underscheduling penalty  established in the December 15 Order, and provided an opportunity for certain  entities to submit evidence that the refund methodology results in a revenue  shortfall. FERC also modified and provided clarifications on setting of the  mitigated market-clearing price. 
In particular, FERC clarified that:  
government sellers and cooperatives are excluded from price mitigation as  its applies to bilateral transactions outside the ISO spot market and also  with the must-run requirement outside of California; 
units operating outside of California may set the mitigated  market-clearing price; 
the mitigated market-clearing price is to be set by the proxy price of the  last unit dispatched, rather than the lower of the proxy price or the actual  bid of the marginal unit; 
and generators subject to the must-offer requirement should be able to  recover their costs for complying with the ISO's instructions to keep their  units at minimum load status, and that the ISO must pay these costs,  regardless of whether the ISO buys the power. 

Modification to Western-Wide Price Mitigation  Measures 
In a separate order, FERC responded to industry  recommendation from its October 29 technical conference and modified the price  mitigation methodology for spot market transactions for the west-wide market for  the winter season. FERC stated that changes would support continued price  stability and balance in the western markets. The changes were called for in  part, FERC said, since the area the California ISO serves is a summer peaking  system and a large portion of the 11-state Western Systems Coordinating Council,  consists of winter peaking systems. The changes extend from the date of the  order through April 30, 2002, at which time the summer mitigation measures will  be reinstated. Most notably, the new cap levels take into account fluctuation in  natural gas prices. 
Modifications to previous mitigation measures  are;
raises cap level from $98 to $108
continues to apply 10 percent credit worthiness adder
sets February 2002 as date that final outstanding payments be made to  Western sellers of power

FERC's objective through these order was to allow  FERC and affected parties in the West to move forward on calculating  any refunds owed and to provide greater rate certainty and stability to the  market, according to the commissioners. 
More information on the  California and western market changes is available in FERC's press release:  http://www.ferc.gov/news/pressreleases/calif1-dec192001.PDF   and the full order: http://www.ferc.gov/electric/bulkpower/el00-95-001-12-19-01.PDF   , both available in ""pdf"" format from FERC's website.  
RTO Developments  
MISO Approved As Nations First RTO  
In approving MISOs RTO application as the nations first RTO, FERC  said that it complies with the vision and requirements of Order No. 2000, in  particular the requirement that an RTO be of sufficient scope. FERC cited  favorably MISOs announced merger with the Southwest Power Pool and said that it  was particularly encouraged by MISO's planned accommodation of flexible business  plans and innovation as well as its considerable geographic span. 
For the most part, FERC found that MISO satisfied the four characteristics  for an RTO independence, scope and configuration, operational authority, and  short-term reliability, as well as key functions. FERC did, however, direct MISO  to submit a number of revisions. FERC found MISO's independence satisfactory in  most respects, but said that transmission owners cannot be permitted to have  veto privileges on filings that affect pricing. FERC conditioned MISO's RTO  status on modification of the MISO Agreement to give it the authority to propose  rates, terms and conditions of transmission service under the MISO tariff. On  the scope and regional configuration characteristic, FERC told MISO to present  recommendations within 60 days addressing the question of its eastern seam prior  to the integration of the Alliance Companies into MISO. FERC also indicated that  MISO should participate in its recently announced rulemaking proceeding to  standardize market design rules. However, FERC said, MISO should also address  certain congestion management issues prior to implementation of standardized  market rules. FERC also directed additional changes to ensure the independence  of the market monitor and required modification of the planning framework to  reflect that it will consider all market perspectives and to accommodate  third-party investment, construction and ownership of transmission  facilities.
 
Alliance Companies Told to Work Under MISO; FERC Finds  IRCA Efforts Insufficient 
Citing in part strong support from a majority of the Midwest state  regulators for a single Midwest RTO and Alliance RTO (ARTO)s failure to achieve  the necessary close coordination with MISO, FERC concluded that the ARTO lacked  sufficient scope to exist as a stand-alone RTO. FERC expressed confidence,  however, that the Alliance Companies' desire to be a viable, for-profit  transmission business can be accommodated under the MISO Appendix I structure.  FERC emphasized the importance of fostering RTO development designed to provide  a seamless and robust market for millions of customers. Allowing two RTOs in the  Midwest would be a second-best solution that would compromise customers'  interests, concluded FERC. The Commission ordered the Alliance Companies to file  a status report on their efforts to join MISO within 60 days. In the Order, FERC  acknowledged the significant time and expense incurred by the Alliance Companies  to date, adding that it would consider proposals for recovery of all prudently  incurred costs. 
 
International Transmission Approved As ITC Under  MISO
In a related order, FERC said that International Transmission Company  (International Transmission), a subsidiary of DTE Energy, could join the new RTO  as an independent transmission company that will be able to pursue innovative  business strategies. International Transmission proposes to maintain and develop  transmission while turning over to the RTO such functions as congestion  management and curtailments, tariff administration, and security coordination.  DTE Energy has indicated its intention to sell International Transmission to a  third party. FERC gave preliminarily approval for the divestiture of the  transmission facilities. FERC, however, deferred ruling on several contested  RTO/transco function issues until International Transmission becomes truly  independent.
 
National Grid Meets Independence Criterion, as FERC  Dismisses Alliance Companies ARTO Business Plan
FERC granted in part and deferred in part a National Grid proposal to  manage the RTO transmission system. FERC found that National Grid is not a  market participant by virtue of its retail obligations in New York and New  England. FERC directed the Alliance Companies to explore how their business  plan, including National Grid's proposal, could be accommodated within the MISO  RTO. FERC expressed its intent to provide more guidance on this matter in future  proceedings.
 
General Discussion
Signaling a deference to Midwestern state commissions, Chairman Wood said,  ""[w]e have brought order out of an array of various and sundry efforts in the  middle of the country. . . . Its a good Christmas gift to the nation. Wood  cautioned that the orders findings are based on what best serves the public  interest in the Midwest, and that FERCs actions should not be construed to  prejudge other types of RTOs in other parts of the country, including a  structure in which a for-profit transmission company could be an umbrella RTO.  For her part, Commissioner Breathitt dissented on the Alliance Order, stating  that after the Alliance Companies have already spent over $75 million in  start-up costs and its plans were given tentative approval by FERC over the past  two and a half years, she saw no reason to abruptly change direction and deny  Alliance Companies an opportunity to implement their business model. The  Commission has not done all it could or should do to allow Alliance to develop,  Breathitt said.  Addressing the near-unanimous support among Midwest  regulators for a single Midwest RTO, Commissioner Massey stated, we are heeding  that advice and moving forward accordingly. For his part, the Alliance Order did  not represent a change of position, he said, noting that he has long favored  forcing a consolidation of the two RTO proposals. Additional details on these  orders can be found in the FERC press release which is available from FERCs  website at: http://www.ferc.gov/news/pressreleases/mwestxpressrel.PDF   . 
 
PJM - PJM West Denied on a Procedural  Basis 
Chairman Wood, in meeting discussion stated that the  rejection was on a procedural issue only, with a delay required only because of  provisions pending in other dockets. In a two-page letter order, FERC rejected  the request of PJM and PJM West to integrate, but Chairman Wood assured the  parties that FERC remained committed to the expansion effort and wants to see it  move forward very quickly. All indications are that once the other provisions  have been addressed, FERC would be ready to move forward on the PJM West effort.  
FERC Directs PJM To amend Tariffs to Include New  Oversight Measures 
FERC terminated its investigation into allegations that PECO Energy Company  had operated its transmission system in a manner that illegally advantaged a  corporate affiliate. FERC staff indicated that the record in the proceeding did  not establish a violation of the Federal Power Act or FERC's Standards of  Conduct sufficient to warrant further enforcement proceedings and that further  investigations into the matter were not warranted or necessary. Simultaneously,  FERC accepted a report from PJM outlining a series of improvements to its  current procedures for reporting of transmission outages and the rating of  transmission facilities. FERC directed PJM to file amendments to its tariffs to  reflect the new procedures. Commenting on the swift resolution of the matter,  Chairman Wood noted the importance of lifting the cloud of an investigation  promptly when the evidence warrants it. 
Staff  Reports High Cost of Congestion; Need RTO Congestion Management, More  Investment 
A presentation of a FERC staff report on electric  transmission constraints detailed the high costs of congestion and suggested  that building more transmission would likely lower overall consumer costs. The  report, which FERC staff acknowledged suffered from certain data limitations,  found that bottlenecks in the transmission system cost consumers more than $1  billion over the past two summers. The report also demonstrates the need for  strong congestion management systems at RTOs, FERC staff said. FERC  commissioners commended staff on the presentation and seemed supportive of the  conclusion that building additional infrastructure would bring benefits to  energy consumers. FERC staff also noted that a parallel DOE National Grid Study  should be completed and released before the end of the year. 
The staff  presentation is available in MS PowerPoint on the FERC ""Discussion Papers"" page  at: http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/Discussion_papers.htm   . 
Additional Commission  Action 
FERC Issues Accounting NOPR  with Question to Industry 
FERC issued an accounting NOPR  (Docket No. RM02-3) seeking comment on whether to require unregulated energy  marketers and traders to disclose holdings in derivative financial contracts  used to limit risks of volatile price swings in energy purchases and sales.  Chairman Wood said he looks to industry to answer the question and tell FERC  that the current exemption and blanket waivers and authorizations should remain  or not. Commissioner Breathitt pointed out that the current entities that must  comply with reporting requirements of derivative activity are not major players  in the derivative markets, but the open-ended question, if answered in the  affirmative, would place burdensome requirements on a sector of the market, i.e  power marketers, that most delve in that arena. Chairman Wood said that he might  be in agreement with possible responses from industry that say that ""maybe these  processes are for another agency to do, e.g. SEC, CFTC, etc. ."" 
Separately, the NOPR proposes changes to the Uniform System of Accounts  (USA) to record transactions required under Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB) Statement 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity  Securities, FASB Statement 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, and Statement  133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The NOPR also  proposes changes in the annual reports to the Commission, including the Form 1,  to conform to recent actions by FASB to tighten disclosure rules. The proposal  follows up Commission guidance issued in August 2001 for using the existing USA  for recording transactions covered by these FASB Statements. 
All four  commissioners endorsed the NOPR. Chairman Wood said the new rules would focus  more on providing transparency to investors than broadening FERC's regulatory  authority. Commissioner Breathitt commented that the new rule would seek to  collect annual data, not give FERC the ability to ""actively monitor"" the  complicated transactions. ""We would be obtaining a yearly snapshot of derivative  positions,"" Breathitt said. ""I think this is a good step.""  
FERC Staff Provides Update on Development  of Standardized Interconnection Policy 
FERC staff reviewed  the process and progress of the collaborative efforts to develop a standardized  generation interconnection policy. While interconnection documents were filed on  December 14th as required by the ANOPR, participants noted that the documents  remain a work in progress. Participants had requested, and FERC granted on  December 14, an extension of time to file the consensus documents to January 11  and to January 25 to file final comments in the docket. The collaborative  process remains on schedule to take up the ""money side"" of the issue in April  2002. 
Technical Conference On Energy  Infrastructure in the Northeast 
FERC  will hold a conference in Energy Infrastructure issues in the Northeastern  states on Thursday, January 31, 2002 at the Helmsley Park Lane Hotel in New  York City, New York.

"RE: Spring 2001 Energy Finance Conference Participation by  Jeffrey  K. Skilling","Sheridan,

I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call 
about this. I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation 
study we discussed at San Antonio. Mark Ruane whom you met, moved on
to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study.
Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision making
inside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area,
regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what we
already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount
rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential
values.

It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling. It would
also help if you could write a formal letter to him.

Dear Vince:

That is great news that Jeffrey Skilling will be speaking at our
conference.  By getting Skillings involvement we should be able to increase
the quality of the conference by at least a few notches.

By the way, Shirley may have mentioned to you that I somehow received two
checks for the work I did last spring.  I went off to Hong Kong this summer
and didn't follow up on this other than to mention it to Shirley before I
left. (I just got back last Friday.) Shirley left me a phone message to
mail the check back to her.  If you can email Shirley's last name and
mailing address to me I'll send her the check.  Also, if you are interested
in having me do some work on the valuation issues we discussed at the Texas
Finance Festival please let me know.

One more thing:  The university that I'm affliliated with in Hong Kong
(HKUST) just hired a new president, Paul Chu, who is from Houston and has
some sort of relationship with Ken Lay.  The Dean at the HKUST business
school mentioned that Paul Chu was meeting with Ken Lay this summer and
would discuss possible avenues of collaboration.  If you can think of
anything that you would be interested in let me know and I can discuss it
with the Dean.

I hope you are having a great summer and look forward to seeing you when
you come to Austin this fall for our energy finance class and in February
for the conference.

Dear Vince,

I am curious whether you are familiar with the attached Darden school case
on Enron... FYI.

John Martin and I would really like to try to interest you in coming to
campus sometime this fall to present a faculty seminar.  Selfishly, I would
also like to try arrange such a visit so that I can have you present to my
risk management class.  I called Shirley Crenshaw today, and she mentioned
that you were on your way back from Poland, so I hope we'll be able to talk
soon about the possibility of a visit this fall.  The best number for
reaching me is 512-751-3709.

Thanks,

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

Milly:  I have been asked to contact you to determine the status of the Permanent Residency application for Mr. Krishnarao.

On checking an old file for Mr. Krishnarao, I see that you started his Green Card application, based on Outstanding Researcher, in November, 1995.  There are also copies of the I-765 in the file, which I assume means that Mr. Krishnarao is already in the Adjustment of Status stage of the process?

I would appreciate you letting myself and Michelle Cash know where we are with the application at this time?  Hopefully, we are very close to completion! 

Many thanks

Subject:	No deal - Time to move !

All, 

After very serious consideration and having the experience of the first quarter,  I have decided the following:

1) Personally, I am starting the building of the public model beginning of June. I will follow a different methodological approach than the rest of the team but we are going to have the same common target for the 15th of July deadline.

2) The first suite of models will be ready beginning of July.

3) During implementation, I will be reporting to Scott Salmon and I am prepared to accept feedback on modelling (technical issues) from the following people (strictly): Iris Mack, Steve Leppard, Jagjit Dhaliwal, Slava Danilov, Vasant Shanbhogue, Bryan Seyfried, Amitava Dhar, Vince J Kaminski (The order of the names is random).  

4) Scott Salmon will communicate with the traders to make sure that we meet their requirements.

5) The traders should have all the time they need to assess the performance of the models and provide their valuable feedback. 

6) Extension of the models will be a continuous process (More data, more models).

7) Personally, I consider it absolutely beneficial  if I work closely with Houston and London Research from now on, so we can make sure that we do not miss anything going forward. If necessary, I am prepared to come to Houston and discuss technical issues about models.

8) If I have any problems to proceed with the current plan, I am going to ask for rotation as soon as possible. If this is not possible, I am going to leave the company immediately.
 
9) For those who invited me in the past in private rooms and asked me to slow down, I have to tell them that if this happens again I am going to proceed with an official complaint.

I am really sorry if I am being a bit agressive here, but I am sure that this the last chance for many of us. 

That's for now -

Best Regards,

g.

Subject:	RE: Models and Data from the Loan Pricing Corporation (A Reuters Company)



Hi,

	Today I met with John Dowling - a Vice President  of the Loan Pricing Corporation (LPC) .  LPC may present another potential set of options for ECT's data and/or public and private firm models needs.

	More specifically, John stated that LPC offers the following products/services:
	
?	A US data base - archives date back to 1988.  This database has various fields describing default and nondefault loans, etc.
?	A public and private firm model (both) for an annual subscription rate of $75,000.  These models estimate PDs for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.
?	The firm is beginning to collect data in European countries.


	John will be sending us further details about the analytical techniques used to develop their public and private firm models.  In addition, he will send us information on the various fields used in their database.



Regards,
Iris

Our MBA for Executives Program is not included in the recent Financial Times

1998. Our first EMBA class graduated in 2000.

Dean Gil Whitaker was featured in the global business edition of the October
29 issue of Time magazine where he was identified as a ""World Beater: People
to Watch in International Business."" Whitaker was chosen for his efforts to
diversify the school and pictured with a number of black, Hispanic and women
students. The entire article and photos will be posted on the website soon.

John Campbell, Chief Executive Officer of H-E-B's Central Market, will be
the Dean's Lecture Series featured speaker Wednesday, November 28, from 9:45

checker at H-E-B 30 years ago, led the way to create the premier fresh-food
emporium for people who love food. After years of witnessing customers armed
with coolers driving hundreds of miles to the first Austin location, H-E-B
has expanded the Central Market concept with an additional store in Austin,
one in San Antonio, and another in Houston, which opened May 2001.

Thanks for letting me know. We regret that Vince Kaminski will not be able
to make it, but I appreciate that there can always be unforeseen
circumstances like this. I assume that he will not be able to attend the
workshop, either - could you confirm this?

Thank you for providing a replacement - I am looking forward to meeting Mr
Lu in Paris. We will need his presentation tomorrow by 12, as the van will
leave at 1 to go to Paris.

Unfortunately, Vince Kaminski will not be able to attend the conference
in Paris next week due to unforseen circumstances here at Enron Houston.
He will be sending Dr. Zimin Lu, Director, Enron Research to replace
him.

I will be sending Zimin's presentation to our London Office and they
will get the copies to you sometime on Friday.  The Enron London Admin.
who is handling this for us is Karin Ahamer and her phone number is

I will forward your original email attachments with the changes later

Shirley,

Thank you for letting me know.

Would you send the copies from the US or from your London office (which
is
just across the road from ours)? If you could get them to copy the
presentation, that would be brilliant. If not, I think it is too
complicated
and too expensive for you to send them from the US. I would then try and
take care of the copying myself (but would prefer not to, as it the run
up
to the conference is fairly frantic as it is...).

Thank you for your help!

Kind Regards,

Angelika Staude

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am a student in a Master's programme in Mathematical Finance due to graduate in August. My intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative capacity in the
 Power markets and to this end, I am including my resume  in the hope that I might be considered for any available position in your risk
 management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills.

I have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but I am unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by your associate programme. If this is not the case, any help in seeing that my resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated.

 Yours sincerely,


 Ian McCracken

I have never had a chance to formally meet you but many people have said that you would be a wonderful person to talk to seek advice from.  I have a couple of directions that I am considering for careers right now (in risk management) and it would mean a lot to me to be able to sit down with you for a little bit to get your perspective.  Is there anyway I could buy you coffee or lunch sometime over the week or so?

Enclosed is information on textual mining and expert systems I spoke to you about in the lobby.  

EDS is currently providing commercial applications using experts systems and textual mining to derive value for our customers.  The presentation below has two examples of current applications.  It seems to me that there a multiple applications for this type of program within Enron which would have short payback periods.

Please let me know if you wish to investigate further.

Prof. Bala Dharan delivers a special lecture on ""The Enron Meltdown:  Was it an Accounting Failure, A Business Failure or a Regulatory Failure? What Can We Learn?"" from 7 to 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, January 31, at McMurtry Auditorium in Duncan Hall. 
 
Dharan will discuss various issues and address these questions: Were there red flags? Could we have spotted problems last year? Were there problems with the application of accounting standards or with the standards themselves? What were the accounting issues with SPEs and related parties? What can we learn from this sad event that has destroyed $80 billion and robbed thousands of employees of their jobs and life savings? 
 
We are now opening registration up to faculty, staff and students for free on a space available basis.  To register, visit http:// jonesgsm.rice.edu/jonesgsm/EE_Special_Events.asp   and make sure to put Faculty, Staff or Student in the ""Title"" line in order to receive the complimentary registration.  You must register to be admitted.  It does not matter whether the registration defaults to show payment by check or credit card, since you will not be charged.  See you there!

Please send this note to all identified participants in the Transmission Round Table-

To all Transmission Round Table participants:

Please think about this proposed project and keep involved with suggestions and information as you receive such.  Be prepared to discuss proposal at the next ""Round Table"" and offer remarks via e-mail to any appropriate Enron person, but particulars to Walter Coffer.

""Current Transmission Project""

Initial concept of Mandate and Plan of Action

1) Pinpoint restrictions in the Transmission system and then develop a strategy for profiting by mitigation or other actions.  

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.

2) Use our ""Transmission Round Table"" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.

Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.

Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.

3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.

4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)

5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.

6) Go to work now!

Maureen,

Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (August Board meeting) one more time before I forward it to you.  He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation (CPI,PPI, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.  Typically, we receive both FX and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.  I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.

For now, this is the list of countries for which  we will  probably need the FX and/or inflation curves.  I will send the specifics per Andre later today.

India 
Philippines
Bolivia
Jamaica
Guatemala
Venezuela
Columbia
Puerto Rico	CPI only (I need historical inflation data, as well)
Panama
Brazil		we have current data already
China		we have current data already
Euro		inflation only

I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting/IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already.

Thanks!

Cindy

Vincent,
Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like
quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has
done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

  Contact information:

Thanks,

Today's focus: Super-secret Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

Network Associates is teaming up with the National Security Agency,
the government's top electronic cryptography and spying institution,
to help the agency fine-tune its highly secure version of Linux. The
goal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside
attacks.

Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development
by the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more
secure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from
software vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security
division of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the
Linux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or
PC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating
system. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off
""buffer overrun"" and ""format string"" attacks, which take advantage of
loose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating
system and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed ""Lion"" was recently
identified as using this method to hack Linux servers.

NSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses
in the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux
project to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type
Enforcement protects the operating system and applications by
segmenting them into security ""domains"" with specifications on what
types of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this
could be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an
application, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with
VMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for
allowing users with different security access to work on the same
server.

The good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives
is that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once
finished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include
SELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more
bulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.

"Pricing of restriction on Enron stock","Ron,

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the Enron's point of view.


Please, let us know if this is required.

Subject:  KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

"Analytical help with the Dhabol Project","Stan,

Given the recent developments related to the DPC project, I would like to
offer the help of my group in providing analytical support in evaluating different options
that are open to us.

One member of my group, Sandeep Kohli, worked for years for DPC
in Mumbai and has not only good understanding of all the related contracts,
but also excellent relationships with the major stakeholders, partners and regulatory authorities.
He has also excellent analytical skills. His recent project was related to evaluation
of the potential for developing power markets around Maharashtra, to improve
economic viability of the DPC project (Dec 2000 - February 2001) - a presentation
is attached.

Please, feel free to ask Jim Hughes about Sandeep's skills and dedication to the company.

Dear Vince,

I tried to call but your phone was busy. I'm an unofficial advisor to the
White House energy team and they've asked me if Enron's bankruptcy presents
a potential systemic risk. I told them I did not think so.

This is FYI only... as I am unencumbered by the facts, it was only a
judgment call on my part.

Feel free to call me at 781 245 2036.

Best of luck... we're thinking of you and wish for the very best.

I regret to inform that I am terminating my job with Enron today 12/06/2001. Despite the later events I had a great time working with everyone in this company. More particularly, I will miss a lot of the excitement and learning opportunities that The Research propitiated in this last 3 years.

I will be pursuing new opportunities in a different company and as soon as I settle I will inform my new contact info. I will still be residing here in Houston I and I am looking forward to continuing nurturing the friendship we developed throughout these years.

Many thanks.

I don't know if it makes a difference now, but I want to let you know where I'm at, at this point.  My doctors visit yesterday confirmed that the blockage has returned and some action is recommended to try and correct it.  The problem is that actions short of a by-pass leave a 40% chance of a second recurrence.  A significantly reduced work schedule seems an important part of any long term solution.
 
As a result, Ann and I plan to return to Michigan no later than February where I would take a few months to recover my health.  Part time work, at best, may then be an option for me.
 
As I expect you will have to eliminate many research positions, I would prefer to be included in the first wave.
 
I want to thank you for the opportunity to work in your group for the last year and a half.  I have enjoyed the work and the tremendous learning opportunity.  The collegial atmosphere and the broad range of expertise you have assembled made it a delight to come to work each day.  All of us have gained from the time we spent at Enron.
 
I've chosen this e-mail because I expect you will be extremely busy for the next few days.  I would be happy to talk more if you like.
 
Bob

A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.

He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice to help you with
any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding
our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support 
of other members of my group with skills in different areas.

Gary - 

Thank you for the referral.  Obviously, this individual is very intelligent and highly skilled - but I do not see a fit for th e analyst/associate program.  

I will have my group send a letter to him indicating our decision not to bring him in for interviews for the pool.  

I did have one suggestion for you though.  You may want to pass his resume by Vince Kaminski for his review.  Vince has specialized needs and this candidate may be better suited for his group.

Thanks again,

Call 800-424-2908 today to  order your own Survival Guide   By the time you finish  reading this management report, you'll have gained a working understanding  of power market risk-management concepts and practices.   Risk management is a  structured discipline that uses well-defined policies and procedures to  mitigate a company's credit, market, or operational risks. It's a way of  looking at an unstable factor, such as fluctuating fuel prices, and  finding ways to offset the risk of that instability. Our Survival Guide  will give you the tools you need to make risk management an integral part  of your power market business. You'll discover:   [IMAGE]       How to protect revenue  streams for the future.               [IMAGE]       What market leaders,  such as Koch Energy Trading and Enron, are  doing.               [IMAGE]       Ways to incorporate  risk-management operations into your business  strategy.               [IMAGE]       How to better evaluate  and manage consultants' risk-management services, such as those  offered by Risk Advisory or SAVA Risk  Management.               [IMAGE]       Workable strategies  for monitoring and assessing risk-management operations.     To corporate energy  managers, risk management may mean understanding the risks and variable  value of different commodities. Power market players need to run their  plants and structure contracts to ensure that they'll be able to service  debt and achieve a solid return. As new entrants join the power market,  bringing risk-management experience from other sectors, existing players  need to get up to speed quickly. The Survival Guide supplies exactly what  information these professionals need to get started.  ""Power Market Risk  Management: A Survival Guide"" focuses exclusively on risk management for  power markets.  Risk management isn't  gambling-it's business sense!

I have attached the final agenda for the EMF meeting next week.  All times remain the same.  The new agenda lists for each session a few speakers, who will make some comments to help stimulate the group's discussion.   The first session will focus upon key issues that we would like to learn more about.  The second session focuses more on what we have learned about gas supply and infrastructure, while the third session focuses more on gas markets and ties to electricity.    
I am looking forward to an interesting and productive meeting.

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed your talk (and dinner
conversation!).  In fact, the buzz after your presentation was to the
effect that you gave one of the best industry/academic talks.

Please know that you have an open invitation to visit us.  You have my
email address and my office phone number is 404-894-2327.    I look forward
to hooking up with you again in the future.

Steve

p.s. If at all possible I would appreciate receiving any information
(reprints, etc.) that you feel would help us learn about the
industry.  Also, you mentioned a book that you said would be the best
introduction, but I forgot the name.  Thanks again.

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast and Solicitation


As we prepare for the kick-off of Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, Building Houston's Future, we are asking our top-level executives to set the standard of giving during the Leadership Giving Campaign that will run from July 23 through August 3.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.

Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way.  

You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans.

The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26.

Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com. 

At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are. 

Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st.

We would like to host a performance review session for all interns who are departing during this same week.  

The review session for your intern will be held on August 2nd at 10:00 am to 11:30 am in EB 35C2.  Please bring the completed performance feedback form for your intern to this meeting along with any other feedback from your team members that you may have collected. 

We will discuss each intern, cross calibrate their individual performances and decide which interns will receive full time offers.

If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me at X33242.

Dear All,
My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi. I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article ""The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives"" and he had mailed me the copy.
I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper ""Making the most of mean reversion"" to estimate the mean reversion speed. I use Queensland half-hourly price during 13 December, 1998-30 June 2001 giving about 44,000 price observations. 
However, the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept. The coefficient and standard error are as followed:
Intercept: -0.3931 (0.0076)
Slope: 0.1171 (0.0022)
R Square: 0.0585
Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign. I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same. It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter.
Kindest regards,
Visit

Vince -

The finance faculty and I have reviewed the vita of Richard McMinn.  He
appears to be a very good person but we are attempting to find someone who
is already or has the potential to be a major star to fill the Enron
Chair.  McMinn is not at that level in our judgment even though I am sure
that he would be a good person to have on a faculty.  At our stage of
growth and development, we need to fill tenured positions with extreme care
and with individuals who are or have star potential.

Thanks for bringing him to our attention.

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

Greetings All,

On October 7th at 2:57 p.m. (CST), Cindy gave birth to our son, Andrew
Joseph Edward.  Andrew weighed in at 6 lbs. 12 oz. and is 19 3/4 inches
long.  This makes him a very light feather weight, but we intend to get his
weight up for future Olympic competition.  Mom is doing fine but feels like
she has been hit by a truck.

We thank you in advance for all of your good wishes!

I hope this e-mail finds everyone in good health...and perhaps with a
renewed desire to baby sit in the bayou.

	Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group.  Right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year.  Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer.  What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis, who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer. 

	When we start the summer process, we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group.

	Is this okay with you?

	Hope all is well  with you 

	Take Care

The  Jones School has a newly designed website: please take a look at http://jonesgsm.rice.edu .  Look more than  once, please, because the homepage changes each time you visit.  Like all  websites, this one is -- and always will be -- a work in progress. Our goal is  to have the most useful and attractive business school website possible, and  your suggestions and comments will be greatly appreciated. Assistant Director of  Public Relations Maileen Hamto is the webmaster and project manager with ESX.  The design was done by RandomSky Design Studio. Comments and suggestions are  welcome: contact Debra Thomas, dthomas@rice.edu , 713-348-6343.
The website includes the Jones School calendar that will feature  all on- and off-campus events hosted by the Jones School, including the academic  calendar, student club activities and meetings, social events, recruiting trips,  CPC-sponsored events, etc. The calendar will replace the schoolwide internal  Yahoo! calendar.

Good Afternoon Vince, 
 
The HR Associate & Analyst program received Jill Schoenemann's resume from Beth Perlman earlier this month.  
 
I spoke with Jill to discuss the program with her and conveyed to her that compared with other candidates, she would be suited more as an analyst.  Currently, we are only hiring at the Associate level.  I also told Jill that the HR Associate/Analyst program was not the only way to begin a career in HR with Enron.  Jill will be one of the first we consider when we are hiring at the Analyst level later this year.  
 
Thank you for your further recommendation of a great candidate.  I will let you know when we are seeking to hire more HR Analysts.  
 
Kind Regards,
 
Adrianne Engler
HR Analyst

Subject:	Petrochem Desk

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

I shall be glad to help you in any way I can. Please, give me a call
(713 853 3848) to set up a meeting.

I shall ask Shirley to distribute your message to the entire group
and ask for the volunteers who will be interested in discussing
their experience with you.

Subject:	Research Group Teamwork

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to ""people"" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.   
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.  
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully, 
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)

We shall be coming on a company plane from San Jose and this gives us

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

As you all know, I am working with Vince to try and develop some effective communication skills programs for your group.  As a result, I am hoping that one outcome will be the formation of a new Toastmasters group at Enron.  Toastmasters is an organization that helps employees
give better sales presentations
hone their management skills
work better with fellow employees
offer constructive criticism
accept criticism more objectively.  

Before I begin trying to work out all of the ""details"" of this new organization, I would like to know how many, if any, of you have ever participated in this organization or would like to join.  Additionally, if you are interested in joining, please let me know your preferred meeting times (generally meetings are an hour to an hour and a half) such as at lunch or work.  

If you have any questions or additional suggestions as to how I can help your group meet your business objectives, please just let me know.

Thanks,
Anne

Hello guys:

Listed below is an email from Osman Sezgen, a former
Research employee.  He is in California and will not
be returning to Houston and wants to turn his laptop
and blackberry into the San Francisco office. 

I just needed to be sure that the Research Group was

Shirley,

I would like to return the Enron equipment that I have
to the San Francisco Office. Could you check with the
appropriate department to whom I should give the
equipment at the San Francisco Office. 

I know that April Hrach is the Administrative
Coordinator at the SF office and she deals with the
equipment issues. Please ask the appropriate
department to give me a name of a person from the SF
office and also notify that person.

Here is the equipment list:

(1) Blackberry (14879) 1-877-455-1927
(2) Laptop     (40115)

Regards,
Osman Sezgen

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to ""people"" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.   
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.  
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully, 
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)

I also had a disucssion with him on Dabhol, and will give you the details upon return.  The gist is that though we are unsure, 90% probability is in the direction of terminating the PPA and arbitrating.

We'll wait a day or so and give Steve a call.  I am sharing this with Amy Richard who will call Steve.  I will be in close touch with Amy on this matter and I look forward to meeting Steve.

   We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good
   meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now
   interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

   On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would
   be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron
   (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).
   Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his
   replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in
   asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so
   that he knows we are doing some work together.

   Paul,

   The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested
   in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn,
   senior vice president, Environmental and International Government
   Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said
   he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though
   I could not verify that he is now.

   The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the
   near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus
   strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How
   is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse
   gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30
   to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

   I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let
   me know if there is any other information you need.

   Thank you,
   Amy

   Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
   Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
   ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
   of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
   that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
   for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
   Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
   the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
   still be there but we can try.

   Thanks-
   Amy Richard

Enron chairman coming today, Girish Kuber 
 
THERE would be renewed efforts to resolve the Dabhol dispute with Kenneth Lay, the high profile chairman of Enron Corp, arriving in Delhi tomorrow. Mr Lay is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajapayee and finance minister Yashwant Sinha, besides power minister Suresh Prabhu. He will discuss the fate of Dabhol Power Company which is locked in a dispute with the MSEB. According to central government sources Mr Lay will take up the issue with none other than the Prime Minister and finance minister during his stay in Delhi. His itinerary remains a closely guarded secret with Enron officials unwilling to share any information on the issue. However, according to government sources Mr Lay's office had got in touch with the PMO to confirm the meeting. Mr Lay, flying in his Gulf Stream, would be reaching Delhi tomorrow. He is coming to India at a time when around six states have shown interest in buying the Enron power. However, these states are interested only if Enron makes it available at around Rs 2.50 per unit - which is unacceptable to the company.

So, we are optimistic,"" Cline said. He added he had briefed the finance secretary ahead of the meeting of Kenneth Lay, chairman of Enron, with finance minister Yashwant Sinha. Lay is also due to meet power minister Suresh Prabhu and other senior officials today in connection with the payment dispute between Enron's Dabhol Power Company and MSEB.

Enron chairman to hold talks with Vajpayee, Sinha, Prabhu Sanjay Jog

The Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, during his closely-guarded India visit, will hold talks with the Prime Minister AB Vajpayee, the Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, Union Minister for Power Suresh Prabhu and some of the upcountry contacts. Mr Lay, during his short visit commencing from late Sunday night, may also hold talks with the Congress president Sonia Gandhi and various political and business leaders in New Delhi. Informed sources told The Financial Express that efforts are on to organise a meeting with the Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and his colleagues in the ministry.The Dabhol Power Company (DPC) declined to give details about Mr Lay's visit. ""We don't want to comment,"" said its spokesman Jimmy Mogal. Mr Lay's visit deserves special significance, especially when the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has stopped power purchase from DPC since May 29, after issuing a notice to rescind its power purchase agreement with DPC. MSEB has also got shot in the arm when the Mumbai high court dismissed a writ petition filed by the DPC challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission to adjudicate upon its dispute and difference with MSEB.

Mr Lay, who alongwith DPC's former chief executive officer Rebecca Mark had convinced the necessity for survival of Dabhol project to the previous Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1996 and 1998, may have to make similar efforts again. Mr Lay in early May had made it clear that ""India can illafford the very public fight the Dabhol has become. It sends a bad signal to the rest of the world as to the difficulties of investors in India, which is not what India needs right now."" Mr Lay further said that ""India needs a lot of foreign investment if the country expects to build up its infrastructure."" However, Mr Sinha had contested Mr Lay's claim and said that ""there is no need for us to think that because there is a problem with Enron, it is necessarily going to act as a dampner to foreign direct investment.Mr Lay's visit is also crucial, especially when the the Congress president Sonia Gandhi during here recent US visit has assured the American leadership that the Congress-led government in Maharashtra will make every effort to amicably resolve the Enron controversy. The former union finance minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who was accompanying the Congress president, had told the US leadership that the effort now is to find an amicable and mutually satisfactory solution based on purely economic and business considerations.

Meanwhile, DPC has relaunched an advertisement campaign entitled "" why do I then write to you today?"" coinciding Mr Lay's visit. However, the anti-Enron lobby is quite amused to see the ad campaign as it alleged that the DPC is misleading the people. According to a senior leader of anti-Enron movement, it clearly shows that Enron had minted money during its operation since may 1999 and it has funds to spend on ad campaign, especially when the power generation has been closed since May 29. The anti-Enron lobby is expected to press for the judicial probe against Dabhol deal at the coordination committee meeting of the constituents of the ruling Democratic Front scheduled for July 11.

Enron India chief optimistic about Dabhol 

The chief executive of Enron Corp's Indian arm said on Monday he was optimistic about working through the company's payment dispute with a local utility. ""There are a variety of options facing us with the project. We are just trying to work through those,"" Wade Cline told reporters in the Indian capital after a meeting with the finance secretary. ""We are having good meetings with the ministry, so we are optimistic,"" Cline said. He added he had briefed the finance secretary ahead of Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay's meeting with Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha. Lay is due to meet Sinha, the power minister and senior officials in connection with the payment dispute between Enron's Dabhol Power Co and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board which has defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol. Enron's project is the largest direct foreign investment in India. Its first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1998, while a second phase adding another 1,444 MW was almost complete when its contractor stopped work because of the dispute. (Reuters)

Judicial probe sought into Enron imbroglio
 
THE STATE executive of the BJP in Maharashtra on Saturday passed a resolution favouring a judicial probe into all aspects of the 'controversial' agreement signed between the state government and the US energy major Enron. The resolution is perceived by political analysts as a move aimed at forcing the DF government to agree to a judicial probe into the Enron issue even though the ruling DF coordinating committee had earlier deferred a decision on the question to July 11. At a closed door meeting held at Dombivali in Thane district on Saturday, the BJP state executive stated that ""it had nothing to hide and is in favour of a judicial probe."" The resolution also lambasted the DF government for 'playing politics' and ""trying to settle scores with the NCP chief Sharad Pawar,"" according to BJP spokesman B Atul. ""If there is a demand for a judicial enquiry into the Enron issue, the BJP is not opposed to it,"" he said. The change in the BJP's stand on the Enron issue at this juncture is significant as the BJP national vice president Gopinath Munde had earlier opposed a judicial probe in the matter. 

Coming down heavily on the ruling DF government for raking up old issues and pressing for reversal of the names of Sambhaji Nagar and Dharashiv to their original names, Atul alleged ""the government is practising revengeful politics."" Flaying the DF government for adopting a communal overtone, the resolution further stated that the state government's attitude is aimed at disturbing the social harmony of the state. The BJP's changed stand on contesting the local self-governing bodies election also figured at the meeting which passed a resolution calling for an alliance with the Shiv Sena during the zilla parishad and civic elections, deviating from its earlier stand of '100 per cent bjp', Atul said. Around 300 party workers, including BJP leaders, Gopinath Munde, Union ministers Ram Naik, Pramod Mahajan and Jaywantiben Mehta were among those who attended the meeting, presided over by the state BJP president, Pandurang Phundkar. The meeting will conclude on Sunday, Atul added. (PTI)

Privatise MSEB generation, distribution: Panel
 
EVEN as Maharashtra grapples over its energy crisis with US energy major Enron, Godbole Review Committee has recommended outright privatisation of the loss-making state electricity board's distribution network and generation unit in the second part of its report to be submitted on July 11. ""The report outlines path breaking reforms, which not only suggests restructuring of MSEB, but also makes its clear that its once-a-very-good board will be destroyed, if it continues as a government body"", official sources said here on Sunday. The report would be submitted to the state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Tuesday morning, sources said. ""The committee has recommended that MSEB's government ownership should be dissolved, however, the control of transmission network should rest with it"". ""MSEB's current assets are close to worth Rs 12,000 crore and once Cabinet approves the proposal following submission of the report, process like inviting tenders from private parties may be taken up"", officials said. 

According to the report, the interested companies would have to infuse capital investment in the distribution and generation networks with an increased rate of return at about 4.8 per cent, sources explained. The 200-plus pages report draws a detailed road map for the need to privatise MSEB, a different model from what was implemented in other states, sources added. The sources said experiences of Orissa, Haryana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh were closely studied by the panel and then it decided to recommend this model of privatisation. ""The mantra of privatisation of only distribution network has failed all over the country"", official sources said. The report has emphasised on creating distribution network zones in the state's urban and rural areas respectively, bids for which could be invited for, they said. ""The rural zones are very crucial for us"", sources said adding, ""the report recommends that these should be handed over to any private party, be it a co-operative like the Pravara Electricity or a non-governmental organisation with a clear cut subsidy payout"". The committee has also worked out a subsidy model, which would intersperse with a special ""transmisssion charge"" levied by the state government after privatisation to the companies, official sources said. ""The report suggests that the transmission company should levy a surcharge over an above the billing chargs, which would be used for recovering the cross-subsidies"", the sources said. The aim to privatise only distribution and generation is to facilitate pure trade of power and avoid any kind of other interferences, mainly political, the sources added. (PTI)

Dabhol employees sure company will pull out, Deepak Lokhande

When Enron Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay arrives in India today to try to renegotiate the Dabhol power project, he will find that his employees are certain the company will pull out of the venture. "" Everyday the government adopts a new stance. We have been given an indication that the company will pull out,"" said a senior officer working with Dabhol Power Company (DPC), Enron' s Indian subsidiary. "" When the company was ready to renegotiate, the state government was adamant that it wouldn't hold any discussions. Now, when they are pressing for renegotiations and a reduction in tariff, the company is not willing. Lay will meet Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and apprise him of the state government' s changing stands,"" he said. The atmosphere at the Veldoor plant near Dabhol is one of gloom. Recently, several thousand workers were laid off when the plant was forced to shut down because the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) refused to purchase electricity. MSEB claimed that DPC did not fulfil conditions of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). "" There used to be 10,000 labourers working at the plant, either on the construction of the second phase, which is 90 per cent complete, or for the first phase generating electricity. Today, the plant looks like a smashaan (cemetery). Workers keep asking each other who is the next to go. It is sad,"" he said.Till recently, the main gate of the plant would be thronged by daily wage workers. Today, there are hardly any. Even those having permanent jobs with DPC are not sure if their jobs are safe. Stories of how even senior officers were shown the door in an unceremonious manner are making the rounds. "" The other day a very senior officer was told that he was not required any more. By the time he reached his residence provided by the company, his phone lines were cut. He had to go out and phone relatives and friends. He was asked to collect his dues the next day. On arriving at the gate, he was in for another shock. He was asked to get himself a visitor' s pass with restricted access. It was shocking,"" said a contractor.

Villages suffer with Enron shutting shop

Enron is going back, and going back with it are the riches it brought to Guhagar and Dabhol talukas. Most hit are traders at Shringartali (Tali), a market that is 10 km away from Veldoor, where Enron built its 2000 plus mw thermal power plant. The crash here has been more severe than the dotcom crash as business volumes have reduced by more than 1000 per cent and the real-estate market has hit rock bottom.Says Uday Deolekar, who owns a building material shop at Tali, ""It used to be Diwali time while the project was on. On Sundays, the four-lane road would throb with buyers."" The party was over, however, with the state Government pulling the plug on Enron. Gloom took over as workers started leaving the project site around February. There has been little business activity since then.Deolekar used to run a small shop of pan-beedi and groceries till about eight years ago when Enron came to Dabhol. Construction activity picked up in the area and Deolekar, with his brother-in-law Mohan Sansare, seized the opportunity and started supplying building material. Business flourished and the Sansares took over a plot of land to open four more shops. Sitting at one of them, Deolekar is waiting for customers today.""Villagers in Tali and nearby areas wanted to refurbish their houses to accommodate paying guests coming in hordes. There was great demand for accommodation and hardly any supply. While blue-collar workers were happy with dormitory-type arrangements, white-collar officials wanted one-room, kitchen, attached bath type apartments. Many villagers started constructing lodges and boarding houses to cater to demand. Little did they realise that the party would have come to an end in any case once the construction was over,"" says Deolekar.

However, his brother-in-law Mohan is happy that Enron is going back. ""They were quite arrogant. They may have brought money to this area, but they also brought all the vices - booze, gambling and what not. Enron will go back, cash flow will dry up but these vices will now remain with us forever,"" he says. He wants an Indian company to take over the plant and run it. Naseemshet, owner of Kasam Mohammed Memon shop, is one of the biggest traders in Tali. ""I used to work for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). When Enron officers came here in 1994, they stayed in my guesthouses. I was pressurised by the party then to break off my ties with them, but I told myself I must keep politics out of business. I am happy I did that. See how BJP leaders are now backing the project to the hilt. I received bulk orders and business shot up. Last three years were crazy. Now we are back to square one - catering to around 6,000 buyers from nearby villages,"" he says.

The Memons rented out an entire building, accommodating around nine persons for Rs 21,000 a month during boom time. Now the building does not have any takers even for Rs 3,000 per month. The Memons had also started a transport business seeing the vast money involved. Dabhol Power Company (DPC) used to pay Rs 45,000 per month to hire a Tata Sumo. ""Our drivers started their own business. After the crash, they have come back to us begging for Rs 2,500-a-month job. But now I can't afford them,"" he says. Nandu Bartakke, who owns a grocery shop in Guhagar, recalls how Rs 10 per kg rice would be termed as ""expensive"" by locals. ""After they got jobs at DPC, however, their lifestyles changed. They wanted Surti Kolam rice, which costs Rs 24 per kg. If I said it was costly, they would tell me they couldn't digest the Rs 10 per kg rice. They forgot that they grew on that rice,"" he says. Most of these locals, who had suddenly become rich with their Rs 10,000-a-month jobs with DPC, are yet to get over the crash. Bartakke claims traders from Chiplun market, which is 35 km away from DPC site, reaped rich dividends. ""They knew what an industry requires. They have been catering to MIDC's industrial estate at Lote Parshuram for years now. They carefully invested their money and focussed on what DPC needed. Hardly any of them ever indulged in temporary markets such as real estate or transport,"" he says.Agrees Shailesh Warwatkar, a shop-owner in Chiplun market. ""We concentrated on chillar items such as plastic bags, ball pens and stuff like that. It was astonishing to see DPC paying Rs 5.25 for used gunny bag, otherwise priced at 60 paise in the market. DPC always wanted huge quantities in real quick time, and they paid any price that was quoted."" 

Not all have made money though. For Hari Babu of S N Instrumentation, the experience has come as a shocker. His company was awarded a sub-contract by Punj-Lloyd. Babu came in February and by April, DPC was sailing in troubled waters. Since mid-June Babu has hardly had any work. He has sent back 78 people from his team and is awaiting further instructions from his company's office in Kolkata. ""We will sue them. How can they a terminate six months' contract just like that?"" says a livid Babu. But he knows the futility of his anger. ""We will sue Punj-Lloyd. Punj-Lloyd will slap case against Sanscra, the French company. Sanscra will start legal proceedings against Bechtel. Bechtel will file suit against DPC and DPC will go in arbitration against Maharashtra Government. It's a long and never-ending chain."" 

DPC auctioning jeeps, computers at throwaway prices 

Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and several other companies who were involved in the setting up of Dabhol Power Project, have started auctioning four-wheelers, computers and are likely to put on sale refrigerators and air-conditioners.The buzz in the area is vehicles like Tata Sumos, Mahindra Armada, Commander and Jeeps are available at throwaway prices. ""They are selling vehicles kilo ke hisaab se. I heard a jeep was available for just Rs 27,000,"" said Warwatkar. Indeed, there were a few vehicles put on sale at the site carrying a price tag of Rs 29,000 for 1997 Commanders. But the tag also mentioned of major breakdown of engine as known defects. Most other vehicles were available at a minimum bid price of Rs 60,000 onwards and looked in bad shape after a rough use in difficult terrain. Bodywork was required in most cases. Locals, however, believe it's still a good buy.

The goods are, however, are offered to employees first, who bid their price. Some of them have started selling these goods at higher prices to others. Naseem Memon bought a Mahindra Marshall for Rs 1.11 lakh through one of the employees who had bought it at company auction, and immediately got an offer of Rs 1.25 lakh. Memon is not selling it just now. ""I will repair it and I am sure it will fetch at least Rs 1.75 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.,"" he says. The area is flooded with buyers from Mumbai, Karad, Satara and Pune. Shortly, computers, fridges and ACs will also be put on sale and DPC employees will have their hands full with requests from outsiders.

Subject:	Re: The first document for audit

Vince:

I read the relibaility-based VAR method document with interest.

Here are some comments:

1. The document falls short of describing how
to use the method in practice, but rather
gives some general motivation. I am confident
that I myself could not develop an algorithm
based on this document, unless all of the
derivative valuation functions are explicit
(and rather nice) functions
with explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which case
the VAR problem is not so hard in any case,
as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case.
(My comment here is critical of exposition.
I do not suggest that the proposed method
is weak!)

2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Pan
addresses only normal returns is not
correct. The main point of our paper was to allow
for jumps, including fat tails and skewness.
The comment that we rely on delta-gamma
is a good criticism,and the main potential
advantage of the reliability approach,
if it works in practical cases.

3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines from
the bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))

4. There is a missing `we' on page 5, 9 lines
from the bottom.

5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) does
not mention what machine was used.

6. The example (page 8) does
not really have much non-normality. Skewness=0,
and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?)
are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosis
is an extra order of magnitude, with lots
of skewness.


Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot,
and left me wanting more clarity,
and a cookbook.


I hope `events' at Enron have not made things
difficult for you.

I will later bill you for one hour, if that is OK.


Warmest personal regards, Darrell

Greetings All,

On October 7th at 2:57 p.m. (CST), Cindy gave birth to our son, Andrew
Joseph Edward.  Andrew weighed in at 6 lbs. 12 oz. and is 19 3/4 inches
long.  This makes him a very light feather weight, but we intend to get his
weight up for future Olympic competition.  Mom is doing fine but feels like
she has been hit by a truck.

We thank you in advance for all of your good wishes!

I hope this e-mail finds everyone in good health...and perhaps with a
renewed desire to baby sit in the bayou.

Something to brighten your day - these are great!

************************************************************************

The boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees about an
urgent problem with one of the main computers.  He dialed the employee's
home phone number and was greeted with a child's whispering, ""Hello?""

Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a youngster the
boss asked, ""Is your daddy home?""

""Yes,"" whispered the small voice.

""May I talk with him?"" the man asked.

To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, ""No.""

Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, ""Is your mommy there?""

""Yes"", came the answer.

""May I talk with her?""

Again the small voice whispered, ""No.""

Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left at home
alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who
should be there watching over the child.  ""Is there any one there besides
you?"" the boss asked the child.

""Yes,"" whispered the child, ""a policeman.""

Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked
""May I speak with the policeman""?

""No, he's busy,"" whispered the child.

""Busy doing what?"" asked the boss.

""Talking to daddy and mommy and the fireman."" came the whispered answer.

Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a
helicopter through the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, ""What is that
noise?""

""A hello-copper,"" answered the whispering voice.

""What is going on there?"" asked the boss, now alarmed.

In an awed whispering voice, the child answered, ""The search team just
landed the hello-copper.""

Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated, the boss asked,

""What are they searching for?""

Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffled giggle:
""Me.""

********************************************************************************

Never Ask Your Child a Question Too Many Times

Have you ever asked your child a question too many times?  Here is an
account from one woman:

My three-year-old son had a lot of problems with potty training; and I was
on him constantly. One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in
between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room.

While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course I checked
my seven-month-old daughter, who was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not
asked to go potty in a while, so I asked and he said ""No"".

I kept thinking, ""Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have
any clothes with me.  Then I said, ""Matt, are you sure you did not have an
accident?""

""No,"" he replied.

I just knew that he must have had, because the smell was getting worse.  So
I asked one more time, ""Matt, did you have an accident?""

This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his
cheeks and yelled: ""See, Mom, IT'S JUST BOTTOM BURPS!!'  While 100 people
nearly choked to death on their tacos, he calmly pulled up his pants and
sat down to eat his food as if nothing happened.  I, of course, was mortified

Some kind elderly people made me feel a lot better, when they came over and
thanked me for the best laugh they'd ever had.

******************************************************************************

And one particular four-year old prayed, ""And forgive us our trash baskets
as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets.""

******************************************************************************

A little boy was overheard praying:  ""Lord, if you can't make me a better
boy, don't worry about it.  I'm having a real good time like I am.""

******************************************************************************

Fun in Church

[From James Dobson]  One Sunday, a young boy was acting up during the
morning worship hour.  The parents did their best to maintain some sense of
order in the pew but were losing the battle.  Finally, the father swung the

little fellow up on his shoulder and walked sternly up the aisle
on his way out to deliver some thoroughly deserved discipline.  As they
exited the church auditorium, the little one lifted his head and called to
the congregation, ""Y'all pray for me!""

*****************************************************************************

A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the way
to church service, ""And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?""

One bright little girl replied, ""Because people are sleeping.""

*****************************************************************************

The preacher moved briskly about the platform as he preached emphatically.

Because he was wired for sound with a lapel microphone, he jerked the mike
cord as he went.  When he moved to one side, he got wound up in the cord
and nearly tripped before jerking free.  After several circles and jerks, a
little girl in the third pew leaned toward her mother and whispered, ""If he
gets loose, will he hurt us?""

*****************************************************************************

Six-year old Angie and her four-year old brother Joel were sitting together
in church.  Joel giggled, sang, and talked out loud.  Finally, his big
sister had had enough. ""You're not supposed to talk out loud in church.""

""Why?  Who's going to stop me?"" Joel asked.

Angie pointed to the back of the church and said, ""See those two men
standing by the door?  They're hushers.""

******************************************************************************

After the church service a little boy told the pastor, ""When I grow up, I'm
going to give you some money.""

""Well, thank you,"" the pastor replied.  ""But why?""

""Because my daddy says you're one of the poorest preachers we've ever had.""

********************************************************************************

A father was at the beach with his children when the four-year-old son ran
up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore, where a seagull lay
dead in the sand.  ""Daddy, what happened to him?"" the son asked.

""He died and went to Heaven,"" the dad replied.

The boy thought a moment and then said, ""Did God throw him back down?""

Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support

Guys,

Here is what I took away from our meeting:

1). Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline data.

2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data

3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort, presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the right track.

If this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can discuss.

Thanks,
Andy

Subject:	Hello


Hi Vince,
 
Hope my mail reaches you. I am really sorry that the Enron saga is coming to such an end. I have closely followed developments through the press. Personally, I continue to be proud to be associated with the company and more specifically with the Dabhol Project. I have learned a lot in my three years at Enron and hope to continue to learn from the experiences of its people.
 
I saw you at Rice a few weeks back, but you were very busy and was hence unable to talk with you. I am leaving for India tomorrow and will return only in the second week of January. Its probably obvious, but the enron debacle has affected my future career options and also does severely constrain me in more ways than one. Hope the lunch offer still stands open, will take you up on it in January. 
 
I hope the holidays prove to be a time of relaxation for you and your family. Wish you a merry christmas and Best wishes for the new year to you and your family.
 
Regards,
Anshuman

Dear Mr. Vincent Kaminski,

I am a first year student at the Jones Graduate School of Management, Rice
University. Mr. Peter Veruki, director of CPC in Jones School, recommends me
to contact with you about the possibility to work as a MBA intern in your
division this summer.  With keen interest, I would like to have my
internship in Enron to conduct analytical market research or other related
jobs.

I worked for nine years in the business service industry in China, boasting
with diversified experience in market research, strategic planning, and
business development. Years of practice endow me not only the first hand
experience of quantitative analyses and marketing research, but also the
ability to solve problems under the intense competition and challenge.
Furthermore, I learned how to deal with clients from different cultures and
circles. In the past several years, the clients I served include Adobe
software, Dell notebook, HP computers, Disney entertainment, Shell Oil,
Northwest Airline, NOKIA cell phone, Sun servers, and many other global
companies. I had some knowledge about energy industry by participating in
the marketing projects for Shell Gas station and China Petroleum Import and
Export Corporation.

As you will learn from the attached resume, my business experience
concentrates on market research, implementation of marketing strategies, and
business planning. Three years ago, I started APT Netcom with two partners.
I was in charge of both business strategic development and media sales. At
my initiation and leadership, we set up a new Internet-based media sales
platform for advertisers and agencies. In 1999 the newborn company achieved
revenue of $9 million.

Enclosed is my resume with details of my work experience and professional
skills. I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss with you my credentials
in details. I will be available for an interview at your earliest
convenience. Thanks for you attention.

Sincerely,


Allen (Qizhi) Shen

Vince,

I am just trying to make sure that all of the data is clean for your PRC meeting on Wednesday, and noticed that although Shane Green and Chris Pernoud are both specialist, Shane is Commercial Support (CS) and Chris is Specialized Technical (ST).  Please let me know if this is correct or if they should both either be ST or CS.  I am assuming that they should both be CS since the Sr. Specialist are all ST.  Additionally, I just wanted to let you know that the following people will not be rated during the meeting because their hire date was after December 31, 2000:
Anguel Grigorov
Wichai Narongwanich
Chris Pernoud
Leann Walton

Finally, please verify that you do want to do rank the assistants tomorrow.  As you know, ranking the assistants is not required, but is a business unit leader decision.  

Thanks,

I work in Government Affairs and pulled together the California briefing materials you requested last week.

I would like to follow-up to see if the materials we provided you were useful.  Is there anything else you need? Was anything missing that you suggest we provide to others within Enron in the future who come to us with similar requests? 

Finally, I understand that you wanted to look over these materials in preparation for a meeting this week.  If you come across other ""California solutions"" documents presented by other parties, I would appreciate if you could forward a copy to me (EB4731 a).

Thank you for any feedback you can provide.

Apropos to the questions in today's talk:
 
(1) whether a random variable X, a Multivariate T distribution, = bZ (where b is a univariate r.v =sqrt(v/y), and y is 
a chi-square distribution with v degrees of freedom), can be correlationless, attached below is a succinct proof.

(2) One might think that since we are multiplying 2 random variables (i.e., Z is 2 dimensional) by the same scalar random variable (i.e., b), then the resultant random variables would tend to rise and fall together, and hence necessarily be linearly correlated.  However, as is shown below, if Z is uncorrelated, then X is uncorrelated.

Please note, our approach is analagous, but not identical to the Glasserman and Co papers (distributed to Research).  Glasserman computes the characteristic function of the Pr(P/L > x), so to compute the entire P&L pdf he would have to repeat the procedure for every value of x.  We circumvent that iterative approach (with the messy characteristic function) and compute the pdf in one shot.
Please note, we are not comparing full reval vs. delta-gamma at all, that is a completely different story.

Subject:	Neptune

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

Vince - You are the greatest!  Duke was in our minds as a possible new
sponsor but we had not figured out yet where to start.  I will talk with
the others and we will definitely pursue this Mr.  Ladd.  I really can't
begin to express how appreciative I am that you thought to mention this to
him.  I am in New York right now so it will be next week before we can
start the process.

I'm glad you can come.  I'm very sorry about what happened at Enron.

I look forward to getting a chance to hook-up with you.

I will go ahead and have you registered, without affiliation, unless you

Importance: High


Hi Jeff and Vince!
 
Just have a second, but I wanted to give each of you as much lead time as possible.
 
Please reserve 11:30 -1:30, August 15th.  I've arranged to have Raffi Amit and Lee Goldring from the WeBI program come to make a luncheon presentation about WeBI, eFellows, Enron's participation, etc.  This will not be a pitch for $$, as we've already committed.  The hope is to engage the people at from the appropriate business units that might best benefit from participating in WeBI.
 
We're paying for it anyway, yet I haven't been able to get anyone at Enron to participate.  I've been participating so as to at least hold Enron's place ""in the WeBI queue"", but I'm sure we can be taking better advantage of the intellectual capital exchange our participation affords us.
 
I'll consult with you both at a later date about good ""invitees""---I've reserved the Enron board room on 50.
 
...gotta run--I'll be in touch!
 
Thanks!

Hi Vince,
 
Hope my mail reaches you. I am really sorry that the Enron saga is coming to such an end. I have closely followed developments through the press. Personally, I continue to be proud to be associated with the company and more specifically with the Dabhol Project. I have learned a lot in my three years at Enron and hope to continue to learn from the experiences of its people.
 
I saw you at Rice a few weeks back, but you were very busy and was hence unable to talk with you. I am leaving for India tomorrow and will return only in the second week of January. Its probably obvious, but the enron debacle has affected my future career options and also does severely constrain me in more ways than one. Hope the lunch offer still stands open, will take you up on it in January. 
 
I hope the holidays prove to be a time of relaxation for you and your family. Wish you a merry christmas and Best wishes for the new year to you and your family.
 
Regards,
Anshuman

Vince,
 
Henwood is in the process of developing a new  product that, for lack of a better name, we are calling Market Stack.  The  purpose is to allow traders to utilize the load and supply data in EMSS without  the hassle of a full-blown simulation.  The software would be designed to  allow traders to develop a market (or supply) stack with a minimum number of  keystrokes.  The stacks could be developed for a utility, transarea, or  region, would contain load data, and would be capable of incorporating real-time  information to provide fundamental insight and market advantage.   
 
At this point in the process we are looking for  ideas (and sponsors).  If you think your traders might be open to the idea,  I would like to talk to you and them about it, and potentially as early as next  week.
 
Please advise.
 
Thanks,
Eric

Enron wants govt to buy Dabhol stake 
 
US energy group Enron on Saturday said it wanted to sell its stake in the Dabhol Power Company either to the Indian government or to the project's lenders. ""As the largest investor in the DPC, Enron believes that selling its interest either to the government of India or to the project's lenders is the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute,"" a spokesman for its Indian unit said. This follows comments made by Enron chairman Kenneth Lay in Friday's issue of Financial Times that Enron is looking to exit from its Indian venture. The Dabhol Power Company, 65 per cent owned by the Enron, is locked in a bitter dispute with a local utility over a payments default. ""We want out,"" said Enron's Chairman Kenneth Lay in an interview with the Financial Times. DPC which is India's biggest direct foreign investment, had signed a contract to supply power to a state-owned utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, from its gas-based plant on the state's west coast. But MSEB stopped buying power in May calling it expensive and defaulted on payments jeopardising the project's future. 

""We have made it pretty clear to the government leadership we are now at a point where we would like to be taken out and we think most of our partners do,"" Lay said in the Financial Times. Besides Enron, the other shareholders in DPC are US group General Electric and Bechtel which own 10 per cent each and MSEB with 15 per cent. Earlier this month Lay had a meeting with India's finance minister Yashwant Sinha to try and resolve the issue but talks ended without any solution. ""We have fought this once before, put it back together, fixed the contracts, but we don't want to do that again and have the same problems in a few years,"" Lay was quoted by the paper as saying. DPC's power plant is being built in two phases. The first phase of 740 mw is up and running and the second phase of 1,444 mw is 97 per cent complete. Some analysts say India's attempts to resolve the Enron dispute is a test case of its ability to attract more foreign investment. Last week US assistant secretary of state on South Asian affairs, Christina Rocca, said the problems surrounding India's investment climate could be summed up in a five-letter word, ""Enron"". ""I have to emphasise that it will be difficult for international investors to view India favourably until it (Enron issue) is resolved and in a reasonable manner,"" she said. (Reuters

Enron wants govt to buy its Dabhol stake 

US energy group Enron Corp said on Saturday it wants to sell its stake in the Dabhol Power Company either to the Central government or to the project's lenders.""As the largest investor in the DPC, Enron believes that selling its interest either to the government of India or to the project's lenders is the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute,"" a spokesman for its Indian unit told Reuters.

FIIs okayed DPC loans as provided for Int arbitration 

INTERNATIONAL lenders of Enron's Dabhol Power Company, including the US government's Overseas Private Investment, have said they extended loans worth about $444 million to the project only because the PPA provided for settlement of disputes by neutral international arbitration. ""Had the PPA not provided for settlement of disputes before arbitration panel in a neutral forum, we would not have disbursed loans worth about USD 444 million,"" DPC's 11 foreign lenders have submitted in an application seeking intervention in the energy major's petition, to be heard by the Supreme Court next week. ""The PPA constitutes the project's backbone as DPC's entire revenues were to be received from Maharashtra State Electricity Board and were the basis for our decision to extend the said loans to the $3-billion project"". The FIIs say that MSEB knew that the cost of developing and building the project would be obtained, in substantial part, from loans provided to DPC on a ""non-recourse"" basis by them and other lenders. ""MSEB had expressly confirmed, agreed and acknowledged that monies due to DPC from itself would be paid directly to an account (escrow in this case) created for our benefit and security"", they said. Emphasising for international arbitration in dispute resolution between DPC and MSEB, the FIIs submitted before the Supreme Court that the arbitration provision to be held in London, a neutral international location under the UNCITRAL rules, was ""critical factor in their decision to fund the project"".

Centre to keep off Dabhol spat 

The Centre is unlikely to intervene directly in the Dabhol problem despite Enron's willingness to sell its interest in the 2184 mw project to the government. Power ministry sources said the government has made its intentions very clear on this issue on several occasions that any direct intervention by the Centre was highly unlikely as it would face severe opposition from other states. ""There is absolutely no change in that stance at present,"" said an official. The Centre was inclined to play the role of facilitator only in arriving at a solution to the problem, and the central government's representative in the re-negotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra government had already been asked to expedite the proceedings, he said. Enron in a statement on Saturday said that as the largest shareholder in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), the company believed that selling its interest either to the central government or to the project's lenders was the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute between DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). It stressed that any sale would need to be on terms providing a complete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures. The company pointed out that the Dabhol issue was clearly having an adverse effect on the confidence of potential foreign investors to India. ""Pursuing a buyout option could help resolve the dispute in a timely manner protecting India's investment climate and interests of DPC's stakeholders,"" said the statement. The company said that while DPC remained open to discussing other viable solutions, it had serious concerns about getting embroiled in a series of re-negotiations. It pointed out that no realistic proposal was offered to the company as yet, and no progress had been made in securing creditworthy buyers that can purchase power at a price that was reasonable for new-generation plants. The statement said that until the issue was resolved DPC intended to continue pursuing all other remedies under the PPA, such as international arbitration, to resolve the issue in a way that protected the rights of DPC sponsors, lenders, fuel suppliers and LNG ship owners. 

Pressure tactic, says lenders 
Lenders to DPC are unmoved by the company's demand that they take over the project and dubbed it as a pressure tactic. The company had said in a press release on Saturday that the best solution would be for the Union government or the lenders to take over the project. ""We need to run our banks and institutions and not a power project,"" said one senior banker involved in the project. The lenders however accept the fact there is a sense of urgency and the government must get into the act faster. At the London meeting last week, DPC showed its willingness to run Phase II of the project on naphtha but MSEB is not willing to give its nod to commissioning of the Phase II

MSEB, FIs plan roping in Centre for picking Enron equity in DPC , Sanjay Jog

Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and Indian financial institutions (IFIs) are planning to make a last ditch effort to rope in the BJP-led government at the Centre for picking up the Enron equity in the Dabhol project through its undertaking as their funds amounting to over Rs 2,500 crore in addition to a guarantee of Rs 3,900 crore to offshore lenders are involved in the project.The MSEB has contributed nearly Rs 800 crore to pick up 30 per cent equity in the Dabhol phase-I and the IFIs have collectively lent Rs 1,738 crore for both the phases plus a guarantee of Rs 3,900 crore to offshore lenders. MSEB and IFIs sources told The Financial Express that the Enron chairman Kenneth Lay's statement on Enron's desire to pull out of Dabhol project has not come as a rude shock, but as an expected one. However, these sources said that if Enron wants to be out of 2,184 mw Dabhol project, their exist should take place after ""tough"" negotiations with an active involvement of the Union government.

They have projected various scenarios including the Enron, General Electric and Bechtel collectively agreeing to recover about 50 to 60 per cent of the total equity of $900 million in the Dabhol project from the Industrial Development Bank of India, which is a rupee lender consortium leader. The MSEB and IFIs are aware that the Enron and other equity holders will insist on the full capital recovery and that they will be quite keen on purchase of their equity with interest at par by the new buyer.
However, MSEB and IFIs sources are of the view that due to their hard bargaining in the presence of the Centre, the Enron and other stakeholders may arrive at certain compromise so that they can recover a substantial amount blocked in the project. Secondly, in view of cut in the equity, the loan amounting to over $1.2 billion could be restructured at the lower interest of 12 per cent and that the moratorium period should be increased. Thirdly, the Centre will lend a financial support to its undertaking to pick up majority equity and take over the Dabhol project, they feel. According to MSEB and IFIs, in another scenario, the state-run Gas Authority of India Ltd (Gail) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) should be asked to take over the liquified natural gas (LNG) project in a serious bid to cut the tariff. The per unit tariff, which has been average at Rs 8.80, may come down to Rs 2.20 to Rs 2.40 per unit. The Dabhol Power Company is believed to have spent nearly Rs 2,500 crore on the LNG project.

Moreover, the MSEB, which is at present doubtful over the fate of its equity of Rs 800 crore, may pick up 51 per cent equity and appeal to the Mumbai based utilities Tata Power and BSES for taking up the balance equity in the Dabhol project. The MSEB and IFIs are keen that the impending issue be resolved amicably, especially to avoid the legal battle in India and arbitration in London. A section of MSEB is confident that the power purchase agreement (PPA) on the issue of misdeclaration and default on the availability of power by DPC can be proved null and void and there will be no need for the payment of any compensation to DPC. This will enable the take over of Dabhol project by an Indian entity quite possible. Lay seems using pressure tactics Mr Lay's statement on Enron pull out is being seen in the political circle as a pressure tactic, especially when the Supreme Court is hearing the DPC's petition on August 6.

'Four states not to buy power at current rates' 

Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal said on Saturday that though four states have expressed their willingness to purchase power from the Enron-promoted Dhabol power project they are not in a financial position to buy them at the prevailing tariff. ""All wish to purchase power but not at the current rate"", Bhujbal said after a function organised by ex-servicemen. Four states, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka and Punjab had agreed to buy power from Enron's troubled Dabhol Power Project at a tariff as low as Rs 1.65 to Rs 2.60 per unit during a meeting Godbole Renegotiations Committee had with prospective buyer states on July 26 here. Replying to a query regarding the US giant's desire to pull out of the power project in India, he quipped, ""jinko jaana hai wo jayenge, unko koi rok nahi sakta"" (those who wish to leave will leave, no one can stop them). He, however, expressed hope that the current Enron imbroglio would be settled after the Supreme Court delivers its verdict. The state government would deal with the issue depending on the verdict of the Supreme Court, Bhujbal added.( PTI )

Maharashtra's offer unrealistic: DPC 

US energy major Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on Friday said that price proposals made by four states to draw power from the Dabhol project ""were totally unrealistic"", even as Godbole renegotiations committee reported a stalemate in the talks with DPC. Referring to the offer of Karnataka, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to buy power at a tariff as low as Rs 1.65 and Rs 2.60, DPC said, ""unfortunately these are totally unrealistic proposals, unattainable by new generation liquid plants, including those set up by the public sector"". On the other hand, after meeting DPC officials on Friday morning, Madhav Godbole told reporters that currently talks with DPC had reached a stalemate with interested states quoting lower prices than the US energy major's expectation. After discussions with four states and receiving communications from Haryana and Rajasthan, he said that all these were ready to draw DPC's 1,444 mw phase-II power at an average rate of Rs 2 to Rs 2.25 per unit. ""An overall demand for DPC power is at around 800 mw to 1,000 mw, but not all of these is a base load one. Moreover, it is for more than half a year, mainly non-monsoon months of November to May,"" Godbole said. He added that the states had informed the commission that each of them had a regulatory framework in the form of an electricity regulatory authority in place and was bound by a merit dispatch order, which did not allow them to buy costly power (like DPC's) so long as cheaper tariff was available in their own state.( PTI )

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Saturday, 28 July 2001
Demand for DPC power only at `particular' price 
 
THE Godbole panel today conveyed the power-offtake proposals of six States to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) officials. The company was told that there was combined demand for 800-1000 MW power at not more than Rs 2.50 per unit. ``One thing is abundantly clear. There is demand for (DPC) power at a particular price. If the price increases the demand may not be large'' Dr Godbole told reporters. `` We have told Enron that the need for 800 to 1000 MW DPC power is not at baseload, nor is it an all-year-round demand. The States will require this power only between the months of April to November and the demand will fall during the rainy season,'' he said. 

Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh made representations to the panel yesterday. Rajasthan and Haryana have presented written proposals asking for 300 and 100 MW each. While Madhya Pradesh has asked for power at Rs 1.65 per unit, other States have said they will not pay more than Rs 2.25 to Rs 2.40 per unit. According to Dr Godbole, the company officials will ``take up the matter with lenders and collaborators'' before the next meeting which is expected to be held in August. Meanwhile, according to DPC, the power purchase proposals presented by various States ``are totally unrealistic and unattainable by new generation liquid fuel plants including even those in the public sector such as NTPC's Kayamkulam''. Dr Godbole had suggested that DPC power ``at competitive rates'' could replace captive power in a number of States. He said though DPC had earlier agreed to reduce tariffs by 50 paise, this would no longer be easy as the project has seen cost escalation after stoppage of phase II work. `` Our dialogue with Enron is bogged down by two issues-- the plant load factor at which the unit is run and the price of power,'' Dr Godbole said. He said there was a need to take a `` serious look at whether demand projections in the country are realistic''.

Maharashtra to pay Rs 788cr penalty to MSEB, Girish Kuber 
 
MAHARASHTRA has decided to pay Rs 788 crore to the ailing Maharashtra State Electricity Board to compensate it for the damage it has caused the power utility through tariff concessions to various sectors. Padmasinh Patil, the state's energy minister, had wanted to give tariff concessions to farmers, which was objected to by MSEB. Even the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission asked the state's energy department to restrain its generosity. The MERC had asked the government not to offer concessions at the cost of its SEB and directed it to make a budgetary provision if it wanted to go ahead with its plan. Accordingly, Mr Patil announced last year that the state government will compensate the board. The MERC had set a deadline of October 2001 for sanctioning the compensation. The supplementary demand presented to the state assembly makes this provision. ""It has been decided to give subsidy to MSEB to compensate the loss arising from supplying electricity at concessional rate to agricultural and powerloom consumers with effect from May 1, 2000,"" said the demand by the state's finance ministry. 

Currently, concessions of 55 per cent and 33.33 per cent in the electricity bills is given to powerloom and agricultural consumers. The total expenditure involved in the proposal is estimated to be around Rs 788 crore. The issue of offering concessions to powerloom and agriculture consumers has been hanging fire for the last couple of years. The board last year had raised the tariff for agriculture and powerloom consumers which was opposed by the state government for obvious reasons. The government announced a roll-back of the tariff hike only to be prevented by the MERC from doing so. The MSEB will now be charging Rs 600 per one horse power pump, bringing down the rate from Rs 1,400, and Rs 185 per loom down from the earlier rate of Rs 300. The government has also decided to waive 55 per cent of the Rs 110 crore unpaid dues from powerlooms. Delayed payment charges for the defaulters has also been waived and they have been granted three instalments for clearing old dues. According to MSEB's own admission, more than 118 lakh of the total 130 lakh consumers are being supplied subsidised power.

"Var Issues","A few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become more
controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would
like to share with you a few observations.

1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system to
Enron (and the P/E ratio).

A number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in
massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this
crirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system and
our strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk management
technology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.

It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can
convince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) about
the quality of our financial technology. This can be done 
through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.
by reality.

2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.

The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input
information as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to
the market observations (as opposed to historical data).

One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks
information and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.

One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the
trading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect
between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices 
curves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized 
forward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will 
systematically fail. 

One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically
fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the 
source of problems we see in some books.

3. VaR process management.

Given the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory,
a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.
What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality
of the results.

Specifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility
for the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization
and resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we have
inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used 
currently in the system are 2 years old.

Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view 
some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal
usefulness (and in some case on questionable
understanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to
bring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties

The move for this week-end has been submitted and cannot be changed.  I've talked to the head of the move group.  She is aware that you are in 1968 and will not be moving until later.  This is fine.  Next week we'll schedule your move - I'll talk to you then about what you'll be moving and where.

He will probably be at your office around 9:30 AM.Permit me to recommend that you consider re-booking him on CO #1045, with an ETD of 9:35 a.m. and an Austin airport ETA of 10:28.  I teach a (non-energy) class from 9:30 - 11, so Vince's arrival on that later flight would work.  Alternatively, if he arrives at 9:30 he is most welcome to attend my 9:30 class or simply work in my office as he wishes.

Subject:	Patent attorney

Vince: 
I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my  
recommendation on a patent attorney.  I cannot give you a personal  
recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  
file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  
trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  
position by filing my own ""provisional patent application.""  This establishes  
the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  
with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  
property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  
these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  
your son's software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  
in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  
practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  
282-1856. 
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  
visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  
forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  
intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  
intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:   
pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) 
yet2come.com 
Hope this is helpful.

Larry Thorne

is a summary from Highway 101 North & South:

      Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino
      Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university.
Stay
      in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus.  At the
four-way
     stop, turn right onto Campus Drive.  Take first left (Lasuen Street)
and drive
     to the end and park.  Conference site is at this building.  If you do
not yet have

I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting.

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Iris/Amitava,

I may have already said this, but we've had so many e-mails and telephone calls flying back and forth that I wanted to make sure I at least got this much out to you.  Clearly, I would like you to set up the meeting with the RiskCalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology (as much as they'll tell) and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model may have.  Also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model extends to other countries.  I know from a previous conversation with Lea Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off North American names but they suspect it might extend to other countries.  Conversely, I know they are working efforts within Moody's Risk Management Services to develop private (and probably public) firm models specific to regions.  One they mentioned was Australia and also within Western Europe.  Data, as always, was the issue.  See if the quants have any perspective on their success/plan in that area.

Lastly, we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward pushing off this private model initiative and I'm very confident we'll be able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either D&B and/or Experian data.

Cheers,
Scott

Ooops... part II.

I just threw out 12 as a number for something we might develop... it's really not based on anything.  We know 17 will work for pre-packaged programs.  We also know there will be a great number of names with less than the full 17... I assume we would pursue another model (internal or external) to provide probably less accurate numbers but at least available for names with fewer inputs.

Hi Mike,

	Thanks for your email.

	What do you mean by ""buying blind  all major data associated with these specific DUNS numbers""?

	I am puzzled about why you would be looking at 17 vs 12 fields.  I know RiskCalc requires 17 inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work for less than 17.  Yesterday the RiskCalc sales people could not guarantte that their model would work for less than the required 17 data inputs.  They suggested that this would be a question to direct towards their quants who developed the model.

Iris

Iris,

Thanks.

After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further.

Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... we have DUNS cross-references on about 70 of active names (13k out of 18.5k).  We could greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major data associated with these specific DUNS numbers.

Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP, but without resolution on which specific fields are most useful.  We also get to test for completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... how many have only 12 of which fields, etc.).

Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher... buying info we don't know we need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn't seem best answer).  We would end up buying additional info later... overhead costs and piecemeal buying will increase costs.  IT development time would be greatly increased... multiple file formats... developing to unknown maximum size, etc.... redoing when more data is purchased.


Any thoughts.



Mike

Dear Vince

I recently saw an announcement of Enron's risk management chair at Rice
University.  Do you know about it or the people at Rice?  While I'm having a
great time working with Swiss Re here, I am thinking about coming home for
my wife's sake.  Do you think that Rice would be open to a person in risk
management with an insurance as well as a finance background?  That was
certainly not true at Texas and that's why I'm asking.

I hope all is well there with you.  I did appreciate your presentation to my
finance classes there at the University of Texas a couple of years ago.  I
also appreciated the assistance that you recently gave one of my Texas Ph.
D. students.  He was and I still am working on pricing weather derivatives.

Subject:	Potential Prospect


Hey Vince,

Given that the Eastern Finance Conference is already taking place, I think
it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round
table discussion.  However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially
having been on such a round table discussion.

I've been teaching a ""real options"" course that has the students performing
monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along
with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your
new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.
However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is
particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option
pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually
figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.

This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talented
themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you
and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you
recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?

His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would
preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is
George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a
potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a
particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.

Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too
much.

I know that each of you has just said,  ""FINALLY"",  and I do apologize for the delay.   As I explained to you earlier this week, Ken, we wouldn't want to have you actually sign the papers until very close to your last day at Enron, because the interest will run from the date of your signature. 

Please take a look at the document and call me with any questions.  I will need to know the exact loan amount to complete the loan document, and will have to ask Legal to sign off before it's executed.

Hello Vince;

Joseph Doucet has passed along your name to me, in regards to exploring
opportunities between Enron, and the Natural Resources and Energy MBA
students at the U.of A. I would be pleased to assist in any capacity, from
helping organize an information session by Enron to our students in the fall
at the U.of A., to co-ordinating job interviews for permanent or summer
internship positions, and everything in between! My function is to assist
MBA students and appropriate corporations to find each other! I look forward
to hearing from you.

Today's focus: Flaw in AOL Instant Messenger

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

In this issue:

* Patches and alerts for AOL IM, IE 6.0 and Linux mutt
* Viruses, including the new ZaCker e-mail worm
* CIA-backed analysis tool to be used for passenger checks,
  plus other interesting reading

Despite the roller coaster ride the economy has put us on this
year, networking remains a thriving, vital industry. In Network

Today's focus: Flaw in AOL Instant Messenger

By Jason Meserve


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Hole in AOL Instant Messenger discovered

A security flaw in the way AOL's Instant Messenger handles game
sharing requests could be exploited by a malicious user to run
arbitrary code on the affected machine. The victim may be
helpless, short of powering down the machine, to stop the
request. AOL is working on a fix, which will be applied to the
servers that run IM. Users will not have to download a patch.

For more:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0102aim.html


* Vulnerability found in IE 6.0

Microsoft bug hunter Georgi Guninski has discovered one of the
first bugs in the new Internet Explorer 6.0. According to
Guninski, the GetObject() function has a poor security
mechanism that can be easily exploited to transverse local
files and execute arbitrary programs on the affected machine.

For more, go to:
http://www.guninski.com/getob3.html


* Patch release for mutt

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in mutt, a mail user
agent for Linux. The one-byte overflow can be exploited by a
malicious user. For general updates and to get more
information, go to:
http://www.mutt.org/announce/mutt-1.2.5.1-1.3.25.html

Debian users can download the appropriate patch from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-096


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* JS/Seeker-E - A JavaScript-based virus that attempts to set
Internet Explorer's home and start pages to a pornographic
site. (Sophos)

* Win32/Maldal.G.Worm - An e-mail worm that spreads via Outlook
by sending itself to everyone the Outlook Address book and by
searching the infected hard drive for addresses embedded in
HTML pages. Infected messages have the subject line of ""ZaCker""
and an attachment called ""ZaCker.exe"". The virus also will
overwrite a number of file types. (Computer Associates, Sophos,
Symantec)

See story at:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0103zacker.html

* Troj/Download-A - A Trojan Horse program that comes as two
files, ""dlder.exe"" and ""explorer.exe"". They can be used to send
information about an infected computer to outside sources.
(Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:


* CIA-backed analysis tool eyed for passenger checks

Data analysis software backed by the CIA and used by some
casinos to catch gambling cheats is now being tested for its
potential to detect suspected terrorists and their associates
when they make airline, hotel or rental-car reservations.

Vince,
I realise that you don't have time for email or anything these days.   I just wanted to say that I'm very sorry to hear about everything that is going  on at Enron.  I hope that you are OK?  
 
I understand that Enron Europe is pretty much ending  business tomorrow, except for Enron Metals.  It's all very  shocking and unbelievable.  Just to let you know, and maybe it will benefit  someone, we will be looking to hire someone to head some things up for us in  London.  So if you know of anyone who may be jobless over here, feel free  to have them contact me, or send them the attached draft job  description.      
 
Please stay in touch and best of luck to you.
 
Sincerely,
Julie Brennan

Hi Vince,

Given the recent developments in Enron's financial outlook and likely need for expense control, I wanted to ask you if Enron would still agree to pay for my French lessons going forward.  My french tutor is possibly going to return to France to retire in the coming months, but I think I will probably continue with my lessons until the end of this year.  I have been thankful that Enron has financed these expenses in the past, but understand in tough times we all need to make sacrifices.

Thank you.

Vince,

I have updated the Historical transactions spreadsheet, up to yesterday's data, and it can be found as an attachment. You will notice a drop-off in the number of EOL transactions over the past couple of weeks, but at least the figures are not yet at zero! Most significantly, the volumes of the Power desk have decreased.

Subject:	Patent attorney

Vince: 
I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my  
recommendation on a patent attorney.  I cannot give you a personal  
recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  
file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  
trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  
position by filing my own ""provisional patent application.""  This establishes  
the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  
with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  
property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  
these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  
your son's software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  
in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  
practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  
282-1856. 
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  
visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  
forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  
intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  
intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:   
pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) 
yet2come.com 
Hope this is helpful. 
Regards, 
Larry Thorne

Subject:	RE: Resume

Vince,

	he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background (and then some credit exposure calculation) with not much credit data analysis experience.  I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryan's group -- he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway.
	If you want to pursue him, we should probably do a phone interview first.

S&P Credit Indices 

                  S&P Credit Indices reflect daily movements in credit spread levels within two
                  sectors of the U.S. bond market. S&P Credit Indices are quoted in basis
                  points over the U.S. Treasury yield curve once daily. 

                  Credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are
                  represented in the S&P U.S. Industrial Investment Grade Credit Index while
                  movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the
                  S&P U.S. Industrial Speculative Grade Credit Index. 

                  Each credit index represents the distribution of U.S. corporate issues across
                  different rating categories and subsectors. Re-balancing occurs regularly to
                  ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues with sufficient
                  liquidity. Pricing information for the S&P Credit Indices' underlying securities
                  is derived from a number of sources. 

                  Option adjusted spreads (OAS) are used as a proxy for nominal credit
                  spreads in order to adjust for the presence of embedded options. Standard &
                  Poor's utilizes the proprietary option adjusted spread model developed by

I thought some of you might be interested in this half day seminar at UT.  Bill Hogan, as well as speakers from the ISO and PUC are scheduled to speak.  I plan to attend.  If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for $145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person.  Ross Baldick, one of Martin Lin's and my advisor is the moderator.  It may prove both interesting and contentious will Hogan being there.

Subject:	RE: Job posting

Dear Vince,

I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he
interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am
wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after the
graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me any
longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment and
all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired
at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not quite
what I expected.

Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting
position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact
with the right people? I would really appreciate it.

Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).
Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Helen Demianenko.

Hello Rakesh and Gwen,
 
 
I am sorry that I have been out of pocket all week and did not have access to my e-mail.  I have just returned from NY and want to thank you for all of your hard work in helping us track the data.  You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.   I apologize for making numerous requests but everything that you have provided us will be useful to SSB.  
 
SSB has been provided with some information.  They will be incorporating the information that you have provided as well as information from the traders in their board presentations.  At this stage, I believe that we have done all that we can.  If I hear something further, I will let you know on Monday.
 
Again, thank you very much for all of your help.

Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Vincent,
Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like
quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has
done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

  Contact information:

I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.
 
On another note, Jason gave me two names for the Energy Club.  I will contact them shortly after finals next week.
 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you again.

Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these
corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts
traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of
the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary
services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge
for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in
whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.

We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the
summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an
anchor tenant concept).

As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow
in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll
keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual
challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.

Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

Ed

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Vince,

As I mentioned in my voice mail, Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody, a recent MBA grad from Rice, into his group.  However, when we were talking about this position, Mike compared Sara to Elena.  Elena's title is admin coordinator, and I know that Sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that Elena should also.  Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work.  

I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah's duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad.  If the latter is the case, we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66K).  Please advise.

Thanks,
Anne

Attached you will find the cash data that I have been using to derive my graphs.

In terms of the method I used to derive the average of $10 million/day, I used the net cash inflows for September and the net cash outflows for October and calculated an average based upon 41 business days.  The average came out to be $6.22 million/day and I then grossed it up a bit to be $10 million even.

Subject:	2002 Plan Variance from 2001 Forecast
Importance:	High

Vince,

As part of the plan process, I have to prepare a variance analysis between the 2001 forecast and the 2002 plan.  I have attached a summary for your review and I need your help explaining some of the variances.  The 2001 forecast is based mostly on plan, but I did use an annualized amount for some expenses for which the actuals were considerably above or below plan.  Please let me know if you think I need to adjust the forecast because this will, in turn, affect the variances.

The main items I need are as follows:

1) An explanation of the increase in headcount (14 people (26%) over the average of 53 I have forecasted).

2) The Recruiting and Relocations account is new for 2002 - these costs were previously included in Travel.  Therefore, I would expect that the sum of Recruiting and Relocations and Travel for 2002 would be comparable to the 2001 Forecast for Travel alone, but there is a variance of about $140,000 (38%).  I expect that much of this is due to the increase in headcount, but that is not enough to fully justify the increase.  Are you expecting a higher level of travel in 2002?

3) Same as above for Conferences and Training.  This is a new account and these costs used to be in Tuition Reimbursement (this account included all training).  The increase in Tuition Reimbursement alone is really more than I can explain as due to the increase in headcount.  Are there specific conferences planned for 2002 that were not attended in 2001?

4) Can you give me a breakdown of what is included in the amount for Outside Services?

5) If I understand your allocation percentages, you will allocate 100% to other business units, compared to the approximately 73% that is forecast.  Is this correct?

Thanks for your help,
Diane

Subject: Price Dynamics and Risk Management in the Energy Markets

Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. I work for Aspen Technology Inc. www.aspentech.com
We have not met, but a colleague of mine forwarded a copy of your
presentation on Price Dynamics in the Energy Markets from the SIAM
conference last April and am writing to you to encourage you to consider
making a presentation at Aspen's corporate world conference Aspen World 2002
in October in Washington DC on this topic as well as the broader topic of
Risk assessment and management in the energy markets. I know this seems a
little strange making a ""cold-call"" in this manner, but I am reaching out in
the community of Risk and Uncertainty management in the Supply Chain,
Process and Energy markets to identify and solicit compelling speakers.
AspenTech does not have a traditionally strong or well developed business or
application layer in this realm, but, as our enterprise-wide reach and
activities in planning, forecasting and supply chain have grown and
integrated, I and the technology drivers in the company have been
cultivating a demand and recognition for risk management and pricing
activities to BE the next logical dimension to our growth and technology.
Therefore, the session I am chairing (see the abstract below) will be one
intended to educate, entice, and compel our clientele, business partners and
staff on the business value, technology and mathematical and modeling
technique. I would be happy to elaborate on the intended audience and
opportunity for the conference. Please contact me at your earliest
convenience by email or phone at the numbers below to discuss things if you
think it would be a possibility or, if you would like more information on
the context of the work and subject matter in AspenTech's core businesses.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Sincerely,
Skip Paules

Uncertainty and Risk Management in Supply Chain and Process Modeling

This session will examine the assessment and quantification of uncertainties
and risk in the supply chain and process modeling arena. The emphasis is on
the modeling and enterprise business process aspects. Topics should include:
point solution methods, such as design and real-time optimization
application at the process level; planning and scheduling applications; as
well as enterprise level solution strategies that balance forecasting,
supply chain, planning, scheduling and operations. Commodities trading
models, strategies and techniques are also included in this scope. What
developments in the applications and theory of the field will allow us to
take collections of deterministic modeling tools to the next strategic level
where objectives for capital projects, operations, and supply chain
optimization models incorporate not only economics, but also value-at-risk
and/or robustness elements to create more broadly applicable or hedged
strategies to achieve the desired goals.

Possible presentation topics will include:

*	Uncertain supply, demand in planning and scheduling
*	Robust plant-wide optimization (real-time)
*	Robust control
*	Value-at-risk (VAR) quantification in modeling applications
*	Dynamic hedging in commodities trading (e.g. energy markets)
*	Flexible design and synthesis
*	Model sensitivies to uncertain parameters or demand
*	General algorithmic and modeling strategies for incorporating Risk,
Sensitivity, and/or Uncertainty

Have you or a member of your group had a chance to look over the forwarded e-mail yet?  We have a meeting on Thursday with another potential client who plans to use his own capital.  His capital budgeting issues are similar to those of the client who prompted my original e-mail.

The more DSM projects that we can help the client get approved, the more DSM savings we can share with the client.  These DSM projects can turn a retail commodity contract with low profitability into a substantially more profitable contract for us.

Would one of your GARCH analyses provide us with a quantitative solution?  One of your experts in differential equations might have devised something.  We'd really like to have something quantitative if you think it's at all possible.

Subject:	DSM projects as real options   

Vince:

Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power Point presentation?  At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the following:  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES customers who employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR hurdles may be lowered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow for the extra value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced power consumption/dependence.

I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewing a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive.  First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we exercise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple NPV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate ""negawatts,"" extending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--whenever the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity price, associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value of this strip a ""residual time value"" associated with the original DSM option.  If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total value that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able to help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high IRR hurdle.

Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a ""qualitative"" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers to lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.

We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage around his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside a large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a small portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology, which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.

In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification, or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in the attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify ""residual time value"" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of a more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?

Thanks,

Jeff Gray

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.

EIA to Display Draft of New Storage Survey at GasMart/Power 2002

Dulles, VA -- January 25, 2002-The Energy Information Administration will display its plans for a new weekly natural gas storage survey, as part of an extensive program exploring the wholesale gas and power markets at GasMart/Power 2002, March 18-20 in Reno, NV, hosted by Intelligence Press, Inc.
In a special session Wednesday, March 20, 2002, EIA Senior Analyst Roy Kass will outline the agency's new weekly natural gas storage survey which will replace the current survey conducted by the American Gas Association. Due for release in early May, EIA's survey is expected to become the most critical piece of data informing the market. During the conference, attendees also will be able to visit EIA's Showcase area to see and discuss with its creators, the draft version of the agency's new product.
In other sessions at the 16th annual GasMart/Power forum key natural gas and power representatives will come together to hear about strategies in the current low energy price, high security environment, and --- the impact on the competitive market of the collapse of Enron, the market's largest and most zealous supporter.
Keynoter Richard Sherrill, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of Duke Energy North America will assess the state of the wholesale natural gas and power market, offering his strategies for instilling customer confidence in the face of the wrenching market disruptions of the last few years. He also will offer his views as to the market share for electronic trading and the outlook for electric restructuring? 
Energy guru Ben Schlesinger will explore the impact of Enron's collapse on other marketers; on rules and regulations; and on the political scene.  Will Congress intervene to re-control gas and power prices?  How long will energy investors shy away from major commitments?  Are we in for another boom-bust price cycle? Did the skyrocketing energy prices in California and other parts of the nation in the latter half of 2000 and early 2001 carry the seeds of the current bust, weakening industrial customers, bankrupting the largest marketer, and ultimately reversing gains in the competitive market?
In others of the 18 sessions at GasMart/Power 2002, Dynegy Vice President Peter Esposito and Jim Macias, Sr. Vice President of Calpine tell what's ahead for power generation. ?Williams Energy Marketing & Trading President Bill Hobbs and TXU Vice President Jeff Shorter assess the winter...Futures analyst Cynthia Kase instructs on technical market analysis ?
FERC's Shelton Cannon, Deputy Director, Office of Markets, Tariffs & Rates, explores RTO development and the standardization of market design and market rules?Representatives of the California Energy Commission, the Cal-ISO, the Western Power Trading Forum, Bonneville Power Administration and Southern California Gas discuss various aspects of western gas and power markets? 
Gordon Shearer, Poten Partners, and TransCanada Vice President Steve Becker report the latest developments on the LNG and Arctic gas fronts?and Richard Sharples, Senior VP, Marketing & Minerals, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Arthur L. Smith, Chairman & CEO, John S. Herold, Inc. strategize on how to survive for the long haul in E&P. 
The annual GasMart/Power conference is sponsored by Intelligence Press Inc., publisher of the industry's real time, daily and weekly publications, Natural Gas Intelligence, NGI's Daily Gas Price Index, Power Market Today and NGI's Weekly Gas Price Index.

Dr. Kaminski,
thanks for your mail.

I am sorry that I'll not be available earlier,
I will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, I may be able to start it from June1,
depending on what he tells..
We will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so I'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

And could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

Thanks!

What's New at ERisk.com, 4 May 2001

****************************************************
This week&#8217;s Essentials is brought to you by ERisk Analytics 1.0, the first executive information system dedicated to strategic capital management. Learn more about this comprehensive new software solution and how it delivers enterprise risk management analytics that effectively link risk, capital and shareholder value.

****************************************************

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://www.erisk.com/news/weekly/news_weekly2001-05-04_01.asp
This week's economic, banking and P&C insurance news, from an enterprise risk management perspective. Featuring exclusive coverage of this week&#8217;s RIMS conference in Atlanta.

ANALYSIS
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_analyses.asp
?	Who matters most - stakeholders or shareholders?
?	Risk managers neglect overseas operations at their peril.
?	Mobile banking is on the way - but will banks benefit from it?

BASLE RESOURCES
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp
Now you can find all ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive coverage of the Basle II proposals on bank capital adequacy in one place: www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp. You&#8217;ll find all our recent coverage, including features, event transcripts, news stories, interviews and analysis along with links to other resources, regulatory summaries and rating agency and industry association responses.

BASLE SPECIAL
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_features.asp
Continuing our special coverage of the proposed new regulatory capital rules, we look at Basle&#8217;s approach to operational risk. Rob Jameson explores the proposals to set a regulatory capital charge for op risk, and canvasses industry opinion on how they might work in practice.

VIEWPOINT
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_viewpoint.asp
In this special Q&A, Ashish Dev of KeyBank talks to ERisk about what his bank has discovered so far from its internal testing on the impact of the new Basle proposals. It&#8217;s too early to say for sure, but many banks may not find much reason to improve their risk management practices. You can find out Dev's perspective on the Basle proposal in our iConference archive.

ERisk PRODUCT CATALOGUE
http://www.erisk.com/store/store_product.asp
ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive Product Catalogue is a one-stop shop giving full details of the systems and services available to risk managers.

Subject:	Benchmarking Study


Vince,
 
We met several months ago with Peter Nance of Teknecon Energy  Risk Advisors (TERA) to discuss Enron's possible participation in our  benchmarking study.
 
Our original schedule has slipped, and I was wondering if you  might reconsider participating.  Here is a presentation that Peter did for  us in Washington DC where 50 companies came to learn more about the study.   Also attached is a sample list of metrics.
 
The kick-off meeting will be in the second week of October in  Houston.  Please let me know if Enron would be interested in joining the  study team.  We have several companies in the top 20 signed up.  I  would be happy to review the list with you over the phone.
 
Best regards,

Subject:	Data Mining Course

Vince,

In the light of our discussion this morning about EOL, I have investigated the possibility of taking a two-day Data Mining Course. I believe this would considerably help in coming up with ideas about how to analyse the EOL database, as well as providing some initial experience in the use of data mining tools and techniques. I found several possible courses that could prove valuable in this regard, and some of these are listed below. The first of these was recommended by Eric (Cope), and is the earliest of the courses that I could find, so I will plan on registering for it unless there is good reason not to.

1. ""STATISTICAL LEARNING AND DATA MINING: from Supervised to Unsupervised Learning"" - Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (both of Stanford Univeristy); to be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Sept. 6-7, 2001; Cost = $1,250. (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/MRC/mrc.general.html)
2. ""How to Successfully Mine Data"" - Dr. Richard De Veaux and Herbert Edelstein (Two Crows Corporation); to be held in Bethesda, Maryland, October 8-9, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.twocrows.com/dmcourse.htm)
3. ""Statistical Data Mining"" - Dr. Brian D. Ripley (University of Oxford, sponsored by Insightful); to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 15-16, 2001; Cost = $1,800. (http://www.insightful.com/train/ripley.htm)
4. ""Tools for Discovering Patterns in Data: A Survey of Modern Data Mining Algorithms"" - John Elder (of Elder Research); to be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, October 16-17, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.datamininglab.com/newcourse.html)
5. ""DATA MINING: LEVEL I - An intensive introduction to methods, applications and resources"" - Tony Rathburn (The Modeling Agency); to be held in Dallas, Texas, November 27-28, 2001; Cost = $1,095. (http://www.the-modeling-agency.com/training/dm1.htm)

We're ready to go.   I have set up the reception from 5:00 - 6:00  September 10th. It will be held at the Hall of Honors (in the CBA) and the Energy Finance Group will also be invited.  After the reception, I think it would be wisest to have Billy and Vince join the corporate presentation, which is scheduled from 6:00 - 9:00pm.  The summer interns receiving full-time offers will be invited to attend.  That way, they can share their summer experiences with the audience.
 
I think Professor Ronn's itinerary is great!
 
Please let me know if you have any additions or corrections to the plan.
 
Thanks!

Professor Ronn, Billy and Lexi:

September 10th works great for Vince.  He suggests the following if it works for your schedules:

1.  Lunch on the 10th with Professor Ronn and colleagues (to be coordinated by Professor Ronn)
2.  Vince's presentation to MBA students:  2:00 - 5:00 PM
3.  Associate/Analyst Reception:  5:00 - 7:00 (?) (to be coordinated by the Associate/Analyst Program)
4.  Dinner with the Associate Analyst group:   7:30 PM or whenever the reception is over. (to be coordinated by the Associate/Analyst Program)
 
Please let me know if this is workable with everyone or if you have other suggestions.

Greetings.  Not to worry:  I like heat and thaw out in the '90's.

Sep. 10th is indeed feasible.

I scheduled the invitation dates of 9/24 - 10/17 to give me time to make
progress in my class presentations so that students would have more of a
background in listening to Vince's presentation.  If select the 9/10 date,
I would ask Vince to take into account in the level of his presentation
that by that date the students will only have had 6 hrs. of the Foundations
of Energy Finance class (classes begin 8/29 and Labor Day intervenes).  On
the plus side, the students do come in with three finance courses (core
course, investments, advanced corporate) as prerequisites to my class.

In sum, I appreciate the importance of recruiting and can accommodate
Vince's presentation Sep. 10th.  Please advise if Vince would like the 2
1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or the 75-min. subset
thereof.

>Perhaps we could arrange lunch or dinner the day of the presentation

I had planned on hosting Vince for lunch with my faculty colleagues.  If
his presence is called for at a lunch scheduled by your Associate/Analyst
Program, we will plan his schedule around that.  By this e-mail I also
inquire of Lexi whether Enron intends to host a reception at the 5 p.m. end
of the class:  If so, she should contact Energy Finance Center Assist.
Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (or 512-232-7386) to

A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.

I. Projects (in the order they suggested it).

	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market
	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.

	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without
	full trade automation.

	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.
 
II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments 
   per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.

	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 
	    Enron's participation.

	2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.

	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through
	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support
	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify
	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.


Recommendations:

	1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.

	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship
                with UBS.

	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from
	    Prediction Company.

==========On the McKinsey Quarterly Web site this month==========

What happened to the bull market?
By the time NASDAQ had maxed out in the recent bull market, many financial
commentators were claiming that something structural had changed in the
economy: new economics and the increasing value of intangible assets and
brands, among other things, were supposed to have replaced more
traditional factors in determining stock market valuations. Nice in
theory, perhaps, but wrong in practice. McKinsey analysis shows that the
traditional triumvirate of earnings growth, inflation, and interest rates
continues to drive stock prices.
http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1104&nlink=21

Broadband media: Look before you leap
How long will it be before broadband for consumers revolutionizes
television and video entertainment? After all, some 40 million households
in the United States will gain access to broadband during the next three
to five years. But broadcasters and other programmers would do well to
temper their enthusiasm, at least for now: the time isn't right to invest
heavily in broadband programming.
http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1100&nlink=22

Brains abroad
Where does global talent go when opportunities aren't sufficiently
plentiful at home? To the United States, of course. In the 1990s alone,
some 650,000 people from emerging markets migrated there on
professional-employment visas. This talent drain could have lasting
economic repercussions for the developing world, depriving it not only of
the skills of these workers but also of their beneficial effects on the
productivity of others.
http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/ab_g.asp?ar=1101&nlink=23

Better UK productivity: An inside job
There is little debate that Britain's manufacturing sector is in decline
but less consensus about the reasons for it. A recent McKinsey study makes
clear that the problem isn't the quality of the country's workforce:
foreign-owned companies in Britain, drawing from the same pool of
frontline labor as their British-owned competitors, are achieving much
higher levels of productivity. The fault instead lies with British
manufacturing companies that have failed to adopt practices proved
elsewhere.

helping organize an information session by Enron to our students in the fall
at the U.of A., to co-ordinating job interviews for permanent or summer
internship positions, and everything in between! My function is to assist
MBA students and appropriate corporations to find each other! I look forward

Vince,

Pursuant to our conversation, I called Jim Kenney (281-297-3557), head of Entergy Management Operations (EMO), which is the entity responsible for ETR's 4-state regulated system.  He indicated that they were looking for someone with IS skills to manage their EMS.  The point of contact for this is Charles Sanders (281-297-3575).  Jim indicated it would be a combination of Hardware/Software skills.  Entergy has a very large and complex regulated system, and I would assume that the EMS (responsible for real-time decisionmaking for Generation response to load) would be quite complex and challenging.  He indicated that he would write a note to Charles to expect your call.  If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Best Regards,
Dale

Vince --

I realize you may be busy with the news that UBS is the winning bidder for
Enron's trading organization.

Looking ahead, I invite you to speak at the Market Price Volatility
conference, to be held May 1-3, in Houston.

This follows on the Gas Volatility and Storage Valuation conference held
last October. This spring's conference will focus on power volatility, and
will include a number of applied econometric presentations.

The format of the preconference workshop, on Wednesday, May 1, will be much
the same as in the past. Your speaking slot is for a one-hour presentation
in the afternoon, followed by a roundtable.

I hope you will join in what promises to be a stimulating event.

Please confirm your participation by e-mailing or calling me by
Thursday, Jan. 17.

Following your confirmation, Jim Naphas of INFOCAST will be in touch
regarding the usual details.

Best regards.

Dear Vince,
Thank you for sparing some time to talk with me about the opportunities at
Enron.
As a Computational Finance student with a chemical engineering background, I
am very interested in pursuing my career with Enron as this will give me the
opportunity to employ the skills that I have developed during the course of
my education and experience. I am currently working on an external project
with Professor John O'Brien, on the Effect of Convexity on pricing
Eurodollar swaps and I am confident that this experience would help me in
understanding the effects of volatility on derivative prices, which is a
fundamental component in the energy markets. Also, I am currently doing a
project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating
environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy
markets in general. My education, as well as my experiences have helped in
honing my quantitative, analytical and computing skills, and have given me a
significant insight into the global trading industry.

I am enclosing my resume along with this mail. As mentioned in our
conversation, I would like to pursue a career in Energy trading and
research.

Hoping to hear from you soon.
Best Regards
Prakash

Vince - Hrvojesuggested that I drop you a note.  I am with an Austin Ventures portfolio company and we may have room for junior research people (1 or 2).  If there are some analysts or associates in your group who would be interested in talking to us and need a home, please feel free to have them call me or send a resume.  We would talk to anyone who can code option pricing formulas.  JAVA skills, or good Object Oriented programming experience and sufficient mathematical background for the FE work are priorities.  Our Chief Architect would like to see some Database understanding, but that is somewhat more flexible.  American options and Swing options are current issues, although any exotics experience is fine.  I would consider contract/part-time if someone would like to take a project while looking for positions with another larger company.
 
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your group.  I wish we had more immediate needs, but perhaps at the margin this can help.
 
Warm Regards,
Ashley

Subject:	Get Together This Coming Tuesday?


Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

"Weather group seats on the trading floors","John,

A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group. I understand the
new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.

My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weather
groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views,
the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will 
defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.

If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups
under Mike's leadership.

Please, let me know what you think.

Subject:	Spring Fever Volleyball Tournament - More Info

The message below relates to a volleyball tournament that will be held at the end of the month. If you are interested in being part of a Research Group team, please let me know ASAP, so that we could form a team and even practice (!?) a time or two. I am told that most of the teams entered are in the ""social"" category - we would be going to have fun, not a serious competition! Please note also that the teams entered must be coed, so we need Ladies as well as Gents.

Thanks,

Tom

Subject:	Hi,

Dr. Kaminski

How are you?
The process for starting summer work is going well,
and there will be no problem we start work
on May 30.
I got a place to live, and reserved a flight.
I'm going to leave for Houston on May 29
(expected time to arrival is around noon)
I am very much excited to have opportunity
to join the project making an exchange platform.

I think it's time I'd better remind you
of scheduling a meeting with me,
sometime on May 30.

I hope you let me know what to to
after I arrive at Houston.
And please let me know if you have anything
you think I prepare, to get better outcome
from the summer work.
If you give me a brief on the work,
it would be a great help for me to decide
which material I should carry from here to Houston.

I look forward to the date we meet,
Warm regards,

Jinbaek

Eric,

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/
interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
I think our participation may a bit higher.

Vince,

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or associate economist level.

Thank you.

Subject:	updated INFORMS slide

Vince, 
Attached here is the actual version of the slides I presented at INFORMS conference. Many people, including an area editor of Operations Research journal, showed their interests so I am thinking about publishing a paper about it. Of course, I will show it to you first before sending it to outside. 
I also met a guy from Bell Lab working in Lucent's Bandwidth trading group. He said that Lucent allocates about 3-4 researchers to work in this area. He said Lucent believes that the bandwidth demand will eventually pick up so they want to be the first one who provide products and research for supporting bandwidth trading. I agree with him that research work should not be stopped and bandwidth trading will become a reality in the next few years.
This time the conference is very big. They have 45 parallel sessions presenting at the same time for 3.5 days.

Vince,
 
We were just notified that all pre-petition wages, including vacation, will be paid up to 15K.  As a result, we are trying to determine how much people should carryover from last year, generally 40 hours is the maximum.  However, if employees were unable to use their vacation last year due to business circumstance (i.e. Mike Roberts group) or is a supervisor acted to limit or cancel and employee's vacation during the course of the year, we will be granting exceptions.
 
I have listed below individuals from your group who have more than 40 hours, and can be considered for this exception.  Please let me know if you would like to approve each of these or not, and your justification.

By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus this spring before school lets out?  If not, let's definitely plan on scheduling a time during the coming fall 2001 semester when you can visit campus and present a lecture to my risk management students.

"RE: Proto letter to Paul Q for your input","Mike,

Perhaps it makes sense to shorten it a bit. I think the highlighted paragraphs can be removed.
Makes no sense to sound too apologetic.

Another observation. I have just talked to Christian and suggested a conference call
Monday evening our time with Paul. You can mention this conference call  request to Paul.
The oservation: Christian may be smart
but he will one hell of a person to manage given his personality.

Vince, 

How about this to keep the peace?....

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Paul,

Vince and I were just closing the loop on the recent misunderstanding regarding a potential rotation of Christian Werner into the Research Group in Houston, and I wanted to drop you a brief note to assure you that although it is very common up here for intra-group transfers to occur, it is never done without the input, advice and consent from the current supervisor at the very inception.

The first response I had when Christian proposed the arrangement was (and I quote myself) ""What does Paul think of the idea?""  Christian properly responded that the whole idea would be contingent on finding and training a replacement meteorologist for the Sydney office and getting your buy-in that the move would be good for Mother Enron in totality.

It was only with that understanding that any conversations along those lines proceeded.  Christian showed me the modelling progress he had made (Vince was out of town for this and thus unaware of it), but, quite frankly, I was very impressed with his achievements. I can see how he has become a valuable asset to your efforts.

The way we left the matter when Christian returned to Australia was that he would propose the subject to you for any further action.

Then, before I even had an opportunity to update Vince upon his return on my discussions with Christian, Christian called Vince to get his ideas on the subject (My hours aren't as conducive to Houston-Sydney phone link-ups, but Vince is here late into the night).   Vince's first and immediate reaction to the idea was to set up a telephone conference with you before even proceeding with the concept.

That is what somehow triggered the misunderstanding, but while at the same time, clarified what was happening and alerted you to the situation.  

You have a great asset there in Christian, but be assured we're not poachers!

Hope this is the last beating the dead horse needs.

- Mike 

!

The Global Premier ForumforEnergy Trading & Risk  Management

 6th - 9th November  2001, Paris

 
Dear Mr Kaminski, 
 
I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again this year - brilliant!
 
I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.  
 
To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the (""technical"") topics that are already covered:

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured  contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001 speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)  would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else that has not been covered  yet.
 
I look forward to hearing  from you,

"RE: Christian","Paul,
 
I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from Christian in which he confirmed
that he approached the Research in Houston on his own. He did not
receive any encouragement from me and from Mike. I hope this closes this issue.
 
I can understand Christian's motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.
He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers
who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal 
relations in my group he could observe during his stay in Houston.
 
My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for Enron and how to develop his social
intelligence.
 
 
Vince

Thank you for the clarification -  this is not the case presented to me by Christian and he has been obtuse to the point of deception with regard to this matter.
This lead to my conclusion that Houston was poaching and hence my blunt email to you - I apologise.
I am still sick but will call you next week to discuss the correct way of moving forward.

Paul,
 
I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues.
 
1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)
    last Friday, as far as I can remember.
 
    Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:
       a. We would be delighted to have him here.
       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives
           your blessing before we can move ahead.
    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and
    Mike Roberts.
 
  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you
      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and 
      asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was
      told you were out sick.
 
 3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next
     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.
 
 4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to
     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not 
     bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.
 
     I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the
     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.
 
I hope it helps. Cheers.
 
 
Vince

I have spoken to Christian and explained to him that he is critical to our local operations and should provide 100% focus on his role here.  As a small office it would be devestating for us should Christian be lured away.  I would appreciate you calling me rather than working through Christian on this matter.

Dear Vince,

I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he
interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am
wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after the
graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me any
longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment and
all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired
at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not quite
what I expected.

Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting
position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact
with the right people? I would really appreciate it.

Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).
Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Helen Demianenko.

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @Energy2.1. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email.    Please see below for more information
regarding this new release..

FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of @ENERGY/ErgLib. The
accompanying documentation contains installation and other information.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been
implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and
Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT,
OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all
models.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.6.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.
If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of possible
backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo,
Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional
details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.5.

@ENERGY (Basics)
European options  and strips of European options now support valuation via a
jump diffusion model (see OPT and STRIPOPT functions). Average price options
(see the APO, SPREADAPO, CRACKAPO functions), and average strike options
(see the ASO, SPREADASO functions) now allow for a direct input of the
fixing dates.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
 Includes two new functions, OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation
of complex compound options.

If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of backward
compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and
Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.4.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
	@ENERGY (Forward Curve) is the new module which includes functions designed
to generate forward curves, volatility curves and mean reversion rates used
in many other @ENERGY functions. Module in beta release.

@ENERGY (Basics)
	APO's and ASO's: bug fixed when avg_starts < opt_expiry, and num_fixings=1.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
	No change.

@ENERGY (Weather)
	Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided.

@ENERGY (Swing)
	Pay_at_end with strips: previously implemented was pay at end of  all
periods. Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod. . Module still in
beta release.

	Bug fixes:
1)	if max_const=min_const and max_const in not a multiple of the maximum
daily amount (in previous version min_const was disregarded in this case).
2)	in strip with global constraints: if allowed number of swings per period
changes (currently this can only be due to calendar effects).
3)	strip at index: index was incorrectly evaluated after first sub_period.

New Excel Templates
	The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added:

powercalib.xls	examples of generating @ENERGY parameters for power.

Add-in Manager
Now supports function help. If template is open with the Add-in manager and
function help is requested through the manager, the relevant portion of the
documentation get displayed.

Your input into the refinement of this product is welcome and greatly
appreciated. Any comments or suggestions may be sent to support@fea.com

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

   Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press. Hopefully,
   this
   has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.  The
   title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting notices.
   If
   you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this toward
   the
   attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have something
   to
   provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
   appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is
   needed
   as soon as possible. Please advise.
   Thank you.

A reminder: this column serves two objectives. The firstis introduction of  
new members of the Research Group, and of the associates andsummer interns  
rotating through the group. The second objective is to reviewinteresting  
publications related to energy markets, quantitative finance andother topics  
of interest to the Enron audience. I have run out of the newmembers to  
introduce and it's time to some real work. 

Today's column is devoted to the issue of technicalanalysis. Financial  
economists tend to dismiss technical analysis (chartism) asvoodoo science.  
Over the last few years, however, a significant amount ofevidence that  
technical analysis works at least in some markets. A paperpublished recently  
by Carol Osler of Federal Reserve Bank of New York (CurrencyOrders and  
Exchange-Rate Dynamics: Explaining the Success of Technical Analysis)reviews  
two cases in which technical analysis proved quite successful inoffering  
useful predictions in the foreign currency markets. The firstprediction is  
that trends tend to be reversed at identifiable support orresistance levels.  
The second is that if a support or resistance level isbreached, trends tend  
to accelerate. 

The explanation of this success can be found, according toCarol Osler, in the  
microstructure of the F/X market: take-profit and stop-lossorders tend to  
cluster around certain typical levels (like exchange rate endingin a specific  
market at 00 or 50 level). For example, the author found thatthat roughly  
2.8% of all stop-loss buy orders are triggered when the rate hitsa round  
number, while 10.5% of take profit sales orders are triggered. Thisasymmetry  
explains the success of the first prediction of technical analysis. Asecond  
asymmetry is related to clustering of orders just above and just belowround  
numbers ending in 50 and 00. Stop-loss buy orders are infrequent at ratesjust  
below these levels, and cluster above these levels. Stop-loss sell  
orders,however, cluster just below 00 and 50 levels a relatively scarce at  
rates justabove these levels.  

The question remains, why conditional orders tend tocluster at certain  
levels. One possibility is cognitive advantage tradersderive from managing  
large volume of information using simplified rules.Another possibility is  
that they follow recommendations of technical analysisin managing their  
books. In this case, technical analysis becomes aself-fulfilling prophecy. 

Please, contact us for thecopy of the paper if this caught your attention.

Vince,
You may have already thought about this, but I thought it was an interesting way to look at the problem.

The Mirage of a Growing Fuel Supply  
By EVAR D. NERING  
COTTSDALE, Ariz. - When I discussed the exponential function in the first-semester calculus classes that I taught, I invariably used consumption of a nonrenewable natural resource as an example. Since we are now engaged in a national debate about energy policy, it may be useful to talk about the mathematics involved in making a rational decision about resource use.  
In my classes, I described the following hypothetical situation. We have a 100-year supply of a resource, say oil - that is, the oil would last 100 years if it were consumed at its current rate. But the oil is consumed at a rate that grows by 5 percent each year. How long would it last under these circumstances? This is an easy calculation; the answer is about 36 years.  
Oh, but let's say we underestimated the supply, and we actually have a 1,000-year supply. At the same annual 5 percent growth rate in use, how long will this last? The answer is about 79 years.  
Then let us say we make a striking discovery of more oil yet - a bonanza - and we now have a 10,000-year supply. At our same rate of growing use, how long would it last? Answer: 125 years.  
Estimates vary for how long currently known oil reserves will last, though they are usually considerably less than 100 years. But the point of this analysis is that it really doesn't matter what the estimates are. There is no way that a supply-side attack on America's energy problem can work.  
The exponential function describes the behavior of any quantity whose rate of change is proportional to its size. Compound interest is the most commonly encountered example - it would produce exponential growth if the interest were calculated at a continuing rate. I have heard public statements that use ""exponential"" as though it describes a large or sudden increase. But exponential growth does not have to be large, and it is never sudden. Rather, it is inexorable.  
Calculations also show that if consumption of an energy resource is allowed to grow at a steady 5 percent annual rate, a full doubling of the available supply will not be as effective as reducing that growth rate by half - to 2.5 percent. Doubling the size of the oil reserve will add at most 14 years to the life expectancy of the resource if we continue to use it at the currently increasing rate, no matter how large it is currently. On the other hand, halving the growth of consumption will almost double the life expectancy of the supply, no matter what it is.  
This mathematical reality seems to have escaped the politicians pushing to solve our energy problem by simply increasing supply. Building more power plants and drilling for more oil is exactly the wrong thing to do, because it will encourage more use. If we want to avoid dire consequences, we need to find the political will to reduce the growth in energy consumption to zero - or even begin to consume less.  
I must emphasize that reducing the growth rate is not what most people are talking about now when they advocate conservation; the steps they recommend are just Band-Aids. If we increase the gas mileage of our automobiles and then drive more miles, for example, that will not reduce the growth rate.  
Reducing the growth of consumption means living closer to where we work or play. It means telecommuting. It means controlling population growth. It means shifting to renewable energy sources.  
It is not, perhaps, necessary to cut our use of oil, but it is essential that we cut the rate of increase at which we consume it. To do otherwise is to leave our descendants in an impoverished world.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
Enron impact takes its toll, FI lenders scrips plunge on bourses, Sharad Mistry & Laxmikant Khanvilkar 

THREE major financial institutions - ICICI, IDBI and IFCI - are witnessing an increased selling wave on the bourses over the past few trading sessions, thanks to their collective exposure in the controversial Enron-promoted $3 billion Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The total exposure in DPC of these FIs, and a few banks like the State Bank of India and Canara Bank, including foreign currency guarantees, works out to over Rs 5,500 crore. Little wonder, therefore, that investors fear more red ink splashed over the balance sheets of the FIs and are hurrying to move out of their investments in these FIs. 

The stock prices of all the three FIs have been sliding. While the stock price of IDBI and IFCI have touched new lows of Rs 16 and Rs 2.90, respectively, that of ICICI is still holding at around Rs 50-55 levels. Early this month, IDBI was quoted at Rs 19.90, IFCI at Rs 3.60 and ICICI at Rs 59.30. ICICI, however, had touched Rs 51 on August 9, a new low from previous levels. This clearly indicates that, plagued by the rising share of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total assets of all the three FIs, the share prices of these FIs have came under severe pressure. 

Analysts tracking the banking and FI counters say that the sliding trend is feared to be continued over the days and weeks ahead, especially because of the tightening of the non-performing assets guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Moreover, the kind of trading activity witnessed at these counters is alarming. While the volume of share trade is substantial, there is a sharp fall in the stock prices of these stocks. Quite clearly, these are no good indicators, at least for the time being. However, these companies disbursal/approvals to DPC are well within the stipulated RBI norms, i.e., 15 per cent of total disbursal/ approvals. 

For example, ICICI's gross NPL as of March 2001, stands at a whopping Rs 5,988 crore. Power sector leads the approval and disbural list of ICICI at Rs 6,424 crore and Rs 2,400 crore, respectively. Its exposure in the power sector, which stood at Rs 8,531 crore or 11 per cent of the total exposure of Rs 77,279 crore, has been on the decline. Last year they stood at 11.6 per cent of Rs 65,495 crore. On the other hand, IDBI's stock price is on the slide since the beginning of this month. It is currently quoting at Rs 16. The counter is experiencing heavy volumes with daily volumes being in the range of 35,000 plus. The situation is worse for IFCI which is quoting below par for quite sometime now. Further, the scrip has been losing steam since August 2, when it was quoting at Rs 4. Currently, it is quoting below Rs 3.

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
FIs initiate search for buyers for Enron stake, Samik Dasgupta & Soma Banerjee 

THE SEARCH for getting a buyer for Enron's equity in the Dabhol power project has started with financial institutions initiating discussions with potential buyers. FIs have been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing a roadmap for Enron's exit and finding a solution to pending MSEB payments. The first job for FIs is to determine the actual cost required to complete the Dabhol project. Although, about 96 per cent of the project is complete, the stoppage of work for the past few weeks has led to cancellation of contracts and possibilities of the cost escalating. With Enron having already announced its unwillingness to pump in additional resources, the new investor will not only have to pay for the equity but also fund the project's completion. Speaking to ET, finance secretary Ajit Kumar said: ""FIs have been told to work out details about the prices that each of the interested buyer can offer for the Dabhol project. Since it is totally buyer driven, FIs will have to take this into account while holding their discussions with the potential buyers. Enron may demand any price but there have to be takers for that too.'' Tata Power, Hindujas and some other leading industrial houses are interested in buying out Enron. FIs are going to talk individually to all the interested companies, and the equity will be sold to the highest bidder, Kumar said. 

According to FI sources involved with the Dabhol negotiations several angles are being looked into as the matter is now complicated with Enron invoking legal provisions. ""The aim is to work out an out- of-court settlement to the issue. Valuation is not an issue as the project has a 25-year life cycle,'' an official said. FI sources claimed that their role is that of a facilitator where they will try and bring the buyer and seller at a common point.FIs are also discussing with the Centre if it is possible for them to get a cover for the second phase of the project. As of now, the first phase of the project has been given the counter-guarantee while the promoters are pushing for a similar cover to ensure payments.

Dabhol dispute unfortunate: Govt

THE GOVERNMENT on Monday described the dispute over the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Project as an `unfortunate' experience in foreign investment in the country's infrastructure sector. ``Enron is a very unfortunate episode in our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial infrastructure sector and I wish it had never happened,'' minister of state for external affairs, Omar Abdullah said here. Nevertheless, the country's judiciary has decided a large number of cases in Enron's favour thereby proving its fair and independent nature, he added. Speaking after launching the Confederation of Indian Industries International, the international arm of the chamber, he said Indian industry has had enough protection and should not ask for more. ``Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping new markets abroad, our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its potential,'' Abdullah said.Indian missions abroad have to realise that their role is changing, he said it is now clear that economic diplomacy is integral to foreign policy and a key determinant of a country's political and strategic influence. He said the ministry of external affairs had also started working on these lines and would make every possible effort to provide necessary support to the country's business chambers and industry to position itself as a global player in the emerging global scenario.

THE Centre has called the Enron-promoted Dabhol power project controversy as an 'unfortunate' experience. ""Enron is a very unfortunate episode in our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial infrastructure sector and I wish it had never happened,"" minister of state for external affairs Omar Abdullah said here on Monday. Nevertheless, the country's judiciary has decided a large number of cases in Enron's favour, thereby, proving its fair and independent nature, he said, while launching Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) international arm, 'CII International (CIII)'. Stating that there is no alternative to globalisation, Mr Abdullah said, ""Indian industry has had enough protection and should not ask for more."" ""Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping new markets abroad, our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its potential,"" he added. The new outfit, CIII, created to facilitate the process of internationalisation of domestic companies, will have a budget of Rs 50 crore, which is almost 50 per cent of the Confederation's total budget, CII president Sanjiv Goenka said. 

Institutionalisation of CIII is part of the value addition exercise of the Confederation to accelerate the process of globalisation, he said, adding that CII will leverage its 191 partners in 92 countries to the process. CIII will be headed by Arun Bharat Ram. Piyush Bahal has been appointed head of the CIII secretariat. Speaking on the occasion, Arun Bharat Ram said, ""CIII will take proactive initiatives to enhance the country's share in international trade."" He said that CII already has a dedicated WTO cell to facilitate the process of internationalisation of domestic companies. Write to the Editor

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
Power Play (Editorial)

With emotions running high over the Dabhol issue, Enron chairman Kenneth Lay understandably showed great alacrity in denying reports that he has threatened India with sanctions. In a letter to prime minister A B Vajpayee, Mr Lay clarified that Enron has not asked the US government to take any such action, and ""is far from suggesting that we have decided to pursue these mechanisms"". Fair enough. But are the remarks as innocuous as Enron is making them out to be? Consider the facts. In the course of the controversial interview, Mr Lay said that if Enron was ""squeezed'' to accept less than the cost incurred by it on building the power plant, that would amount to ""expropriation"" by the Indian government. He added, for good measure, that US laws prevent Washington from assisting countries which expropriate the property of American companies. Significantly, an Enron team is slated to negotiate with Indian lenders this week. One of the proposals doing the rounds is that the financial institutions (FIs) buy out Enron's stake in Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and `warehouse' the shares till they can find another buyer. The FIs, on their part, have indicated their willingness to slash interest rates on the loans to DPC in a bid to make the project viable. But they're not willing to be the only ones to make a sacrifice. So, they're expected to ask Enron to accept a discount of 25 to 35 per cent on its asking price. The bargaining is likely to be tough, and savvy negotiators routinely try to `psyche' the opposition beforehand. Mr Lay is known to be close to the Bush administration. In the light of all this, is the timing of his remarks pure coincidence? 

Mr Lay, of course, has his own compulsions. While the Dabhol imbroglio has undoubtedly hurt India, Enron's armour is not without some chinks  which Indian negotiators would do well to note. The company faces accusations, which it denies, that it manipulated power prices in California. Its share price has fallen more than 55 per cent since the start of the year, and chief executive officer Jeffrey Skilling recently quit abruptly, forcing Mr Lay to take over the CEO's job as well. Unfortunately, Indian negotiators are unlikely to use what should be their trump card  the Godbole Committee's observation that the Dabhol deal was a failure of governance at every step of the decision-making process. Because doing so could embarrass too many prominent people on both ends of the political spectrum. Even so, the Indian side should hang tough. There have been suggestions that the LNG plant be spun off as a separate power centre, Enron let out its harbour facilities to other LNG importers, and the foreign currency loans be converted into rupee loans. These could form the basis of a fair deal that would allow both India and Enron to move on from the mess they have landed in. Hopefully, the Dabhol debacle will also send out warning signals to both Indian politicians and multinationals about the perils of non-transparent, negotiated deals, as opposed to a genuinely free market. If it does, and if India gets its act together on power sector reforms, we may yet see some light at the end of the long, long tunnel.

Enron denies seeking sanctions over Dabhol, Sanjay Dutta 

US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washington seeking sanctions against India over the dispute with the Maharashtra government over the $2.9 billion Dabhol power project, even as domestic financial institutions hinted at increasing their exposure in the project by about $483 million (Rs 2,270 crore) for its completion. In a letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday, a copy of which was available with The Times of India, Enron CEO Kenneth said: ""A recent story in the Financial Times, which mischaracterised discussions with me, appears to have caused significant, unintended concern. Counter to the impression given in the story, I have not asked anyone in the US government to consider imposing sanctions."" 

Lay said in his letter that Enron's approach was to settle the issue amicably by selling its stake. ""Furthermore, I did not say that the Dabhol power plant had been expropriated. Upon questioning from the publicator (publisher) I did factually explained the several possible options available, including how one might get to expropriation and about the US laws in place to protect its businesses. However, that is far from suggesting that we have decided to pursue these mechanisms,"" Lay said. ""Our preferred approach approach continues to be to resolve this issue amicably by selling our stake to Indian governmental and financial institutions,"" Lay said. 

However, Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding, ""Without agreement on that, we have little choice but to follow the termination procedures jointly agreed under the power purchase agreement."" Lay also sent copies of the letter to finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabhu. PTI ADDS: The IDBI-led FIs' consortium may increase their exposure to enable the project to be completed and negotiate Daphol Power Company's equity at a 25 per cent discount to its face value. The FIs are exploring a possibility of taking out offshore equity by investment institutions and utilities after 12-18 months from Phase-II completion, the report said.

 If this proposal was accepted by the joint committee of the FIs, then IDBI's revised exposure would be at Rs 2,742 crore from existing Rs 2,121 crore, ICICI Rs 1,904 crore from Rs 1,473 crore, SBI Rs 2,261 crore from Rs 1,749 crore, IFCI Rs 587 crore from Rs 454 crore and Canara Bank Rs 526 crore from Rs 407 crore. ""Even in the best case, the exposure requirements from domestic institutions exceed the prudential exposure norms,"" the report quoted FI sources as saying. Subsequent participation by all other FIs and banks like IDFC, PFC, PNB, Union Bank, Bank of India among others would be accrued through syndication. FIs may also seek a guarantee from the Centre as a backup for their exposure, the report quoted the sources as saying. Last week, the FIs had made a presentation to the finance ministry on a possible bailout package for Dabhol. The proposals envisage concessions from stakeholders, around 22.38 per cent concessional duty on the energy major's liquefied natural gas plant, a mega power project status and offset of custom duties on LNG supply.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
'Enron has not discussed Dabhol with Bush', Vidyadhar Date 

Enron has denied that it had approached the U.S. government in an effort to obtain sanctions against India in its dispute over the Dabhol power project. The denial came in the wake of a report in the Financial Times of Thursday which carried an interview with Enron chairperson Kenneth Lay. The report quoted Mr Lay as saying there are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government from providing any aid or assistance to India if it expropriated properties of U.S. companies. An Enron spokesperson said Mr Lay had not discussed the Dabhol dispute with President George Bush. 

Meanwhile, the legal tussle between energy activists, the Maharashtra government and Enron continues in India. The state government is preparing a fresh affidavit with strong arguments against Enron in the case filed in the supreme court by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), which is the labour wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and activist Abhay Mehta against the Dabhol project. The affidavit will make a strong case against Enron unlike the previous statement filed by the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP dominated state administration which was seen to be favourable to the controversial multinational. 

The case has been pending in the supreme court for the past four years and since then major changes have taken place on the Enron front with more and more evidence emerging against the project. The government will rely substantially on the M.D. Godbole committee report which found a number of infirmities in the project and expressed serious concern over the irregularities. In the petition, CITU and Abhay Mehta, author of the book Power Play, which gives a detailed account of the the Enron drama, have challenged the clearance given to the project by the Central Electricity Authority. They argued that since the project had been renegotiated, it required a fresh review by the CEA. They described as false the claim of the previous government that by holding renegotiations it had secured a good deal with lower tariff. 

Anti-Enron activists feel that their stand has been vindicated by the recent setbacks received by the company. Regarding the explosion in Enron's Teeside plant in England which left three workers dead, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, energy activist, said Enron should have prepared a disaster management plan for the Dabhol plant.Enron suffered a serious setback last week with the resignation of chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, the drastic fall in stocks and the explosion in the Teeside plant. Mr Kenneth Lay, the company's chairperson, is now trying to limit the damage by travelling in the U.S., explaining the events to company divisions and trying to improve sentiment on Wall Street. While Enron wants to exit from its operations in India, it is also reported to be trying to wind up the wind turbine manufacturing business Activists are also encouraged by protests against privatisation of electricity being voiced in other parts of the world. Anti-privatisation activists invaded the legislature building in the Brazilian state of Parana last week, protesting against the move to privatise the state's electric generation, transmission and distribution utility.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
EGM's global crude and products group closed its largest trades to date with EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EOT) on June 29,2001.  Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. (""EGLI"") is the counterparty to a 10-year toll conversion agreement and a 10-year storage capacity agreement that also provides transportation.  The toll conversion agreement calls for EGLI to deliver a combination of feedstocks (methanol, natural gas, and normal butane) to be converted into various offtake products, primarily MTBE. 

As a part of the 10-year conversion agreement, EGLI has the option to convert the facility into an Iso Octane plant.  The option to convert is EGLI's sole and exclusive right.  In addition, the call helps to mitigate the regulatory risk associated with the MTBE market.

Prior to the close of the 10-year conversion and storage capacity agreements, Enron's corporate development group organized the sale of the hydrocarbon-processing complex in Morgan's Point, Texas, and a liquids pipeline grid system to EOTT for approximately $120 million.  The asset sale was predicated on the agreements to be entered into between EGLI and EOTT.  

These combined agreements represent EGM's largest transaction to date.

EGM Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals welcomes Andrew Hill to the Houston office for a six-month assignment from London.  Andrew joined EGM in March as a Senior Specialist and has been instrumental in developing the growing range of EGM Fundamentals publications such as Critical Mass and The Week Ahead.  In Houston, Andrew will be working with Richard Lassander to manage analysis of the crude and products markets.  Prior to joining EGM, Andrew worked as a management consultant specializing in Latin America with Wood McKenzie.

EGM Fundamentals has begun analysis of domestic freight markets.  This new effort, managed by Jeff Andrews, is being coordinated with Matt Arnold's forward trading group in Enron Freight Markets (EFM).  Current analysis is focused on over-the-road trucking, following the initial commercial focus of EFM, and the development of diesel hedging strategies.  Related projects include modeling the seasonality of trucking demand and diesel fuel consumption and forecasting on-road diesel prices.  Within the next three to four weeks, analysis will begin of the intermodal freight network.  Interested parties should watch the EGM Fundamentals intranet site (<http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com>) for updates.

East Power Origination
The Sand Hill Energy Center in Austin was dedicated on Wednesday, July 11th at 10:00 am.  The $93.7 million project is the first peaking facility of its kind in Texas to be constructed with selective catalytic reduction pollution control equipment that reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission rate by 80 percent.  NOx emissions from the units are 5 parts per million (ppm), which is considerably less than the amounts allowed by state and federal regulations.  Congratulations to the development team!

IN THE NEWS

""For California to continue this bogus claim of $8.9 billion, I think just shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. ""They are just interested in creating a whipping post. The last thing that the political leadership in California wants to do is take responsibility for the problem they created.""

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany 
Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first physical supply contract with an industrial customer.  The customer, based in Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be taking gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base load.

In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team completed a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbent player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside Germany in order to close the gas supply deal.  ""Although we are happy that we have successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contractual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four network operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the negotiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transport from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France,"" commented Carsten Haack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke and Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important element of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first transportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after Ruhrgas. ""This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, especially in East Germany, "" said Haack. ""But more importantly, this deal will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to customers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!"" he added.

ETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont
Congratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL) for signing a series of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wilton International.

A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two million tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plants. New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies, and for the provision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance, security and emergency response.

Paul Gavens, CEO of ETOL, said: ""Securing an exclusive long-term supply agreement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achievement for ETOL. The new arrangements extend the terms of our current contract for steam and power to 2010, restructure the pricing arrangements and offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the operation of their respective assets.""


Enron's Northernmost Partner!
Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Varanger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partnership will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperature risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian market generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.

This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationships in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varanger has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in cooperation with Russian partners to manage the water storage.

Dilbert Newsletter 39.0
-----------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   December 2001



Highlights
-------------------------------------------------
* New DNRC Word
* Boss and Cow-orker quotes
* Plop Version 2.0
* True Tales of Induhviduals
* My Holiday Message
-------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

The 400,000 members of DNRC continue to get smarter and better
looking every day. Case in point: I am typing this newsletter using
telekinesis while watching CNN in an adjoining room. And if I'm not
mistaken, Paula Zahn is trying to flirt with me.


New DNRC Word
-------------

A DNRC member suggests this new word for Osama's terrorist
organization: Al-Qae-duh.

I would love to have been a fly in Osama's beard last year when he
was discussing his plan for global conquest.

Osama: ""I have an idea. Let's attack the most powerful
        nation in the history of the universe and then hide
        in caves.""

Omar:  ""All in favor, say eye!""

That might sound like a crazy plan to many of you, but you need to
realize that Osama grew up in Saudi Arabia where that sort of
strategy has worked in the past. In the November 12th issue of
Newsweek there's a ""Special Advertising Section"" where Saudi
Arabia's public relations firm describes the wonderful history of
Saudi Arabia. In 1901 a guy named Ibn Saud, along with his cousin
and 38 buddies, climbed over the fortress wall in Riyadh and waited
until the Amir came strolling by. Then Ibn and his cousin hacked
the Amir to death with swords. At this point in the story -- so you
don't think I'm making up this whole thing -- I quote from Saudi
Arabia's own P.R. article: ""The Riyadh garrison, demoralized by the
death of their leader, and fearing they faced a far larger force
than 40 men, surrendered.""

That's right; Ibn conquered a whole city with 40 men, of which 38
were just standing around watching. Eventually the Saud family
consolidated power, named the country after themselves and formed a
royal dynasty that is still in power. That's the inspirational
story that little Osama learned in school when he was growing up.

Who's crazy now?


True Quotes from Induhviduals
-----------------------------

Here are more true quotes submitted by DNRC members. Most of these
are from managers. As you will see, Induhviduals are confused by
anything involving critters or body parts.

""It's an exercise in fertility.""

""Hindsight is 50-50.""

""Just use your own excretion.""

""You are never going to fail unless you try.""

""We're scraping the bottom of the iceberg.""

""Today is like the day Rome was built in.  We can't afford to have
any fiddlers.""

""The project is going down the toilet in flames.""

""He might be barking at a red herring.""

""You're treading on thin water.""

I think he meant we should cross our T's and dot our I's but it
came out this way: ""Be sure we all cross our eyes.""

""He's as deaf as a bat.""

""We don't want to stick our necks out and get our asses chopped
off.""

""I gave him a real mouthful.""

""I really took the bull by the hands.""

""He doesn't know his hole from an ass in the ground.""

""You should talk to her. She is a minefield of information.""

""I can't remember but it's right on the tip of my head!""

""You can lead a pig to pearls..."" and then he trailed off.

""Thanksgiving is early this year because the first Thursday fell on
a Monday.""

""The skeleton is there. You just have to sharpen it and put the
decorations on the tree.""

And this last quote, which may or may not have come from Osama: ""We
need an escape goat.""


Plop Version 2.0
-----------------

In case you ever decide to start your own comic strip and you want
to solicit opinions from other people, let me give you this piece
of valuable advice. You should never -- and I mean NEVER -- give
the comic a name that rhymes with any of the following words:

Flop
Drop
Stop

That little rhyming opportunity was not lost on about two hundred
of you who thought Plop was not up to DNRC quality. Fortunately,
some people actually liked Plop. I read every comment and the
breakdown looks roughly like this:

Loved it:   33%
Liked it:   46% (thought it has potential)
Loathed it: 21%

That's a great response for a first draft of a comic. Comic strips
normally get developed for several months before the public sees
them. You're in on the ground floor.

Version 2.0 of Plop incorporates many of your comments. I renamed
Plop (because Plop was the name of a comic book in the past), I
changed Smokey's species, I made Plop more optimistic, I addressed
the hip-deep mud question and I started to fill out the
personalities of the main characters. Only a few people were
bothered by the physical similarity to the Taliban, so I'm not
going to let that bother me if the comic develops into something
worthwhile.

The new and improved strips are posted on the Web at
http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/ and begin with #21. All
comments and rhyming insults are appreciated.


Induhvidual Baby Names
----------------------

Here is further proof that all Induhviduals should be given the
same name to keep things simple.

--

A doctor friend of mine was on hand for a delivery in a maternity
unit.  The mother named her daughter Placenta.

--

I once knew a person with the tuneful name of Listerine.

--

My wife was a public social worker in South Carolina many years
ago. One of her case families had a daughter named Syphilis.  The
family pronounced it in two parts: Syph-Philis.  One day my wife
asked the mother how they came to name the child Syph Philis.  The
mother said the hospital named her, and she got a copy of the birth
certificate to prove it.

On the birth certificate was an annotation that the child was ""born
of a mother with syphilis."" The mother assumed the hospital had
named her child for her.

(Editor's note: That one sounds like an urban legend to me. Let me
know if you've heard it before.)


Saving the World
----------------

Here's a fun mental exercise. Try to think of any problem in the
world that wouldn't be reduced if we all did some extra shopping
this year.

How about terrorism? Let's see, if we shop a little extra, that
stimulates the economy, which increases tax collections, which pays
for more security. Ta-dah!

How about unemployment? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> more
hiring.

How about diseases? Shopping --> stimulated economy --> funding for
research.

So I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that buying Dilbert
merchandise will solve every problem in the world. But don't think
the burden falls entirely on you. I'll meet you halfway by listing
some suggestions.

- ""God's Debris"" - Ponder the collision of science and God

Things Not To Say in a Restroom
-------------------------------

I hope this doesn't spawn a new category, but these two reports
were worth mentioning.

--

As I entered the restroom, a cow-orker who had just finished his
business, turned to me and said, ""Oh, hey, Brent, I was just
thinking about you.""

--

At my last job, just as I was entering a restroom, a cow-orker
said, ""Say, can I grab you when you're done?""



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

One of the young ladies in our office is getting ready for her
""dream"" vacation to Mount Rushmore. My colleague asked her to bring
him back a picture of the other side of the mountain. When she
asked why, he proceeded to convince her that on the other side of
Mount Rushmore are the backs of the presidents, on their knees,
with their heads stuck into the mountain. She is so excited that
she is going to look for a special tour of the backside.

--

I went to a home improvement store to buy a new faucet for my
kitchen sink. I did not see the particular model I had in mind, so
I asked one of the Induhvidual employees for assistance.

He said, ""We stopped selling that model because it was the number
one theft item in the store."" I waited to hear the punchline, until
I realized he was serious.

I might have to find a new home improvement store if they ever
achieve their goal of carrying no products worth stealing.

--

During a round of layoffs at the company, a farewell card for one
unfortunate cow-orker was circulated. People were signing the card
with ""good luck!"" and ""Been great working with you"" and so on.
When the card got to the desk of one manager, he did not bother to
read the card.  He just wrote ""Happy Birthday"" and signed his name.

--

A pool hall put up a sign in their front window that read:
""Profound language prohibited within."" I could just imagine some
people discussing the meaning of life and being told to take it
outside.

--

While traveling on business in Norfolk, Nebraska, I noticed a
Ramada Inn sign:

        ""Plan your next affair here""

The next day the sign was taken down.

--

At a business lunch, platters of calamari were passed down the
tables. As a platter reached one of the employee's wives, she was
heard to remark during an unfortunate lull in the conversation,
""No, thanks. I never eat anything with testicles attached.""

The stricken silence lasted a few moments. Then 150 people lost it.


--

I work in a camera store.  An Induhvidual came in and said his
camera wasn't working and asked me if I could look at it.  I agreed
and said I would check the battery first.  The Induhvidual said,
""I've had this battery for five years and I've never had any
problems with it before.""

I changed the battery and the camera worked.


--

I would like to shove a live bear cub up my boss's nose and then
have the mother bear go after him whenever he opens a phone
conversation with, ""Hi buddy how's it going yeah me too!""

--

My boss was having a discussion with another employee about some
work rules that pertain to people doing manual labor.  He said
these rules don't apply to us because we don't use manuals.

--

Yesterday my boss called me and said, ""Effective immediately, I
want you to stop your current activity and start working on this
new area."" When I asked specifically what I was supposed to do, he
replied: ""It was not my intention to give you a task today, just a
mind-set!""


My Holiday Message
------------------

I've written and rewritten this section a dozen times. My problem
is that no matter how much I write, I keep condensing it down to
the same thought: This holiday season, as we laugh and eat and shop
and enjoy friends and family, our soldiers are in Afghanistan
risking everything for us. Some of them won't come back. The rest
will never be the same.

Every one of them volunteered. They think we're worth it.

Let's prove them right.



Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Hi Vince,
 
I hope all is well with you.  I sure miss  working together with you and Mike. 
 
I thought you would want to know about this site:  www.structurallogic.com << File: http://www.structurallogic.com >>    
 
I have found it to be quite accurate,  and useful for both short and long-term technical analysis on the  markets.  Your son
may find it interesting, as well.
 
Take care,
Tricia  Tlapek

The NY ISO posts hourly tie flows for the previous month (and earlier).  That would provide an excellent opportunity for calibration.  Once field proven, such monitoring would be useful.  ERCOT tie flows are not generally posted (only very much after the fact), and even for NY, the data is out only after the month is over.  I think there would be great value for this info just in North America, not to mention other systems.

Greetings Vince!
	During the brief idle moments we have here in the lab, I have been pondering yet another possible project.  We have built sensor boards and written programs to calculate the current flow along High Voltage Direct Current lines, the type that form the Western Inter-tie.    There are six of these lines to the west, i.e. to the WSCC  - four between WSCC and MAPP and two between WSCC and SPP.  It would seem to me to be valuable to know when there there power supply differences between these NERC regions and when power was flowing between them.  (In this case, directionality is no problem.  For once there is actually something flowing!)  Of course if this is useful, the project could expand to other inter-regional zones.  HVDC lines exist in the northeast between the large Canadian hydro projects and the metropolitan cities in New England.  Globally, there are several large grids being formed - one in Scandinavia, one in North Africa, an East Russian/Chinese system and a Russian/Korean/Japanese system.  Naturally these have to connect internally with DC lines as there are power frequency, power reliability and power control differences between each of the generating countries.
	You are the first person that I have told about this.  I didn't want to get anyone, especially my immediate supervisors, excited about a technology that I wasn't ready to provide.  I know that once I say that we could do it, the powers that be will want it NOW.  If you think that there is a market for this imformation I'll sneak out some weekend and collect a bit of data.  The nearest HVDC inter-tie is just north of Dallas so testing it would only take a day or two.  I am currently juggling two running chainsaws, a rabid dog and three vial of hepatitis so one more item in the mix won't make much of a difference at this point.  If no one needs to info, I'll just put the hardware and software on the shelf.

p.s.  Gina and I would like to take you out to lunch or dinner soon to a Sardinian restaurant.  Let us know when you would be free.  ( Your wife is invited, of course!)

Above normal though not excessive temperatures expected for most areas through the end of the week and beyond. Tropical wave in the Caribbean has become more organized over the past 24 hours.***  The ridge in the Plains and building East looks quite strong to me. In an ordinary August, this should have more triple digit heat than we are seeing. The humidity and associated heat indices are more than making up for this. Consistent rain from earlier in the summer seem to be still having an impact on temperatures. The only shower activity of note this morning is in the Upper Midwest with a weak cold front pressing down from Canada. This will reach the NE by the weekend, but cooling will be less dramatic than recent episodes. There will be some subtle sh! ifts with the Plains ridge, but not a huge effect on sensible weather. A weak monsoonal flow continues in the West, especially the SW. We also have a trough supplying cool air for the NW. This trough should weaken considerably late in the period with signs the Plains ridge expands into the West.   As for the tropics, I still see a potential for ""Barry"" to form late this week in the Southern Gulf. The wave from this in the Caribbean looks healthier today. Rains from this will spread into the Southern half of Florida today. The hurricane models have been run on this system and one of the intensity indicators predict a minimal hurriczane by Friday. I caution that to be way overblown considering we dont have a storm as of yet. The environment should be more favorable once the system passes by Cuba tonight. Most of the models have a landfall of some type early next week in Southern Texas or Northern Mexico.  Tomorrow: Thursday, August  2, 2001   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

There is no other model support for this at this time and it is my opinion that those forecasts will bust in a big way. Now, having said that, there is some support for the ridge to shift West temporarily into the Rockies. That often results in a trough in the NE which is climatologically favored. I just think the magnitude of the MRF is way overdone. I am maintaining earlier forecasts of largely above normal temperatures East of the Rockies until further evidence indicates otherwise. At the same time, the West may start to share in the warmth, though the set up still does not favor heat getting to the coastal communities.

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

Hi Vince,

How are you? I will be back in Houston for December break as well as the

month of January. If the group is in need of any help, I will be more than

happy to work with or without pay in the month of January.

Hope to hear from you soon.

"FW: 7/30 Prediction meeting","
Norman,

Thanks for your message. I treat the Monday 
meeting as the opportunity to introduce Enron to Prediction
Company and to inform you about Enron's trading operation
and especially about our electronic trading platforms.
The exchange of information will hopefully lead to future 
collaboration. We are especially interested in working with
you on improving the algorithms that support our electronic market
making functions (automatic adjustments of the price levels and/or bid-offer
spreads to the changing market conditions). My group has currently
a research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantage
of some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.

I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity markets
and we can explore other possibilities as well. Given the exploratory character
of the first meeting, it probably makes sense if Prediction Company 
participation is limited to you and Jim. We shall, of course, be glad to meet
with other associates that you may decide to bring to Houston with you. We shall be also
glad to visit your company if we both decide to continue our discussions after the first meeting.

Enron side will be represented by Greg Whalley,  President & COO of Enron Wholesale Services,
and myself. We expect John Lavorato, a member of EWS senior executive team, and
my colleague from London, Dr. Steve Leppard, to join us. Shirley is forwarding the agenda and some
additional information to you tonight.

You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail addres: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home
(281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396. I look forward to meeting
you on Sunday.

Vince,

I wanted to clear up a few points about the meeting next Monday, to make it
as efficient as possible.

Re. Scope:

We are particularly interested in hearing your vision of how Prediction
Company might be able to contribute to your electronic market business.  In
doing some background reading on the niche of electronic energy markets, we
can imagine various roles we might play, but we need a more concrete vision
from you to anchor our thoughts.

If you have other major issues to cover, you could let us know, and it might
shape the roster of participants from our side.


Re. Participants:

On your side, Shirley has indicated two people, you and Greg Whalley (for at
least part of the meeting?).

Definite participants from our side are:
- Norman Packard (me) CEO.
- Jim Nusbaum, CTO, also directing new business exploration.

We could consider bringing others, depending on where we expect the
discussion to go, e.g. deeply into research issues or deeply into business
issues.  Do you have a suggestion here?


Re. Agenda:

Agenda contributions from our side could be:

NP:  Overview of Prediction Company, history, business model, contractual
situation, finances.  If desirable, I could also provide an overview of
research.

JN:  Overview of Prediction Company's existing technology, future
directions, and development potential


Re. schedule:

I will definitely be in town to meet with you for dinner Sunday evening,
7:30 at Brennan's.  I will touch base with others re. fitting Sunday dinner
into their schedules, and confirm with Shirley.  We assume the same plan for
the meeting Monday morning, 9:00 at your offices on 1400 Smith St.

Thanks again for stimulating this meeting!

    Best regards,
    Norman

PS  Shirley: thanks for sending the CD.

Vince and Stinson,

I did some reserach on the option visualization.  Here is one of the findings.

Check this web site, the image looks impressive:  http://home.online.no/~espehaug/VirtualWorld/VirtualOptionWorld.html
This is done through a free software LiveGraphics3D and Mathematica. 

Take a look of the demo on the web site mentioned above to see if it is good enough for our purpose.


Zimin








PS:

What Is LiveGraphics3D? 

     LiveGraphics3D is a non-commercial Java 1.1 applet to display and
     rotate three-dimensional graphics produced by Mathematica in
     HTML pages. It may be used without charge for any
     non-commercial purposes. Mathematica is a program for symbolic
     and numeric mathematics by Wolfram Research, Inc.. Wolfram
     Research is also responsible for licensing LiveGraphics3D for
     commercial purposes. 

     LiveGraphics3D enables all Mathematica users to put almost any
     three-dimensional graphics computed by Mathematica directly onto
     a HTML page, such that everyone with a web browser supporting
     Java 1.1 (e.g. Communicator 4.0 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher)
     can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional
     software. 

     Additionally LiveGraphics3D is able to show animations, calculate
     stereo graphics, integrate hyperlinks, and display bitmap
     backgrounds. 

Jim,

Current headcount of the group is 49, including assistants, associates and
analysts, and  part-time employees. The core group head count is 36 professionals.

I am attaching a spreadsheet that gives you  affiliation of each employee with the primary
unit he/she supports. Some people support multiple units but I ignore such details.

What is shown below are the percentage cost allocations to different Enron units.
The allocations are based on the averages from the last year and will apply to 2002.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman  
Sent:	Tuesday, November 13, 2001 6:18 PM
To:	DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide2
Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Today's focus: Panda: Virus authors getting trickier

By Jason Meserve


I got a couple of interesting items in my inbox this week. The
first was an antivirus vendor press release doing the annual
look-back-at-last-year and look-forward-to-this-year pitch.

The Panda Software release says virus authors are getting more
tricky in their attempts to spread viruses, using social
engineering techniques to get unsuspecting users to open their
malicious wares. Panda is hoping that 2002 will not be a repeat
of 2001, when a number of simple ""bait"" messages caused mass
mailing viruses to spread like wildfire.

Panda also suspects that viruses in 2002 will go after known
system exploits like buffer overflows to run code on infected
machines. Users are urged to keep systems and antivirus
software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. Sounds
like common sense to me. For more, go to:
http://www.pandasoftware.com/

The second item was an e-mail alert sent around by the authors
of the SiliconValley.com newsletter warning that their systems
had been hacked and used to send messages infected with
Magistr.B virus. Not good when a major media outlet's systems
are hacked and used to attack unsuspecting readers. Let's hope
Network World's systems never suffer such a fate.


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* More mutt updates available from Linux vendors

A buffer overflow in mutt's e-mail address parser could be
exploited by a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary bytes in
memory. Red Hat users can download new versions of mutt from:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-003.html

Linux-Mandrake users can get more from:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-002.php

* Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router vulnerability

According to an alert from Cisco, three vulnerabilities have
been discovered in Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router software
releases up to and including 1.1(5). Two of the vulnerabilities
can cause a denial-of-service attack. The other allows access
to the SN 5420 configuration if it has been previously saved on
the router. There is no workaround for these vulnerabilities.
For more, go to:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/SN-multiple-pub.shtml


* SGI reports NQE vulnerability

The Network Queuing Environment (NQE) that shipped in the past
with SGI contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow
vulnerability that could lead to a malicious user gaining root
access. SGI considers this product retired and will not be
releasing a patch for the problem. For more, go to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20020101-01-I


* Sun releases patch for CDE Subprocess Control Service

A buffer overflow flaw in the CDE Subprocess Control Service
(dtspcd) daemon could be exploited by a malicious user to gain
root access on the affected system. Sun users can download the
appropriate patch from:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/securitypatch


* Debian patches libgtop

Two flaws in the libgtop daemon could allow a malicious user to
gain privileges of the application, usually those for the
""nobody"" user. Debian users can get more information and
patches from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-098


* Microsoft investigating alleged flaw in IE browser

Microsoft said it's investigating an alleged flaw in recent
versions of its Internet Explorer browser software that could
allow attackers to spoof legitimate Web sites, steal content
from browser cookies and gain access to certain types of files
on a victim's system.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108ieflaw.html
Computerworld, 01/08/02


* Linux-Mandrake updates BIND

Previous versions of BIND 9.x that shipped with Linux-Mandrake
8.0 and 8.1 contain insecure permissions, configuration files
and executables. This new release tightens things up a bit. For
more, go to:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-001.php


* Red Hat fixes exim

A flaw in the way exim handles some incoming data could expose
the affected system to arbitrary malicious code. For more, go
to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-176.html


* Patch available for stunnel

Red Hat has released a patch for stunnel to fix a format string
vulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code
on the affected system. For more, go to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-002.html


* Conectiva patches proftpd

Two vulnerabilities in proftpd could allow a malicious user to
bypass some security features or launch a denial-of-service
attack against the affected machine. For more, go to:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000450


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* First virus identified that infects Shockwave Flash files

Antivirus software vendors say they have spotted the first
computer virus that uses Macromedia's Shockwave Flash files to
transmit itself once a victim clicks to run the Flash movie.
Identified as SWF/LFM-926 by antivirus software vendor Sophos,
this virus is not yet ""in the wild,"" infecting computers. The
Shockwave Flash virus was sent to Sophos as a sample via
anonymous e-mail, and this specimen is now being shared and
analyzed among several antivirus vendors.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108flashvirus.html
Network World, 01/08/02

* XM97/Bdoc2-A - An Excel macro virus that displays a message
on April 26 and attempts to shut down the current Windows
session if the day is a multiple of 5. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AX - A Word macro virus that changes user summary
information in the infected document. It also makes changes to
the autoexec.bat file to display a Happy Birthday message on
certain days of the year. (Sophos)

* W32.Donut - A virus only Homer Simpson could love. Symantec
reports this is a concept virus designed to test potential
weaknesses in Microsoft's .Net architecture. (Symantec)

sessions between users. However, these packages do not yet
offer secure communications with users of popular consumer-
oriented IM systems from AOL, Microsoft and others.

* NetScreen offers new VPN-firewall gear

NetScreen this week introduced VPN gear that makes it possible
for users to tailor-fit protection for specific network
resources without having to buy multiple boxes. Four new
NetScreen VPN appliances have at least four 10/100 Ethernet
ports, each of which can oversee a separate, independently
configured security domain.

Today's focus: E-mail intrusion detection

By Jason Meserve


E-mail. It's one of the greatest inventions of our time,
despite the 40 junk mail messages I get each day. Still,
there's one problem: The servers that deliver e-mail also can
become hacker gateways into corporate networks.

Traditional firewalls block a fair amount of malicious traffic,
but they allow e-mail traffic in through Port 25 (SMTP).
Hackers know this and exploit it to gain access to the
corporate goods. Compounding the problem is that many mail
servers run on Windows NT, and as this newsletter has shown,
unless an administrator is ultra-vigilant in applying patches,
NT security can be as solid as Swiss cheese.

IronMail, a new product from Cipher Trust, is designed to help
address this problem. It complements a traditional firewall
while providing intrusion detection specifically for mail
systems. The 1- or 2 rack-unit appliance scans all incoming
mail for viruses, spam and other hacker threats such as buffer
overflow and denial-of-service flood attacks. In the case of
unusually long buffers, IronMail truncates the string before
passing the message off to the mail server, preventing an
overflow and crash on the server.

Also, IronMail can proxy HTTP, IMAP, SMTP and POP, as well as
their secure equivalents. Administrators can set up mail
policies on the server, such as adding a ""This e-mail is
company confidential"" footer to all outgoing messages or
requiring encryption for messages sent to certain domains.

IronMail operates on a Pentium-based appliance running an
optimized version of the FreeBSD operating system. The 1U unit
sells for $17,500 and the 2U unit for $27,500. Spam and
antivirus filtering is sold separately on a per-user basis.

For more, go to:
http://www.ciphertrust.com/ironmail/index.htm

Today's bug patches and security alert:

* More wu-ftpd patches available

As we mentioned in our last newsletter, Core Security
Technologies has discovered a problem in the wu-ftpd server
used by many Linux and Unix vendors. The vulnerability could be
exploited by a remote user to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges. For more, go to:

Debian:
http://www.debian.org/security/
(The alert/patches should be posted shortly.)

Linux-Mandrake:
http://nww1.com/go/linuxm.html

Caldera Open UNIX and UnixWare 7:
http://nww1.com/go/caldera.html

Conectiva (this is an additional update):
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000443

Immunix (another updated release):
http://download.immunix.org/ImmunixOS/7.0/updates/IMNX-2001-70-036-02

CERT advisory:
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-33.html

* Linux-Mandrake patches postfix

A patch is now available for another vulnerability we reported
last week: Postfix, a simple mail transfer agent, contains a
flaw in the way it handles its log files. This could be
exploited to cause a denial-of-service attack against the
affected system. Linux-Mandrake users can download the
appropriate patch from:

http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security/2001/MDKSA-2001-089.php3

* Red Hat updates gdb

Red Hat has released an updated version of the gdb package to
fix a number of bugs reported in previous releases. The new
version can be downloaded from:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHBA-2001-159.html

* New OpenSSH packages from Red Hat

Red Hat has released updated OpenSSH packages. According to the
company, these updates fix a bug in the packages' handling of
restricted keys that could have allowed users to bypass command
restrictions by using subsystems. They also fix a subtle bug
that might have aided a passive analysis attack.
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-154.html

* Cyrus SASL patch available

The Cyrus SASL library is used by sendmail and contains a
potential remote vulnerability that could be exploited by a
malicious user to gain root access. Red Hat has patched the
problem:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-150.html

* SGI patches CDE flaws

We reported a while back that there were a number of root flaws
in the CDE packages for Unix and Linux. The flaw could be
exploited to run arbitrary code on the affected system. SGI has
patched this vulnerability in its IRIX operating system. For
more, go to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20011107-01-P

* SGI will NOT patch Gauntlet firewall

Although flaws have been discovered in the Gauntlet Firewall
for IRIX, the company will not be patching the product since it
is longer supported. For more, go to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20011104-01-I

* Patch available for IRIX NEdit

According to an alert from SGI, there is a vulnerability
related to the way the NEdit editor creates temporary files. A
problem with the software could make it possible to overwrite
any file owned by a user of the editor. For available fixes, go
to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20011105-01-P

* Caldera patches OpenServer setcontext and sysi86
vulnerabilities

A ""family"" of security holes has been discovered in Caldera's
OpenServer. The patch for the flaws could break the
functionality of some authorized programs. For more, go to:
ftp://stage.caldera.com/pub/security/openserver/CSSA-2001-
SCO.35/

Today's roundup of virus alerts:

* WM97/Marker-JZ - A Word macro virus that attempts to FTP
document information to the Codebreaker's Web site. (Sophos)

>From the interesting reading department:

* Intrusion alert

There's a persistent problem with today's new breed of gigabit-
speed intrusion-detection systems: They simply cannot plow
through IP traffic fast enough to provide blanket protection on
networks running at gigabit speed, according to industry
experts and at least three vendors who make such products.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/1203ids.html
Network World, 12/03/01

* Check Point adds clustering support

Check Point Software this week will begin delivering failover
and load sharing capabilities in its VPN-1/Firewall-1 software
in an attempt to make customers' most important sites less
susceptible to crashes.
http://www.nwfusion.com/archive/2001/128038_12-03-2001.html
Network World, 12/03/01

* Linux FTP security vulnerability fixed

A Linux security vulnerability related to FTP, first spotted in
April, is finally getting the attention it deserves as Linux
vendors and the Washington University WU-FTPD Development Group
issued software patches to fix it.

Sally,

We were approached a few months ago regarding this benchmarking study.
You and I decided jointly against Enron's involvement
in this project. 

They have approached us again. Any thoughts?

Vince,
 
We met several months ago with Peter Nance of Teknecon Energy  Risk Advisors (TERA) to discuss Enron's possible participation in our  benchmarking study.
 
Our original schedule has slipped, and I was wondering if you  might reconsider participating.  Here is a presentation that Peter did for  us in Washington DC where 50 companies came to learn more about the study.   Also attached is a sample list of metrics.
 
The kick-off meeting will be in the second week of October in  Houston.  Please let me know if Enron would be interested in joining the  study team.  We have several companies in the top 20 signed up.  I  would be happy to review the list with you over the phone.

>ABSTRACT:
> Based on the peculiarities of electricity as underlying
> commodity of forward contracts we develop a time-continuous
> pricing model for short-term electricity forwards. The suggested
> stochastic volatility model utilizes the non-tradeable spot
> price of electricity and its variance rate as state variables.
> This enables us to capture the non-linearities, and the high and
> time varying volatility seen in electricity prices. Using
> maximum likelihood estimation based on Kalman filtering we
> report empirical results on electricity data from the

>ABSTRACT:
> This paper examines the relationship of futures floor trader
> proprietary positions to their market making activities. In
> particular, we examine interdealer trading, its function as an
> inventory management tool, and its costs. In addition, we
> develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy, where some floor
> traders, who are more successful, profit from their trades with
> other dealers. On average, we find that dealers earn relative
> profits when they execute position reducing trades. However, a
> surprising finding is that more successful traders are more
> likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades,
> which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer
> hierarchy. The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster
> and Mann's 1996 article on futures floor trader inventory
> control, and Reiss and Werner's 1998 article on interdealer
> trading. The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits
> from the elaborate futures data, and the highly competitive
> nature of dealer trading on the floor.

>ABSTRACT:
> The paper assumes that the implied volatility of options with
> some given expiration is a quadratic function of the moneyness.
> The coefficients of this quadratic function (the smile) are time
> dependent and stochastic. The paper derives exposure parameters
> of the price of the option to the local change in each of the
> smile coefficients, and an approximate formula for their risk
> adjusted expected value. These are important in managing the
> exposure of the price of an option portfolio to changes in the
> smile coefficients.

>ABSTRACT:
> We investigate whether the volatility risk premium is negative
> by examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option
> portfolios (buy the option and hedge with stock). Within a
> stochastic volatility framework, we demonstrate a correspondence
> between the sign and magnitude of the volatility risk premium
> and the mean delta-hedged portfolio returns. Using a sample of
> S&P 500 index options, we provide empirical tests that have the
> following general results. First, the delta-hedged strategy
> underperforms zero. Second, the documented underperformance is
> less for options away from the money. Third, the
> underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility.
> Fourth, the volatility risk premium significantly affects
> delta-hedged gains even after accounting for jump-fears. Our
> evidence is supportive of a negative market volatility risk
> premium.

>ABSTRACT:
> In this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer
> investors a superior risk-return trade-off. We do so using a
> continuous time version of Dybvig's (1988a, 1988b) payoff
> distribution pricing model. The evaluation model, which does not
> require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution
> of the funds in question, is applied to the monthly returns of
> 77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices over the period May
> 1990-April 2000. The results show that as a stand-alone
> investment hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return
> profile. We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be
> inefficient, with the average efficiency loss amounting to 2.76%
> per annum for indices and 6.42% for individual funds. Part of
> the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified
> away. Funds of funds, however, are not the preferred vehicle for
> this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their
> double fee structure. Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio
> context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation
> outcomes. Seven of the 12 hedge fund indices and 58 of the 72
> individual funds classified as inefficient on a stand-alone
> basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when
> mixed with the S&P 500. The best results are obtained when
> 10-20% of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds

Subject:	Slides for SIAM Workshop


Dear Dr. Kaminsky,
 
I was in SIAM Workshop last Friday and I enjoyed  your talk very much.  I wonder whether you will be able to email the  material you have presented and also give me some references to start  with.
My Background is B.S. M.A. in Math, Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics,  2 yrs Post Doc doing Computational fluid dynamics in parallel machines (IBM  SP).  For the past 4 yrs I am doing the Basin Simulation development with  Mobil.  I always wonder how  the financial problems can be solved and  how the numerical computing, especially, supercomputers, can be applied to these  problems. Your talk is a very good starting place for me.
 
Thank you very much.
 
Best Regards,
 
Terrence Liao

"The Prediction meeting notes","Steve,

Two things. 

1. Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503?
I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but
want to make sure I did not miss any important point.

2. Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship,
how would you like to be involved? Out of London or, possibly,
Houston? Please, let me know.

Vince

Hi, Dr. Kaminski:

   I am Zhendong, the student of Dr. Deng. I think Dr. Deng has sent my
resume to you. I am very happy to have an opportunity to work with you
this summer.
   I am a student in both MS qcf and Ph.d EDA programs in Georgia Tech
now. I plan to find a job in industry instead of academic after my
graduation. So I intend to do internship during the process of prusuing my
degree to acquire some experience for my future career.
   I hope to start on 5/14/2001 and end on 8/17/2001.
   Thanks a lot.

  Dear Sandeep,

  You can download the materials of our early studies from

  http://homepage2.nifty.com/mcbm/

  We have made many documents about our model. Unfortunately,
  they have been written in Japanese. If you can understand
  Japanese, I can send some of them quickly.

  It takes several weeks to send ""Application that you have
  developed (e.g. for Daiwa)"". There are some NDAs with Daiwa.
  We, therefore, must check whether the documents satisfy with
  the NDA, or not.

  In the current stage, I hope only open information.

  Best regards,
  Yuji Uenohara

Subject:	RE: Raptor Discount Valuations

Ron:

I added to your spreadsheet the valuation of the combined Peregrine and Shortfall restrictions using an approach that Vassant and I discussed yesterday. 
It assumes: 
	1) Below $50.00 Shortfall will have restrictions on the whole number of shares (18MM shares); 
	2) Above $76.00 Peregrine will be fully rstricted.
	3) Between $50.00 and $76.00 Peregrine will bear a restriction proportional to (S-50)/(76-50) on 18MM shares and 
	   the Shorfall takes the restriction on the remaining shares.
Let's fix some time today to discuss the approach and results.

 

Thanks
Paulo Issler

Paulo,
Attached is the option valuation model that I put together.  Also, the high end number for the Peregrine/Shortfall forwards range is actually $75.89, rather than the $76 which I gave you.  Thanks again for the assistance.

Subject:  KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Rick/Vince,

Should this not be a Credit/Research initiative while the business unit focuses on originating good economic transactions?  Not to be complaining, but shouldn't EES be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than waste resources on a project we are already moving forward on?  You can't run a portfolio model, unless you have deals in a risk system!  How complex do we want these MODELS to be?  Behavioral implications on credit default?  They still don't seem to understand.

Regards,
Bill


Mark - please attend.  You may want to include Martin to help EES understand the complexity of their deals.

Subject:	Credit Risk Model Comments - at this point.

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so exclusive, this will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract. However, the JC Penny's version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get back. 

1)	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done already.

2)	The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input credit rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3)	Are all ""defaults"" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we are dealing with specific types of firms where ""default"" may not mean we do not get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it's not like Montgomery Ward's where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so fundamental for a company's success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4)	A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that don't. By that I mean that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn't. This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn't consider. This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5)	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If we can combine our customers into ""exposure group portfolios"" (for lack of a better term), where a group has similar ""risk characteristics"" beyind the current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6)	A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments. Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random number generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enron's aggregate credit risk?

7)	There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the ""improved"" analysis could make the credit risk be higher. 

Rick

Buried Cities
-------------

Recently I saw a TV show in which archaeologists were uncovering a
buried city. What's up with that? I mean, even if you were the
dumbest of all ancient peoples, wouldn't you notice that your city
was slowly getting covered up with dirt and maybe crank up your
housekeeping efforts a notch? And don't tell me that brooms hadn't
been invented yet. They had plenty of sticks and plenty of
chickens, so you'd think that by pure coincidence one day a chicken
would back into a stick and invent the broom.

Maybe when the dirt builds up gradually you don't notice a problem
until your house disappears. I can imagine the conversation on the
day they figured out what was happening:

Ixphalup:  Hey, Fnorkzak, be a dear and go downstairs and get
           my stone bowl, the crude one.

Fnorkzak:  Downstairs is gone. It's all dirt.

Ixphalup:  Uh oh, fetch Grandpa; it's time to abandon the
           city.

Fnorkzak:  He's downstairs, most of him anyway, except for
           the top of his head.

Ixphalup:  Hmm... It sounds like I found a new bowl.


I like to mock the ancients, but I'm a bad housekeeper myself,
albeit not on the ""lost city"" scale. Sometimes I'll lose a pencil
-- at most a sneaker -- to the growing sediment layer before I'm
forced by the homeowners' association to sell the house. But I'm
too fastidious to lose anything big like a car or sofa.

Fun fact: Until Mayor Giuliani cleaned up New York City, the
highest building was two stories tall and no one could remember
when anything had been taller.

Disturbing Trend
-----------------

Stay with me on this line of reasoning: Vice President Dick Cheney
recently got a defibrillator to keep his heart beating. He also has
corrective lenses to enhance his vision. He has fillings in his
teeth so he can eat and he has a cell phone in his pocket.
Individually these items mean nothing but collectively they raise
an important question:

     How much hardware can you have attached to your
     body before you're technically a cyborg?

I'm worried that Cheney is already a cyborg. Without the hardware,
he'd be a blind, starving, bald guy with no pulse. That's a pretty
good argument for defining him as part man, part machine. The
disturbing thing is this: To whom does he pledge his allegiance --
machines or people?

If I'm right, within two years Cheney will be living inside a
hardened mountain in Wyoming, hardwired into the national missile
defense grid. And we'll all become slaves to our machine overlords.
Highways will be filled with humans carrying SUVs on their backs.
Television sets will make you dance for their amusement. It won't
be pretty.

Before you rush to label me paranoid, consider who elected Cheney
in the first place. Sure, we humans pulled the levers and poked the
chads, but in the end the machines did the counting and elected one
of their own.

And you'll notice that Cheney supports any policy that results in
more hardware, like the Star Wars missile defense shield and more
oil drilling. I think this is how machines reproduce. First they
conquer the humanoid government and then they create tax incentives
to produce more machines. The ants are milking the aphids and we're
the aphids.

I don't know what George W. Bush's role is in all this, but if you
look at his recent photos you'll see that he always has a little
oil can with him.

The irony is that Al Gore lost the election largely because he
looked like a robot. In fact, he was only an advanced android from
a distant nebula sent here as a prank.

Anyway, I'm worried that somehow Cheney will get control of the
Internet and ...

Boss and Cow-orker Quotes
-------------------------

Here now, more true-life quotes from bosses and cow-orkers,
submitted by DNRC members.

----

During one meeting with clients my boss told them to, ""Cut the cake
a different way and go for the lowest hanging fruit.""  I told him
he should tell them to go for the lowest hanging plums.....

----

We used to have a vice president who had a way with words.  He told
us during a meeting that we couldn't start a new program because,
""We'd be biting off a new can of worms.""

When he was hiring a new secretary he said that he ""had been
interviewing some good suspects.""

My assistant told me, ""Don't kiss a gift horse in the mouth.""

---

Combining two quotes to stress the fact that he had a backup plan,
my boss said, ""I've got a card in my hole.""

---

I was driving to the Omaha, Nebraska, airport with my boss and our
conversation led to airport food.  He said the last time he ate the
food at the Omaha airport it gave him gonorrhea.  (We think he
meant diarrhea.)

---

""Well, it's no skin off MY teeth!""

A friend's mother frequently uses the phrase, ""sweating like a
stuck pig.""

----

All from one boss...

""That's just cutting your throat to spite your face.""

""We have to be careful not to put all our apples in one cart.""

""This project is like pulling hen's teeth.""

""I'm being raped over the coals.""

----

In a misguided attempt to motivate me, my pointy-haired boss once
said, ""Remember!  There is no 'I' in 'Team Spirit'!""

I tried to explain that there are two of them in there but it
seemed to confuse him.

----

A true quote from my sister's pointy-haired boss:

""I don't want to throw another monkey at the wrench right now.""

----

My boss was pleased that with one phone call we had ""killed two
stones.""

A good PHB misquote:

""...if we pass mustard...""

----

At one meeting my boss said, ""That'll put the can amongst the
worms.""

---

I have a friend whose supervisor proudly proclaimed that her new
car was a ""Honda Accordion Hunchback.""  By the way, she was the
supervisor of the Customer Service department.



Lazy Entrepreneur
-----------------
http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/lazyentrepreneur/

The Lazy Entrepreneur feature on Dilbert.com has over 4,000
brilliant ideas submitted by DNRC members. I just submitted a new
one that I call BIG DOG SHIELD. It's a Plexiglas(tm) shield you can
use when visiting the home of someone who has a huge exuberant
slobbering dog who insists on jumping and drooling all over your
good clothes. You'd only need the shield for the first five minutes
of the visit, until the dog calms down. Florist shops could rent
the BIG DOG SHIELD to young men on prom night when they pick up
their corsages. When the young man arrives at his date's house, and
her big slobbering dog lunges toward his rented tuxedo with forty
toenails and nine pounds of wet tongue, the young man can toss the
corsage in the foyer and hide behind the BIG DOG SHIELD until his
date is ready to go. It's not the most macho way to start a date,
but it's better than wearing slobber to the prom.


True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Induhviduals continue to amaze and amuse. Here are more True Tales,
submitted by DNRC members.

---

Actual conversation I overheard in school:

Induhvidual 1:  ""If the Eiffel tower is a bridge, how come
                you can't drive on it?""

Induhvidual 2:  ""The Eiffel tower isn't a bridge.""

Induhvidual 1:  ""Yes it is. You can walk across it, and it
                has two tall block things.""

Induhvidual 2:  ""The last time I was in New York it wasn't a
                bridge.""


----

Here's a true Induhvidual story that I found in the Swedish
newspaper ""Sydsvenska Dagbladet.""

Four people were chosen randomly and asked if they were concerned
that they might buy products produced by children. Three of the
four people said they think child labor is horrible and that they
would never buy products made by children. The fourth person missed
the point entirely and said that she wouldn't buy these products
since children ""have no feeling for quality, which will result in
poorer quality of the final product.""

----

A few years ago, as a solar eclipse approached, some planetarium
directors in Southern California sent out warnings to the community
about the eclipse. Experience shows that daytime darkness leads to
accidents among Induhviduals, and also they have been known to
stare at the partially eclipsed sun and blind themselves.  (Honest.
It really happens.)  The planetarium received an indignant letter
from a local Induhvidual.  She said that if an eclipse was so
dangerous, they never should have decided to hold one and ought to
cancel it.

-----

My dad always locked his keys in the car by accident.  He had been
doing this for about a year, when one day, he approached my mom and
said, ""You know what?  I'm going to leave the coat hanger in the
trunk so I can unlock the car the next time this happens.""

-----

Our company accountant came and asked for a new power strip and I
gave him one. Then he asked if I could come and install it for him.
I told him it was pretty simple - shutdown computer, unplug
everything, remove existing strip, plug in new strip, plug in
computer, turn it on. He said, ""Really?""

Recognizing the opportunity I said, ""Well, you also have to Telnet
into the device, and make sure it's set for English voltage and not
metric or else you'll burn up the motherboard."" He looked confused
and said, ""I'll wait until you have time to install it.""

---

I saw a lady on TV who liked to collect Nativity scenes. She
proudly showed off one of her favorite sets, where the figures,
according to her description, were ""African-American.""

-----

We had a CONsultant come in to our company who helped us determine
our personality types so that we could learn to work together
better.  She uses the Jung-Myers-Briggs Typology and one of the
continuums it ranks you on is Judging versus Perceiving (J vs P).
She paired up people who fell into the P category with people who
were in the J category for an exercise in which they were supposed
to try to think like the other.  The president of our company said
he didn't understand the purpose so she tried to explain it to him.

""You have a lot of J-ness, but not enough P-ness.""

Needless to say the exercise was never completed.

---

Recently the teachers' contract in my school district ran out and
the teachers demanded a 4% raise.  Two weeks before the strike date
the school board passed out an exam to all students; the average
grade was 49%. The school board told the teachers that this was
unacceptable and there would be no raises. But they offered that
the teachers could get 1% pay increases for every 3% the average
test score increased on the next test. The union came back with one
demand, that the teachers create the tests. The next test average
was 76%, which the school board credited to ""our ability to
motivate our teachers."" And how.

-----

A couple of years ago at college, I went to the library to get a
signed statement that I did not have any unpaid library fines. This
was required to get my exam results. The woman at the counter wrote
down my name and student ID followed by, ""does not have any fines
at the libara."" She crossed off the last word and tried again with
""liberery"", then crossed that out and wrote ""here.""

I wonder what she uses as her job title?

----

One day in the cafeteria at my school a girl was asking for
donations for a foundation named after a boy who had a terminal
illness.  Unfortunately the boy had recently died, so she was
asking us to ""donate money for this dead kid.""  My Induhvidual
buddy actually asked her how money could help a dead kid.  When she
said -- get this-- ""It might help with the autopsy,"" he responded,
""Oh, so they might still be able to cure him?""

----

My friend's seven-month pregnant wife was returning to her car with
her three-year-old daughter after shopping in the mall.  The
daughter wanted to play driver so Linda (not her real name) allowed
her daughter to sit in the driver's seat.  The daughter insisted
that Linda sit in the backseat of her four-door Honda.  After a
couple of minutes of playtime Linda decided it was time to go home.
She tried to get out of the car but the childproof locks wouldn't
let her open the back doors of the car. So Linda crawled between
the two front seats, then crawled headfirst out to the parking.
Upon returning home she told her tale of woe to her husband who --
being the sensitive guy he is -- said, ""Why didn't you roll down
the window and open the door from the outside?""

----

When I worked at Barnes & Noble years ago I had a customer ask
where we kept the ""large-print audio books.""

----

My teenage daughter sometimes forgets her house key and is locked
out after school. Her first choice of entry is to ask our neighbor
to get out his ladder and climb in a window on the second floor and
unlock a door. She's done this several times. We get to tease her a
lot about being an airhead.

So one day I locked myself out on the way to do errands. I was in
the car before I even realized I had left my keys inside. So,
thinking of my daughter's solution, I asked my laughing neighbor
for help. Being a nice guy, he obliged with his ladder, climbing to
the second story, etc.

Later that day, I was relating the story to my husband. When I got
to the part about sitting in the car without the keys he said, ""And
then you took the garage door opener out of the glove compartment
and let yourself in?""

-----

My local supermarket recently had a campaign to raise money for the
Jimmy Fund, a New England charity for children with cancer. At the
checkout, clerks asked customers if they wished to donate a dollar
to the Jimmy Fund.

As I left the store, I noticed the hand-lettered sign by the door:
""Fight Children With Cancer.""

Geez, I thought, don't those poor kids have it hard enough already?

----

My first year of graduate school, I moved into an apartment that
didn't have a smoke detector. After doing some checking into state
landlord-tenant law, I confirmed my suspicion that the landlady was
required to provide us with a smoke detector, so I took the issue
up with the landlady.  My Induhvidual of a roommate was upset with
me for this, fearing that by ""rocking the boat"" I was going to get
us kicked out of the apartment. She summed up her arguments to me
by saying, ""Besides which, I don't see why we even need a smoke
detector.  Back home in Kentucky, we never had a smoke detector at
our house and we never once had a fire.""

----

My company experienced a power outage (California).  When all was
dark, several employees grabbed the flashlights that are stored in
boxes in the hallway for just such an occasion.  One employee's
flashlight was very dim, suggesting that the battery was not fully
charged.  I noticed that he was repeatedly holding his hand over
the front of the flashlight, then pulling it away.  When I asked
him what he was doing he explained that he was ""trying to build up
a lot of light.""

-----

At Badwater, Death Valley, there's a sign on a rock to indicate sea
level. I overheard a couple of Induhviduals who were looking at
the sign and talking.

The woman says, ""I wonder if it's the top or bottom.""

""Of the sign?"" her husband asks.

""No, of the sea,"" she replied.

-----

Being the ""scientific"" one around the office, an Induhvidual asked
me if I knew about telescopes.  I said yes and she explained that
she bought her son a telescope but she couldn't seem to get it to
focus on any stars.  I told her to point it at houses down the
street with lights and see if she could see anything.  She said,
""You can use a telescope to look at things on the ground?""  As it
turns out, focusing wasn't the problem.  It had been an overcast
evening and she thought the telescope was strong enough to get
through the clouds to see stars.


---

I saw this sign on a Chinese restaurant:

KING CRAP
2 for $35

I think they meant King Crab but I can't be sure.

----

A Burger King restaurant in Rome, NY, was advertising for
""Closers""... but the ""C"" was removed or blown away from their
marquee so it read ""Losers Wanted.""

----

I heard this from an Induhvidual standing near the Continental
Divide at Yellowstone Park:

""On which side of the Continental Divide does the water flow
uphill?""

----

There is a locked suggestion box in the cafeteria of my company. I
just found out from HR that no one has a key for it.

---

My wife manages a convenience store.  Yesterday a mother and
daughter (maybe two years old) came into the store.  When the
mother was ready to go to the register, she called to her daughter,
""Ampersand! Ampersand!  Let's go honey.""

My wife couldn't believe what she heard, so she asked the customer,
""What's your daughter's name?"" and the Induhvidual replied,
""Ampersand.  I don't know what it means, but I think it's a lovely
girl's name.""

-----

With the recent and spectacular downturn of the stock market there
has been a lot of concern in the mutual fund industry as ""assets
under management"" shrink.  While we haven't experienced layoffs,
the environment has been eroded to the point where many people have
left the company of their own accord.  In an effort to bolster

eBook Update
------------

My non-Dilbert e-book, ""God's Debris"", continues to be the
bestselling e-book in the entire world, and -- depending on whether
there is advanced life on other planets -- it might be the
bestselling e-book in the entire universe. For you Earthlings it is
available at:

Dilbert Wallpaper
---------------------
You can now download wallpaper featuring various Dilbert characters
at:

The Dogbert wallpaper is especially helpful if there's any
stupidity where you work.


Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to
answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have
been changed to make them funnier.

---

Dear Mr. Adams,

When my local newspaper moved Dilbert to the business section it
became three frames instead of four. Was that your decision or the
paper's?

      Ana


Dear Anal,

Mr. Adams creates over 100 frames for every daily strip, thanks to
the help of highly trained capuchin monkeys. The newspapers receive
the whole pile and throw away whatever frames they don't like. Some
keep one or two frames, and a few who have no taste keep as many as
three or four. Mr. Adams used to feel bad about his ratio until he
learned that the creator of The Family Circus actually draws a full
length animated motion picture every day -- using absolutely no
monkeys -- and the newspapers only use one frame. That's gotta be
frustrating.


     Sincerely,


     Dogbert



Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Wiley & sons publishing asked me if there were  people that I knew that were famous and intelligent to send the preprinting book  to for the purpose of getting an endorsing comment to put on the cover. Would  you be interested in doing so?
 
Secondly, it has been suggested to me to do some  teaching of investments at the University of Houston. Do you know any names from  over there and does Pravine Kumar ring a bell?

Greetings. 

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us 
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at 
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was. 

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of 
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the 
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your 
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a 
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other 
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public 
Affairs Mike Rosen. 

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I 
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26, 
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule 
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would 
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or 
whether you would prefer a subset thereof. 

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is 
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy 
Finance Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (Tel.: 
512-232-7386) to coordinate matters.

I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation,

Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

I just wanted to let you know that I am going to start working on a couple of projects for your group as a result of yesterday's meeting.

1)	Establish a Toastmasters ""club"" at Enron in order to give the members of your team, as well as other employees, the opportunity to be proactive in developing their leadership and presentation skills.
?	Yesterday I learned that we do have Toastmasters here at Enron that meets on Thursday at lunch.  I am scheduling a meeting with the lead and will report back to you as to whether another club that would meet at a different day/ time (perhaps in the evening) would be successful, and how we can more effectively market this program. 

2)	Continue to work with our organizational development and training team to develop a specialized program that will address the following needs:  ESL, effective communication, presentation skills, and selling/ networking skills.  Currently we are sponsoring an ESL class a group in Networks group, but I would like to try and take that concept further so that your specific needs can be adequately addressed.  

If you think that there are any other areas that I can focus on, please do not hesitate to let me know.  

Thanks,
Anne

Amitava,

Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its scope.  I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust model off more comprehensive data to start with.

Cheers,

Subject:	Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical snapshot+performance data for model development

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots											Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end			12 month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end				12 month end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end					12 month end performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end				12 month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Regards,
Amitava

May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our HR department.

I don't see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short

When you come here you can determine in what area he could make
the biggest contribution to Enron. I shall call or E-mail
him independently and talk to him.

Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek

Power Curve 6: Crossing the Mountaintop; Lower Outlook, Ratings


   SUMMARY VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION DATA
* We reduce earnings estimates, ratings and price
  targets for a number of our companies who are ""long""
  power.  In all, we are lowering ratings on seven
  companies, price targets on thirteen, and earnings
  estimates on sixteen.
* This follows our call (Power Curve 4, published
  May 2) where we established a more cautious outlook
  for Power Producers versus Energy Merchants.
* Since our last Power Curve analysis on May 31, we
  have seen the continued deterioration of both
  forward power prices and spark spreads.
* June was the first period in which we have seen
  year/year declines in power prices and spark
  spreads.  We had expected to see these signs first
  in 1Q:02.
* We maintain a bullish outlook on those companies
  that are not leveraged to power prices, whether
  through strong risk management skills or through a
  lack of generation.  Our top two picks are ENE and
  DYN.

POWER PRICES HAVE PEAKED; WE ARE CROSSING THE MOUNTAINTOP AND NOW EXPECT A
DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT

June is the first month that we have seen negative year-on-year comparisons in
the commodity drivers that underlie earnings.  Based on work in our last Power
Curve report (Power Curve 5, 5/31/01), we had not expected the commodity
drivers of earnings to turn negative until 1Q:02.  Instead, we see commodity
comparisons turning negative in June, and on a full quarterly basis, 3Q:01.

                                       June 2001  June 2000     % Change
Power Prices ($/MWh)                     $50.21      $83.25       (40%)
Spark Spread ($/MWh)                     $23.77      $56.93       (58%)

In our view, the most important measure for earnings, particularly for Power
Producers, is the Spark Spread, which shows the gross margin potential for
power generation in the spot market.  Hedging, trading, and the sale of other
services such as capacity availability and spinning reserves offsets the impact
of a decline in this number.  Most companies with generating capacity are at
least 85% hedged for 2001, 60% hedged for 2002, and 40% hedged for 2003.

NEGATIVE QUARTERLY COMMODITY DRIVERS BEGINNING 3Q:01, TWO QUARTERS AHEAD OF
EARLIER EXPECTATIONS

Forward power and gas markets suggest that 3Q:01 will be the first full quarter
of negative commodity comparisons.  Earlier, in PC5, we had expected this would
not occur until 1Q:02.  What has surprised us is the swiftness and breadth of
the decline in the power pricing environment.  Unlike 2Q:01, which had two good
months -- April and May -- to buoy earnings, forward markets suggest year/year
declines in power prices and the spark spread for all of 3Q:01 and continuing
into 4Q:01.  June is an important ""swing"" month in what is normally a
relatively volatile earnings quarter.  So far, because of lower realized prices
and a declining power price outlook, a number of companies have either pre-
announced or guided to reduced earnings expectations, including:  PPL, PNW,
PNM, NRG, KSE and CEG.

Quarterly Comparisons, Power Prices and Spark Spreads

DOWNGRADING STOCKS; DECLINING POWER PRICES ARE NOT GOOD FOR EARNINGS

In a declining power pricing environment, investors should take a more cautious
stance on companies who are ""long"" the commodity -- i.e., companies who,
because of their business model, are making a long bet on commodity prices.
Within this constraint, we look for signs that mitigate this exposure.
Furthermore, we are positive on the long-run case for aggressive companies who
are building newer, more efficient power plants and replacing the aging plant
that has built up under 70 years of regulation.  As long-run bets, companies
such as Calpine (CPN, downgraded to 2H from 1H) offer an excellent play on
deregulation, although we temper our outlook due to declining power prices.
Certain other Power Producers are better positioned than others, and when we
add the valuation component to this discussion (the stock prices of many
Producers peaked in late April/early May), we think a number still offer
attractive value.

However, our broad thrust is to recommend companies who are not long power (or
have small exposure), whether because of strong trading and risk management
skills or a lack of generating capacity.  In Power Curve 4 (5/1/01), when we
first wrote about the declining price curve, we suggested a more cautious
stance towards Power Producers versus Energy Merchants.  We stand by that
advice.  We are downgrading the rating on only 1 Merchant vs. 4 Producers and
Integrated Utilities who are exposed to power prices.  In terms of estimates,
only 2 Merchants are being reduced, while we are reducing 14 Power Producers
and Integrated Utilities.  Our top 3 growth-oriented picks for investors who
want to avoid the impact of declining power prices are Energy Merchants ENE,
DYN and ILA.  For dividend or total-return investors, we recommend Integrated
Utilities EXC, ETR, and AEP.

MACRO VIEW:  WHY ARE POWER PRICES DECLINING?

Figure 1.  The Forward Power Curve ($/MWh) --U.S.

            1998      1999      2000      2001F     2002F     2003F
  $/MWh    $36.22    $40.53    $67.61    $73.44    $41.72    $36.81

The forward curve for power shows a rapid decline from peak levels achieved in
2000 and 2001E.  Rapid growth in construction of new generating capacity is the
primary cause of the decline in forward price expectations (with the slowing
economy an additional factor in the near-term).  See Figure 2.  Additionally,
we cite two reasons why plant builds tend to over-shoot (either on the upside
or the downside) changes in the demand for power.  These are because
electricity is capital intensive and a commodity, each of which creates cycles
of over- and under-development.

(1) Incremental Capacity Exceeds Incremental Demand.  The cause of
the current decline in prices is the rapid addition of new generating capacity,
in all regions of the country.  Additions to capacity are exceeding increases
in demand for power, by a wide margin, in most regions.  This has caused the
supply and demand balance to shift from a shortage to a growing surplus.
Additional factors have hastened the decline in prices.  A slowing economy has
reduced demand, as has the absence of last year's hotter-than-normal weather.
So far this summer, weather has been approximately normal.

(2) Capacity additions exceeded incremental demand in 2000.  We
think 2000 was the first year when incremental capacity exceeded incremental
demand.  We still have an underlying power shortage, which has lasted well into
2001.  However, the market is adding capacity in a manner which should
relentlessly lessen its severity and even potentially create over-capacity
within the next several years. In 2000, 27,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity was
added, up from 11,000 in 1999, and less than 10,000 MW during most of the
1990's.  We expect approximately 45,000 MW of capacity will be added in 2001,
and a similar number in 2002.  Since this amount exceeds the amount required to
meet growth in demand, we project a rising ""reserve margin.""  The reserve
margin is the best fundamental indicator of the balance between supply and
demand, with a high reserve margin indicating over-capacity (falling power
prices), and a low reserve margin indicating under-capacity (rising power
prices).  We tentatively project a bottoming of the electricity commodity price
cycle in 2003, if enough developers scale back their plans to build new plants.

TWO REASONS FOR BOOM AND BUST CYCLES IN POWER

(1) Electricity is a cyclical commodity industry.  We have reached the peak
of the ""first-ever"" cycle in the history of the industry.  We put ""first"" in
quotes because we think the cycles were always there, except they were hidden
by regulation.  With deregulation of the wholesale power market in 1996,
market-clearing prices reveal the balance between supply and demand.  From 1996
until mid 2001, we were climbing the mountaintop of the electricity cycle.  Now
we are on the downside.

(2) Electricity production is capital-intensive.  We think the cycles will last
a number of years, 4-6 years in the current cycle (we put the first year as
1998, when enough liquidity existed in the newly deregulated market; we see the
bottom as 2003), driven by the capital-intensive nature of the industry.  Power
plants take a long time to build.  Planning decisions must be made between 1
and 5 years in advance of the actual day when power will be produced.  This is
a much slower process than the market, and pricing expectations at the time of
planning will have no doubt changed by the time plants are up-and-running.  We
think it is difficult for individual company executives to fully anticipate the
development plans of their competitors and, in the quest for market share, the
tendency is to build in a manner which is often too aggressive when viewed on
an industry-wide basis years later.

GUIDE TO INVESTORS:  INDUSTRY-LEVEL

TRACK THE SPARK SPREAD.   A primary metric for investors to track is the
""spark spread"".  The spark spread measures the difference between power prices
(revenues) and natural gas prices (cost).  This is the critical metric for
tracking earnings power of generating companies.  The gross margin of Power
Producers in the spot market will be determined by the spark spread, and when
these companies hedge, they will have to hedge using the forward spark spread
available at that time.  Thus, a declining spark spread affects the earnings
power of all companies, even those who are well hedged.  Only if they could
hedge 100% would their earnings be unaffected by declining prices.  No company
we are aware of has been able to hedge 100% of their output.

The forward spark spread actually suggests a worse commodity price environment
in the 2002/3 period than existed in 1998/9, prior to the run-up in prices in
2000/1.

STOCKS THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM

The following factors will help companies weather the storm, from most to least
importance:

Trading and risk management skills.  A strong trading desk acts as the ""eyes
and ears"" to the market, often providing advance warning of changes in the
commodity price outlook.  Companies with generating plant portfolios can use a
strong trading desk to lock in power and gas prices earlier than their
competitors.  The pure play Energy Merchants derive the bulk of their profits
from trading and risk management activities, own little if any generating
capacity, and are characterized by a commodity price-neutral earnings model.
All of our Energy Merchants have trading and risk management skills that help
their overall activity.  Our top pick and a pure play Energy Merchant is Enron
(ENE-1H).  We do not see their earnings being affected by a declining price
environment.  Other companies with strong trading/risk management operations
include Dynegy (DYN-1H) and Aquila (ILA-1H).  Duke Energy (DUK-1H) and Mirant
(MIR-1H) also have strong operations.  In terms of vulnerability to power
prices, we think ENE and ILA have the strongest positions, owing to the lack or
near-lack of generating capacity owned.

Contracting/hedging activity.  The more aggressive a company's moves were to
lock in power prices earlier this year, the better positioned they are.
Nevertheless, the unhedged portion of capacity can have a significant affect on
earnings, particularly in the long-run.  We note that Calpine (CPN-2H), which
we have downgraded to 2H from 1H, has aggressively stepped up its hedging
activity in recent weeks, signing a 3,000 MW deal with Shell, a 1,000 MW deal
with Reliant Resources (RRI-NR).  This activity appears to coincide with the
rapid declines in the forward curve we have seen over the past two months.

Offsetting ""short"" positions.  This is a characteristic typical of electric
utilities, who in many cases offset their long positions in generation with the
short obligation to sell power to their customers.  Utilities that are well-
positioned in this regard include:  EXC and AEP.  Utilities that are most
vulnerable are those who have aggressively developed generating capacity in an
effort to capture some of the earnings and growth visibility of the pure play
Power Producers.  These include:  AYE, CEG, and PPL.  We are particularly
concerned about companies that have invested in peaking capacity, or,
separately, relatively inefficient plants that require a lot of capital dollars
to upgrade.  These plants are often the ""marginal"" unit, providing earnings in
tight pricing environments, but having significantly less value as prices
decline.

Backlog of plant development.  We also think that companies with significant
plant development backlogs can ""muscle"" their way through a weakened commodity
price environment.  In particular, we note CPN, whose plants in operation grow
as follows:

Figure 4. Calpine Earnings Metrics, 2000-2003E

                         2000     2001     2002     2003       CAGR
Y/E MW in operation     5,883   11,705   21,266   30,463        73%
% of portfolio hedged             85%      71%      61%
EPS                     $1.11    $1.95    $2.30    $3.00        39%

They have hedged aggressively their output from their plants, so even though
future plants have lower margins, overall EPS growth can still be impressive.
Nevertheless, we have also lowered our EPS estimates for CPN, reflecting the
impact of lower spark spreads on the unhedged portion of output.  Our revised
""Outperform"" rating for CPN reflects the likely strong visibility of EPS growth
over the 2000-2003 period.

SUMMARY OF RATINGS/ESTIMATES/PRICE TARGET CHANGES

REVISED VALUATION TABLE

RISKS TO OUR MORE CAUTIOUS STANCE

We see four principal risks to our more cautious stance.

Some horses are already out of the barn.  Power Producers and selected
Energy Merchants (those with exposure to power prices) are down 26% since
peaking on May 1.  Some of the risk of declining forward power prices is now
reflected in the stocks.  However, we do not think all of the horses are out of
the barn, and advise cautiously shutting the barn door on selected stocks at
this time.  The next leg that could drive stocks downward is declining EPS
estimates.  We think this is likely, particularly for 2002 and 2003, if power
prices continue their decline.  We think when this happens, stocks are likely
to go down further.

Hotter Weather.  So far in 2001, weather across the country has been near-
normal vs. hotter-than-normal weather last year.  The year-on-year moderation
has affected the forward curve.  Should August become hotter relative to last
year, the forward curve could temporarily strengthen, boosting power price and
earnings expectations near-term.  Ultimately, we think the principal cause of
the decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants.  Even if the
curve temporarily strengthens due to weather, we still expect it will be
downward sloping for the next several years.

A Rebound in the Economy.  A weak economy has certainly affected power
demand, which, in turn, has affected the forward curve.  When the economy
eventually rebounds, which some are predicting by 4Q:01 or early 2002, the
forward curve should strengthen.  We will watch for these signs and adjust our
outlook accordingly.

Cancellations of plant development plans.  This factor is a wildcard for the
group in our opinion.  We expect to see a number of weaker developers begin to
cancel plant development plans.  So far, sources such as turbine manufacturer
GE has not given any indication turbine orders are being canceled.  If/when
they occur, the cancellation of development plans will have two effects.
First, it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment, and
would likely be perceived as negative.  Then, following the cancellation of
enough development plans, it will sow the seeds for the recovery of power
prices in the future.  This is why we think power prices will bottom in 2003.
The mechanism for rebuilding the forward curve will, in part, be driven by
cancellation of plant development plans and the restoration of a tighter
supply-demand balance.

SUMMARY:  BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS ON GROUP.

We are lowering ratings, price targets and/or estimates on 11 companies with
exposure to the declining trend in power prices.  We advise investors to be
more cautious on the group.  However, we continue to advise a shift toward
Energy Merchants, who have little or no commodity price exposure, and away from
Power Producers, who are long power, as well as those Integrated Utilities who
are long power.  Additionally, we see several factors that also merit a
cautious outlook, apart from the declining trend in power prices and its
adverse effect on earnings:

(1) Utilities as a defensive play may become less valuable if the broad market
begins to recover and/or tech stocks begin to outperform.

(2) Growth Energy stocks have benefited from strong earnings visibility at a
time when many other S&P 500 sectors have ""rolled over.""  The resumption of
earnings growth in any of these other sectors could draw growth capital away
from our Growth Energy names, particularly if their earnings is now under
challenge.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Subject:	RE: Raptor Update

Vince,

I met with Gordon yesterday and have up-to-date information on the public and private hedges we placed in Raptors 1 and 2.  There has been value loss there.  The following are the current values for R1. I shall cross-check the values again before we model these into our liquidation valuation.
For R2, HC is the only remaining value, it appears.  However, we have already entered into a contract with Bear and Stearns who are shorting HC presently and wll settle with Enron around October, 2001, after Enron makes its sale.  So, it may not be relevant if we want to look at the liquidation value at maturity from a volatility perspective.

Thanks.

Makes sense. Let's meet with Gordon. I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting. 

Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?

I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's
liquidity at some point.

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.

We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 

Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for
a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer,
Mark Taylor, as well.

Milly:  I have been asked to contact you to determine the status of the Permanent Residency application for Mr. Krishnarao.

On checking an old file for Mr. Krishnarao, I see that you started his Green Card application, based on Outstanding Researcher, in November, 1995.  There are also copies of the I-765 in the file, which I assume means that Mr. Krishnarao is already in the Adjustment of Status stage of the process?

I would appreciate you letting myself and Michelle Cash know where we are with the application at this time?  Hopefully, we are very close to completion! 

Many thanks

Hello Vince,

It was good to talk with you yesterday. David Rowe and I will be happy to
meet with you for breakfast at 7:00 on Tuesday. I will call on Monday to
set the location.

The URL for our commodity option calculator demonstration is

	http://perun.otci.net/Utility

Note that several of the data sets, which we obtain daily from NYMEX, are
incomplete. NG, HO, CN, NT and CL have enough data to indicate performance.
The others are either missing altogether or the series is too short to be
useful.

If you want to see the currency demonstration, it is at

	http://perun.otci.net/BC

and includes some technical material describing work we did in creating the
site.

With best regards,

Hello Vince:

  We had spoken over the phone in late May, and setup an appointment to see
each other on 24 July 2001.  A few days later Yannis Tzamouranis called me
from Dynegy, and Dynegy moved very quickly to hire me.  I have a wife and a
kid, and I was a $25K/annum post-doc.  I simply couldn't wait.  From lunch
on 25 May, I was essentially hired by Yannis on 3 July.
  Yesterday I attended an INFORMS meeting with a presentor from Enron:
Chonawee Supatgiat, Research Group, Enron Corp.  I enjoyed his talk.  I am
enjoying Dynegy, but I'm learning that the possibilities of doing research
will be limited for a while to come, the weather group being so new to
Dynegy.  Ultimately, I'm interested in working both in the research and in
the business side.  Regarding looking for research work, I am now literally
in a much better position to consider my options - including Enron.

Alex

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you for your email concerning my paper on EVT and VaR.
I have thought about your question:

If you take formula (2.8) and plug in the parameters (u=10, N_u=56, beta=11.120
chi=0.186, q=0.95, n=108) you get hat(x)=42.86 DM.
Now we only have to explain the minus:
If you look at figure 3, you see that we considered the absolute negative
returns, i.e. we neglected the minus sign of these returns. but in the DRC we
have to pay attention on the minus sign, since we consider returns, not only
absolute returns. this is the reason for the minus in equation (3.10).

I hope I could help you with this explanation.

If you have further questions don't hesitate to ask me.

Sincerely,

Susanne Emmer

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

   Opt4 is currently interviewing for two software engineering positions.
   Our
   needs currently center on Java and integrating Java with Oracle,
   WebLogic,
   and XML.  Your son looks like he may have background in those specific
   frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration needs
   in a
   few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new
   interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job descriptions
   and
   forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in
   Mathematica
   (for the time being), but we have a full team.  If you son's work took
   him
   into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in his
   ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who know
   how
   to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system designers
   at
   IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro
   hard
   drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to
   him.

   Can you meet for dinner Monday or Wednesday night in Boston?

I am sorry for this lateness.

This coming winter break (Dec. 14 - Jan. 2), I am planning to go back to
my country to spend some time with my family. While I am staying there, I
would like to collect as much as information possible in the internet
traffic area. There are a lot of research going on in Korean
Universities, so I can get clearer idea in my language which can shorten
my research time.
I will call you when I come back to U.S.
Thank you.

Cc:	Arnold, John; Issler, Paulo; Barkley, Tom; Lu, Zimin; Maggi, Mike; Moon, Eric; Kaminski, Vince J
Subject:	OStrip Function

As you know, the Ostrip Functionality has been altered.  This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options.  The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked.  Let me explain.  The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs:

NowToSet 	- Fixed Price = zero
		- Forward Start = days from now until strike is set

BegDays	- Fixed Price = days from now until start of option
		- Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option

EndDays	- Fixed Price = days from now until end of option
		- Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option

FwdStFlag	- Fixed Price = 0
		- Forward Start = 1

The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option).  It assumes the option is set right now.  The ""Old Ostrip Model"" did not overlook this input.  This is the problem.  In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same.  Thus when the ""Old Ostrip Model"" incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly.  When the ""New Ostrip Model"" was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.

Larryoptmodel has to be changed to reflect the above inputs.  It is actually only a change to one date.  This date will be used in calculating the three days above.  If the option is a fixed price option then the date will be today and NowToSet will be Today minus Today (zero), BegDays will be Start of Option minus today, EndDays will be End of Option minus today.  If the option is a forward start option, then the date will be when the strike is set and the NowToSet with be the strike setting date minus today, BegDays will be Start of Option minus the strike date, EndDays will be the End of Option minus strike date.

It is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first.  If there was a problem with the ""Old Ostrip Model"" then the trader should have been notified right away.  This could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading.  In this case, however, Larry had figured a way around this problem and he was valuing correctly.  When the model was changed, that changed the larryoptmodel valuation and now it was being valued incorrectly.  Either way, any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away.  Any changes to the models should be communicated to the traders before they are made.

Please let me know if any have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John

To:		All EBS Employees Worldwide

From:		EBS Office of the Chairman

Subject:	Changes at EBS

Date:		July 12, 2001

Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercial efforts.

To achieve this, we will take the following steps:

EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  
North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS.

The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by July 27.

These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.

"RE: EPRM","Hello Chris,

Thanks for your message.  The first two pages look like an good opening to an article on
a spark spread option.

A few comments.

1. A spark spread model has two primary uses. It can be used for pricing stand alone options
traded in the OTC markets and also can be used as foundation stone for a real options valuation
model of a generation plant.

Hi Vince,
 
Hope you are well? Les enjoyed his visit with you  very much by the sound of things.
 
I was wondering if you could have a quick look over  the 2 pages attached. Robin is looking for something in the next day or so and  this is as far as I've got today. The article is going to be on spark spread  options. The material attached is the opening blurb - we'll add some analysis  under different models tomorrow - I just wanted to make sure you are comfortable  with the general comments we had written so far. If you want to add anything  then that would be great - pls feel free to add a few points that we can expand  on.
 
Thanks a lot. Its a shame you can't be here for the  Risk conference in a few weeks, we could have had a reunion dinner!
 
Best regards.
 
Chris.

It must be great to be a management guru and never be wrong.


Before (excerpts from Leading the Revolution):

*	""Want to build a great Internet portal site?  Sorry, its too late.  If you're an incumbent like Sony or Bertelsmann and you want to grab a few million eyeballs online, you're going to have to write a check to for a zillion dollars or so and give it to a twenty-something kid who's managing a company that is haemorrhaging cash.  Or maybe you'll get lucky and Yahoo! will buy you.""

*	""Never has incumbency been worth less. . . . The Internet has turned bricks and mortar into millstones.  And venture capitalists pour millions of dollars into terrorist training camps for industry insurgents.""

*	""Consumers aren't going to spend the rest of their lives wandering the soulless canyons of Wal-Mart to save a couple of bucks on a hammer. . . . And all those ""big box"" retailers afloat in a sea of asphalt will one day find themselves out of the Internet-enabled revolution.  With only one or two exceptions, there is not a single market leader in the offline retailing world that leads its category online.  Most of the old-line companies just didn't move quickly enough.""

*	""Go to any grocery retailer and ask to see its strategic plan from a few years back.  I'll bet there's no mention of Bechtel as a potential competitor.  Yet the world's largest construction company is helping Webvan, a start-up build a new distribution infrastructure that will support the home delivery of groceries ordered online.""

*	""Administrators posses an exaggerated confidence in great execution, believing this is all you need to succeed in a discontinuous world.""

I assume that the next edition of Gary's book will contain a few more caveats and qualifiers such as "". . . but don't be dumb.""

Features/E-Corp/The Think Tank; Inside The Revolution Smart Mover, Dumb Mover Think the first-mover advantage is a myth?
You're wrong: Most pioneering dot-coms failed not because they were first but because they were dumb.
Gary Hamel

09/03/2001
Fortune Magazine
Time Inc.
Page 191
(Copyright 2001)
I'm not fond of business aphorisms. Bigger is better, content is king, own the customer, cannibalize yourself--these are just a few of the cliches that trivialize complex business issues. Another is the idea of first-mover advantage, with its promise of extraordinary rewards for any company that is first to market with a new service or product. At the height of dot-com mania, first-mover advantage was a near-sacred mantra for VCs and entrepreneurs alike. E-commerce zealots argued that early success would compound even more quickly on the Web than in the dawdling old economy. Being first to build a consumer brand in a new category (Amazon), invent a new business model (eBay), or achieve critical mass (what Webvan was hoping to do) were seen as surefire routes to Midas-like profits.

In reality, of course, first-mover advantages proved illusory. For most dot-com startups, being first was simply a way to lose more, faster.  Many pundits began to argue that being a fast follower was a better strategy than trying to be the leader. Old-economy CEOs, eager to avoid the hard work of strategic innovation, seized upon this diagnosis to justify their instinctive fear of novelty. Suddenly, timidity was heralded as a virtue.

But the fast-follower advocates had it wrong as well. Most Internet companies failed not because they were first movers but because they were dumb movers. What companies should learn from the Internet debacle is not that being first is a dangerous form of hubris but that being dumb seldom succeeds. When it comes to trailblazing, there are at least three ways to be a dumb mover--none of which is unique to Internet startups.

Dumb: Getting your timing wrong   If a company invests faster than it learns, it will over-drive the opportunity and end up with an expensive and embarrassing failure.  That's the fate that befell Apple's pioneering handheld computer, the Newton. Was there a potential market out there for palm computers? Sure.  Could investment and marketing hype alone force the market to develop on Apple's time frame? No. Companies that over-drive an emerging opportunity often under-drive it later on. The initial performance gap, a product of unrealistic expectations and over- investment, produces a rapid retrenchment--and an opening for latecomers.

There is a market-penetration curve for every emerging opportunity.  Typically, this curve has an inflection point: a moment when all the pieces of the business model finally fall into place, customer demand explodes, and the market takes off. For videocassette recorders, the curve began to slope gently upward with the launch of Matsushita's VHS format in the late '70s, yet it would take another seven years for VCRs to find their way into one million American homes. By contrast, the market-penetration curve for Hotmail was a near vertical line, with more than ten million users signing up in the first 18 months. Matsushita ran a marathon. Hotmail ran a sprint. The Apple Newton might have evolved into something Palm-like, but only if Apple had paced itself by spending less, learning faster, and iterating more quickly. Apple blew the handheld opportunity not because it was the first mover but because it was a dumb mover.

Any management team that aspires to be a first mover must ask itself, What race are we running: sprint or marathon? If you try to run a 100-yard sprint like a marathon, you'll be left behind. If you try to run a marathon like a 100-yard sprint, you'll keel over from exhaustion.  So it is critically important to ask some questions: Are there difficult technical hurdles? Does market takeoff depend on the development of complementary products or services? Will a new infrastructure be required? Will customers need to learn new skills or adopt new behaviors? Are there high switching costs for customers? Will competing standards confuse customers? Are there powerful competitors that will seek to delay or derail us? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, a company must be careful not to pour in too many resources too soon; the race is going to be a marathon.

On the other hand, answer yes to all of these questions, and you'll need to sprint out of the starting block: Are the customer benefits clear and substantial? Are there potential network effects that will accelerate takeoff? Are there powerful competitors that will be compelled to follow?

Staying on the optimal penetration curve--neither over-driving nor under-driving an opportunity--is a neat trick, but it's not impossible.  AOL, Sun Microsystems, and Quicken-maker Intuit have all done it at one time or another. Smart movers continually review their initial assumptions about the business model, avoid the premium pricing and narrow market definition that create space for latecomers, move quickly to collaborate with would-be competitors, and outsource to maintain flexibility.

Dumber: Overpaying for market share  The allure of capturing a first-mover advantage often produces a spending orgy among a gaggle of look-alike competitors, each intent on ramping up faster than its rivals. That is exactly what happened in many areas of e-commerce. Services were given away free, ad budgets were doubled and then tripled, and massive investments were made in IT infrastructure--all in the quest of getting bigger, faster. In such cases, it's easy to overpay for market share.

To reap a first-mover advantage, a company must buy market share at a discount. That is, it must be able to buy a big chunk of market share before its competitors figure out just how much that share will yield in future profits. That is possible only if a company has a business idea that is truly original, as did eBay and ICQ (the Israeli company that invented instant messaging and was later acquired by AOL).

The fact is, the Internet didn't produce too much in the way of authentic business-model innovation, but rather too little. And even when an original idea did surface, it didn't stay original for long, thanks to the incessant, incestuous networking among Silicon Valley's venture capital companies. The moral is simple: If you want to profit from a first-mover advantage, you'd better make sure you start with a unique strategic insight that, at least initially, is unattractive to would-be competitors or protected by a wall of patents. Dumb movers swarm; smart movers don't.

Dumbest: Being first with a business model that's DOA  Pets.com. Iridium. Webvan. Northpoint.   Many business models are brain-dead from the get-go. They breathe as long as they are hooked up to the ventilator of investor funds but expire the moment investors swallow their grief and pull the plug. There are two fundamental flaws that can render a business model DOA: a complete misreading of the customer (does she really want to order dog food online?) and utterly unsound economics (there will never be enough petroleum geologists and Arctic explorers to make satellite telephony pay). There's no advantage in being first if the destination ain't worth the trip.

Not that this should be seen as an argument for always staying behind. A stupid idea that fails is hardly an indictment of the notion of first-mover advantage. Think twice before you let someone else's idiocy lull you into believing that being first is always a peril-strewn path.  Ask Fred Smith at FedEx if he was glad to be first in overnight package delivery, or Andy Grove at Intel (microprocessors), or Herb Kelleher at Southwest Airlines (discount air travel), or Pete Kight at CheckFree (online billing and payment), or Jeff Skilling at Enron (energy trading).

I don't believe any company should set out to be a follower, fast or otherwise. Sure, in hindsight, first movers often look dumb, but it would be imprudent to bet that they will always screw up. Indeed, when you look beyond the lunacy of the Internet bubble and consider companies with high-quality management, deep pockets, and real competencies, you find that being first pays off a surprisingly often.

So before you bet against the first mover, you'd be wise to ask yourself, Am I sure the first mover is going to be a slow learner? Will market penetration stay in single digits for some time to come, giving me time to grab customers later on? Will the rate of technology change remain high, creating opportunities for a leapfrog strategy? Will the first mover fail in signing up the most valuable partners? If you can answer yes to all these questions, then you may have the chance to be a
successful second mover.

In the end, the distinction between first mover and fast follower hides more than it reveals. The goal, after all, is not to be first to market in some absolute sense, but to be first to put together the precise combination of features, value, and sound business economics that unlocks a profitable new market. Sometimes the company that does this is the first mover, and sometimes it is not. But it's always the smart mover.

Dear Vince and Stinson,

Today I announced my resignation from Enron. It's been very interesting and exciting 5 years and I enjoyed working with you. But for various reasons I decided that I need a fresh start in a new place. So I am moving to New York to trade crude oil financial derivatives for HETCO. I may stick around for a couple of weeks to finish up some stuff, the management should tell me today what they want. But if I leave today and cannot stop by to say good bye, then good luck to you and thanks for giving me the opportunity to work at Enron. I can be reached at pzadoro@yahoo.com.

Vince,

Thanx for the quick response.  

I really want to provide Jose the opportunity to be heard and discuss theory more than specific details.  A lunch or breakfast informal meeting would suffice.  

If your Karma continues to work, we may start strategically place you on 32 for AGA days or I may keep you for customer negotiations in 4th quarter.

Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce

Subject:	Energy Leader Consulting Generation Evaluator (EGE)

Shirley: 
As requested, herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski.  
The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).  
And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).
    Background
The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread.
Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines.
Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin.
For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.
    EGE Objectives
EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.
    I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).  
    II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.  
    III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.
    Specific EGE Concepts
EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.  
It produces indicative statistics such as:
    a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;
    b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;
    c. the frequency distribution of load level;
    d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;
    e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;
    f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;
    g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and
    h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated).
Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years.
EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001.
EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units.
Other EGE supporting data:
    i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);
    j. actual maximum generating capacity;
    k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);
    l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and
    m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range.
With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.
    The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy
Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy.
Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.
    Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC)
EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities.
ELC transfers its ""knowledge"" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:
    1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.
    2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.
    3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).
    4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron.
The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Mulong

RiskNews Update - week ending 27/4/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions
culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief
investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become
a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor.
Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as
well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves
in May, has yet to be named.

The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial
firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously
underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said
liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods
determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind
positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than
standard VAR.

In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk
have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage
that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take
advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated
in the Basle II capital accord proposals.

Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial
institutions is ?151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30%
of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest
figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan

On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is
likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to
the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank
invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

Please find attached an Excel workbook listing different access groups for Research.  I have marked some users for keeping and deleting.  I'm not sure how you wish to proceed.  You can edit the list as you see fit.  Perhaps we can contact those who have particular groups (e.g. Weather) for updates on their list.

I am generally of the opinion that the lists should be as short as possible.  A directory that Lance and I share with the power group was deleted yesterday but nobody knows who did that.  I hope after this audit is done, we are much less at risk of something that like happening again.

Thanks,

Vince,

Nothing like a real deal to focus our thoughts on JCC.  JA Aichi is an agricultural association that purchases over 200,000kl per year of Heavy A.  They would like Enron to price a JCC swap (our offer) that would help them manage their Oct 2001 to Mar 02 position as given below.  I'd like to see what we could offer given the volumes and term.  We can then compare with the JCC offers shown by MS.  We are checking the credit of this company.

It would be good to put a live deal in front of Shankman that wasn't too huge or of too long term.  Concept of minimizing the cost of our education and testing our hedging strategy for JCC.

Let me know if you need additional info.  I presume that you are fairly far along with evaluation of JCC and that we should be able to derive an offer?  If not, please let me know.  If possible we'd like to send out an offer next week.

thanks.

Joe

Hi, How are you doing ? 

Have received an inquiry form JA Aichi (Different from UNICOOP) in Japan as follows: 

In order to hedge the price of Low Sulphur A, they want to enter the swap based on 
Crude Oil Index or Gas Oil Index, since it has a correlation with the product. 
It would be very appreciated if you could give me a price as following. 

1. Enron sells swap to JA Aichi (Financially Swap settled monthly)
2. Index    : Dubai Crude Oil, Platts Singapore Gas Oil Reg. 0.5% 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

                  Total         20,000 KL (125,787Barrel)

I spoke with Iris last week about something she had submitted to you.  It's about the various models that we've created in the department.  She said that it goes into details we may not want to publicize, but that it might be adaptable for the newsletter.  There's an introductory section, a models section, and recommendations for the future.  I would suggest that we run the introduction, amend the models section to eliminate anything we don't want to say, and omit the final portion.
 
If you are agreeable, I can use all or part of the introduction in today's issue and split up the rest.  It would give us a breather while others are finishing their submissions.  
 
What do you think?
 
Sam

Dear Mr.  Kaminski,
 
I don't know if  you've seen this, but I thought it may be of interest to  you.
A new document has been added to PSerc Document  Archive:
Western States Power Crisis: White  Paper
EPRI
You can view this document by going to:http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/specialepr/westernstatessynthesi1.pdf
There are a number of documents from PSERC researchers  that have also been uploaded toour website (www.p << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/specialepr/westernstatessynthesi1.pdf >> serc.wisc.edu << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu >> ). You can find the  documents in the Publications << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/ >>  folders.  You may be particularly interested in the following new  additions:Testing the Performance of Uniform Price and  Discriminative Auctions << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/2001public/rutgers_tim2.pdf >> .  This paper reports on a series of  laboratory experiments to assess the performance of different electric power  markets with respect to price volatility and average market prices.An Engineering Approach to Monitoring Market Power in  Restructured Markets for Electricity << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/2001public/houstoniaee.pdf >> . This paper  explores the potential for using an engineering approach to measure the  existence of market power in the real-time operations of a power grid and gives  the results of two experiments designed to test the exercise of market  power.
We've also updated the  descriptive information about PSERC. That information is in the General  Information About PSERC  << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/generalinf/aboutpserc/ >> folder.
I am sorry you weren't  able to join us at our last Industrial Advisory Board meeting. You and others  from ENRON are certainly invited to our next meeting which will be December 5-7,  2001 in College Station, TX, hosted by Texas A&M and TXU. We'll send you  more information when it is available.

Vince,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, I am attaching below the URL for
our QCF program here at Georgia Tech for your corporate recruiting folks.
http://www.qcf.gatech.edu/
It will be great if we could have your recruiting people meet with our
first graduating class of the QCF program.

Regarding your visit, we'd be glad to cover the coach airfare and
lodging.  How about the first week of October, say on either 10/2 or 10/4,
or the last week of October, say 10/30?  The arrangement would be that you
come in on the evening of a Monday or a Wednesday and give a seminar on a
Tuesday or a Thursday.  Please let me know what works best for
you.  Thanks.

If you have not yet registered for the June 21-22 conference, please do so
to help our planning and to obtain contact information for you.

I want to remind you that recommended conference attire is business casual.

If you do not have a Stanford parking permit (either by mail or at your
hotel), please drive to the conference facility, park, and obtain one at
the meeting room.  Detailed directions can be found on the website but here
is a summary from Highway 101 North & South:

      Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino
      Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university.
Stay
      in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus.  At the
four-way
     stop, turn right onto Campus Drive.  Take first left (Lasuen Street)
and drive
     to the end and park.  Conference site is at this building.  If you do
not yet have
     a parking permit, we will give you one there.

I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting.
Hill

>ABSTRACT:
> This paper examines the relationship of futures floor trader
> proprietary positions to their market making activities. In
> particular, we examine interdealer trading, its function as an
> inventory management tool, and its costs. In addition, we
> develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy, where some floor
> traders, who are more successful, profit from their trades with
> other dealers. On average, we find that dealers earn relative
> profits when they execute position reducing trades. However, a
> surprising finding is that more successful traders are more
> likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades,
> which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer
> hierarchy. The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster
> and Mann's 1996 article on futures floor trader inventory
> control, and Reiss and Werner's 1998 article on interdealer
> trading. The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits
> from the elaborate futures data, and the highly competitive
> nature of dealer trading on the floor.

>ABSTRACT:
> We investigate whether the volatility risk premium is negative
> by examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option
> portfolios (buy the option and hedge with stock). Within a
> stochastic volatility framework, we demonstrate a correspondence
> between the sign and magnitude of the volatility risk premium
> and the mean delta-hedged portfolio returns. Using a sample of
> S&P 500 index options, we provide empirical tests that have the
> following general results. First, the delta-hedged strategy
> underperforms zero. Second, the documented underperformance is
> less for options away from the money. Third, the
> underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility.
> Fourth, the volatility risk premium significantly affects
> delta-hedged gains even after accounting for jump-fears. Our
> evidence is supportive of a negative market volatility risk
> premium.

>ABSTRACT:
> In this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer
> investors a superior risk-return trade-off. We do so using a
> continuous time version of Dybvig's (1988a, 1988b) payoff
> distribution pricing model. The evaluation model, which does not
> require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution
> of the funds in question, is applied to the monthly returns of
> 77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices over the period May
> 1990-April 2000. The results show that as a stand-alone
> investment hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return
> profile. We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be
> inefficient, with the average efficiency loss amounting to 2.76%
> per annum for indices and 6.42% for individual funds. Part of
> the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified
> away. Funds of funds, however, are not the preferred vehicle for
> this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their
> double fee structure. Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio
> context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation
> outcomes. Seven of the 12 hedge fund indices and 58 of the 72
> individual funds classified as inefficient on a stand-alone
> basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when
> mixed with the S&P 500. The best results are obtained when
> 10-20% of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds

I had a lunch today with Rob Ladd from Duke (company, not university).
He is a Rice graduate and I mentioned to him the seminars that Enron was sponsoring.
He is willing to talk to you about substituting Duke for Enron as a sponsor of the 
seminar program. 

Please, contact him at rtladd@duke-capitalpartners.com.

I am working on the power price time series for you but I may run out of time.

Dear Vince and Stinson,

Today I announced my resignation from Enron. It's been very interesting and exciting 5 years and I enjoyed working with you. But for various reasons I decided that I need a fresh start in a new place. So I am moving to New York to trade crude oil financial derivatives for HETCO. I may stick around for a couple of weeks to finish up some stuff, the management should tell me today what they want. But if I leave today and cannot stop by to say good bye, then good luck to you and thanks for giving me the opportunity to work at Enron. I can be reached at pzadoro@yahoo.com.

Dear Tiger Team Hosts 2002:
Thank you for your interest and commitment to participate in Wharton's Field
Application Project.  With your help, we continue to expand the diversity of
our host representatives. We especially thank those returning hosts, whose
feedback was responsible for several program design changes which we believe
will improve the program. Our goal is to continue to build our partnerships
and to together create changes that benefit all. Feel free to call upon me
to discuss any aspect of the program or special needs. 
As a next step in the process, I am asking that you submit, by email, your
project proposals no later then September 14, 2001
<mailto:FAP@management.wharton.upenn.edu>  These proposals do not have to be
detailed, we just need to know what you are considering. We ask for
proposals at this early date because some hosts have expressed the desire to
get faculty involved early in the process. We think that is a good idea so
faculty will begin to review the proposals in September. This will allow
faculty to get involved earlier in the process and the final project scope
will be more of a host/faculty collaboration. 
As a reminder, projects should be cross-functional in nature with 3, if not
4 of the business function areas; finance, accounting, operations,
marketing, management and strategy. Because of the more integrative nature
of Tiger Teams,  projects should have strategic implications. Faculty will
happily assist hosts in developing these project aspects. 
To ensure that the projects yield significant benefits for all participants,
we ask hosts to appoint at least one on-site contact person to help define
the project objectives, interact with the faculty and student team
representatives. 
Our tentative FAP calendar can be reviewed at the website:
http://fap.wharton.upenn.edu/TigerHost/tiger_host_overview.htm  If there are
only particular dates for which the host representatives are available to
come to campus for the Kick-Off, Mid-Project Review and Final Presentations,
please schedule them as soon as possible, as they will be done on a
first-come, first serve basis.
Feel free to contact us should you have any questions. We look forward to
working with you. Again, thank you for your support of the Wharton School.

Best Regards,

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets	
The Transaction Development group (TD) is responsible for corporate development, transaction execution and portfolio management activities within EIM.  TD is responsible for asset and corporate acquisitions to support EIM's efforts in the Forest Products and Steel industries.  TD works with EIM's Forest Products and Steel Origination groups to structure and execute complex transactions for EIM's customers.

Enron Freight Markets
Enron Freight Markets has continued to expand the transportation services offered to its customers and completed several flatbed truck moves outbound from Georgia this week.  There was a shortage of flatbed equipment supply in this market and EFM was able to obtain more than three times the normal margin on each move.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

"RE: Note on Valuation","Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

"RE: Exotica's different versions","Bjorn,

I don't think the scope of the project is really that big. When we looked
into it, it seemed like a relatively minor issue. 

To me, it's  really a matter of routine maintenance that should not be
an equivalent of a Desert Storm operation.

Zimin and I will call Slava on Tuesday and determine what has to be done.

Hi Bjorn,

some time ago we, you, Stinson and I, had a meeting in Houston regarding having the same versions for Houston and London.

We agreed that you would talk to Ted Murphy to get his support for this project. I know that Ted did not come to Houston at the time he planned and therefore you were not able to talk to him (you were on holidays when he came to Houston).

This project is really big (several man month work) and we cannot do this without Ted's support. You know that requests from RAC are always taken very seriously.

Please, could you talk to Ted to get his support.

many thanks,

Slava

Subject:	Days of Caring - Details of Cleaning Project

Gentlemen/Ladies,

I've been asked by Julie Clyatt to help coordinate the volunteer assignments and materials for the cleaning projects at the Center for the Retarded on August 10th.  

Project Assignments
There are actually three cleaning projects - all require volunteers in the morning and/or afternoon.  The details of the projects are below:

Project 268 - Clean glass throughout solarium and shade house.
Project 275 - Clean all interior windows on floors 2 through 6 (70-80 windows in common areas) in Cullen Residence Hall.
Project 279 - Clean ground floor windows (109 inside and 165 outside) in Cullen Residence Hall.

When you get to the site there will be an orientation in the auditorium for all volunteers at the the Center.  Everyone will then disperse to their different projects.  There are not enough total volunteers for to cover all of the cleaning projects listed above so just choose which one you'd like to do and you'll be directed to that area.

Materials Required by Volunteers

The only materials required to be brought by the volunteers are boxes of Latex Gloves (1 box each project) and for Project 268,  two 100' heavy duty water hoses.  Can anyone bring these?

Logistics

You probably already have this but just a reminder....

Transportation: Shuttles will be provided to take you to and from the site.  Loading and unloading of buses will be on Shaw Street, between the Antioch Church and 3 Allen parking lot.  Morning shifts will leave at 8:15am and return to Enron at 11:30am.  Afternoon shifts will leave at 1:00 and return at 4:00pm.

Food:  The volunteer appreciation lunch will be from 11:00am - 1:00pm via the Big E Cafe.  Lunches will be provided by Chick-Fil-A.  

Water:   Water and ice will be provided at the Enron building before the buses leave.  Please bring coolers from home to load the water.  

T-Shirts:  T-shirts can be picked up at EB 1624.  T-shirts will also be available while loading the buses.


Thanks,
Marilyn

       a. We would be delighted to have him here.
       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives
           your blessing before we can move ahead.
    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and
    Mike Roberts.
 
  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you
      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and 
      asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was
      told you were out sick.
 
 3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next
     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.
 
 4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to
     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not 
     bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.
 
     I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the
     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.
 
I hope it helps. Cheers.
 
 
Vince

I have spoken to Christian and explained to him that he is critical to our local operations and should provide 100% focus on his role here.  As a small office it would be devestating for us should Christian be lured away.  I would appreciate you calling me rather than working through Christian on this matter.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

a summer intern last summer in the research group, and attended the
hiring event this year at Stanford. In that occasion I had an informal
offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a
written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not
received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is
still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the
process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before
I make my final decision.

Thanks in advance,

Vince,

A couple of brief issues:

1) I have been asked to deliver a lecture(s) to a Rice environmental engineering class in the fall.  Most of the preparatory work for the class is already complete, so I don't foresee any large time commitment for this endeavor.  If there is a problem, let me know.

2) A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering.  I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies.  I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem.

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and

the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Hope you are well? Les enjoyed his visit with you  very much by the sound of things.
 
I was wondering if you could have a quick look over  the 2 pages attached. Robin is looking for something in the next day or so and  this is as far as I've got today. The article is going to be on spark spread  options. The material attached is the opening blurb - we'll add some analysis  under different models tomorrow - I just wanted to make sure you are comfortable  with the general comments we had written so far. If you want to add anything  then that would be great - pls feel free to add a few points that we can expand  on.
 
Thanks a lot. Its a shame you can't be here for the  Risk conference in a few weeks, we could have had a reunion dinner!
 
Best regards.

However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
Thank you.

Subject:	KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*	a general energy risk related topic
*	a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*	your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Vince,

I took the curve shift P&L from the RMS database and prompt month volatility for both GAS and POWER for the period of Aug-2000 to Aug-2001.
In case POWER, volatility has relationship with VAR but less likely with P&L.  For GAS volatility, the correlation with VAR is weaker than the case of POWER and also low relationship with P&L.

   
Thanks.

I thought that I would take the liberty to summarize our request after our meeting this morning:

Volatilities per commodity
Electricity
Natural Gas
Crude Oil (strip proxy?)
Aluminum (strip proxy?)
Copper (stip proxy?)
Fixed Income (US 10 year treasuries as a proxy?)
Equities (S&P 500 as a proxy?)
Currencies ($, yen or DM as a proxy)
Cross correlation matrix for each commodity with every other commodity
Correlation of power and gas volatility to Enron's trading earnings
Comparable analysis of Enron ROVAR to other trading organizations (e.g. banks, hedge funds, etc..)
Analysis of amount of economic capital versus cash in order to support a certain VAR


If there is anything that we can do in order to help with the request, please let me know.  Again thank you very much for all of your help.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Subject: Participation in power market experiment

Cornell is running some national experiments on market design. They need
volunteers from industry. They need a response today if someone wants to
participate in the first round of experiments. But anyone interested should
just apply soon because there will be more. You get paid for it, too,
depending upon your profitability.
FYI

This is an invitation to participate in a set of electric power market
experiments pertaining to the design and efficiency of markets for electric
power using a unique internet platform called PowerWeb.  We are interested
in testing several important markets with subjects at disparate
locations.  You are being asked to either participate yourself or to pass
this invitation on to the appropriate person in your organization.

We are interested in testing individuals or institutions with experience in
the power industry. Participants will compete in a series of four
electricity market experiments. The commitment required will be to review
approximately two hours of training material and then to participate in
two, two-hour sessions during times chosen from those specified in the
attached registration form.  Those chosen to participate must be able to be
simultaneously logged on to the internet and connected to a voice telephone
line.  They must also use a Netscape web browser that we will provide if
you don't have one.  Subjects must also be able to be paid for their
participation.

You will earn approximately $350-$450 for participating in the experiments.
Actual earnings are directly related to your performance. You will only be
paid what you earn if you complete all four experiments.  In the
experiments, you will play the role of an electricity generator and compete
against 5 other generators (participants) to sell electricity in a market.
In the market, the 6 generators submit offers to sell electricity and an
auction mechanism determines the selling price(s) and what capacity is
sold. No prior experience trading in electric power markets is
required.  We will use the results of these experiments to help determine
how player strategies and market characteristics change as the market rules
change.  You will receive feedback at the end of the experiments about the
results and what was learned..

To participate, completely fill out the registration form attached to this
email and send it to Christian Vossler at cav22@cornell.edu. On the form,
it is very important that you indicate times when you will be available to

Gentlemen:
	Lance did a very good job last Friday presenting
his ERCOT work to the people here at the University of 
California Energy Institute.
	Severin Borenstein invited us to put the paper on
the UCEI website as a POWER working paper when we get it
finished.  I think this would be a very good idea.
What do you think?  Of course, we can (simultaneously)
submit it for publication to IEEE PES.

Vince,

In the morning we were talking about the El Paso candidate who thinks he is above something and is not
willing to take certain project or responsibility.   In real life, we also occasionally have similar stiuation. (an
example is attached).

I would like to have your guidance when such a situation occurs.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this ""extra"" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Dear Mr Kaminski,

I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you
concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again
this year - brilliant!

I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper
again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your
contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.

To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the (""technical"")
topics that are already covered:



Chris  Strickland: Forward Curve Models with Jumps for the Pricing of
Exotic Energy  Contracts

   multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts
   adding jumps
   applying the models to  exotic energy options
   extensions to multiple  energy contracts

Gas  Supply Agreements

   Structures of  Gas Supply Agreements (GSA)
   Relationships  between Physical and Virtual Power Stations (PPS/VPS)
   Valuation  methods for GSA's and VPS's
   Risk Analysis of GSA's  and VPS's



Derek Bunn, Professor of Decision  Sciences, LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL:

   Establishing  and valuing the key factors using a bottom up approach
   Looking at  the interconnection between key factors
   The treatment of the risk  of infrequent but high impact events

   What is  Credit Risk?
   Major changes  in the industry and their impact on Credit Risk
   Effects of  new risk profiles on credit appetite: Credit analysis; Limit
   Setting; Risk  Reducing Structures
   Importance of Credit in  the Organizational Structure: Reporting;
   Dependence; Structure of Credit  Department

Brett  Humphreys: Examining Cutting-Edge Credit Exposure Mitigation Tools:

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured
contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001
speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)
would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else
that has not been covered  yet.

I look forward to hearing  from you,

I interviewed this fellow, who I understood worked for EES last year, and I found him to be very competent and the Economics Chairman thinks he walks on water.  He interviewed for a spot in Gas Load Forecasting but Shawn Chmil is passing on him due to lack of actual experience in load forecasting.

If anyone needs a very bright (top of the class) economics/stat candidate then please call me, ext 39464.

Vince-

Good news. Martin's box is working wonderfully- I'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday.

This was (another) nice deal for Enron. We save $21,000 in real money this way, the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server, using a box that wasn't being used by anyone. I'm happy about this.

RiskNews Update - week ending 27/4/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions
culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief
investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become
a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor.
Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as
well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves
in May, has yet to be named.

The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial
firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously
underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said
liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods
determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind
positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than
standard VAR.

In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk
have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage
that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take
advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated
in the Basle II capital accord proposals.

Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial
institutions is ?151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30%
of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest
figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan

On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is
likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to
the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank
invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.

"FW: ERCOT TCR votes","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Lin, Martin  
Sent:	Wednesday, October 31, 2001 1:15 PM
To:	Shanbhogue, Vasant
Cc:	Kaminski, Vince J
Subject:	ERCOT TCR votes

Lance and I participated in the Wholesale Market Subcommittee (WMS) meeting at ERCOT yesterday.  WMS was meeting to vote on various aspects of the proposed TCR design.  I'm happy to report that most votes went our way and the vote we lost does not matter significantly to Enron.

The following is a brief summary of issues and the votes.

1.  Derating
We oppose derating.  I presented a few PowerPoint slides to advocate our position.  Amorng the proposals were:
a)  issue 100% of the commercially significant constraint (CSC) limit with non-deratable TCRs
b)  issue 100% of the CSC limit, but with deratable TCRs
c)  issue < 100% of the CSC limit with non-deratable TCRs
d)  issue X% of the CSC limit as non-deratable and 100-X % as deratable.
WMS selected option (a), where 60% of the total would be made available in the annual auction and the remainder would be auctioned off monthly.  All TCRs would be non-deratable.

2.  Closely Related Elements
The CSC is a single line.  The proposition is to introduce closely related elements (CREs) to create a flowgate equivalent for the CSC.  There were several votes on how to develop the CREs, if allowed, and what to do about certain units that would complicate congestion management with CREs.  We were satisfied with the decision to allow CREs, have them determined in advance of the year (as is done with the CSCs), and to prohibit certain units from participating in the balancing energy market when they fall between the CSC and a CRE.

3.  TCR Primary Auction single party quantity limit
Should a single entity be allowed to acquire the entire lot of TCRs available in an auction?  We think so.  If a party is willing to pay more than anybody else for the TCRs, that party should be allowed to have them.  Since TCRs have no value beyond the realized congestion, there is always the alternative to simply pay the congestion.  If all TCRs are held by one party who wishes to charge excessive prices for them, everybody would opt to pay congestion.  The only game potential is that a party with market power in balancing energy can manipulate price spreads and gain from the TCR position.  This is a result of TCRs being financial and can be done whether the party with market power holds all TCRs or not.  Furthermore, there is no way to enforce limited ownership in the secondary market, so a party wishing to control all TCRs can buy them in the secondary market or gain effective financial control.  We lost to vote to allow for complete ownership, but this provision has little effect on the market anyway.

This analysis was another swag at p&l components. We took the numbers from the daily position reports, backed out the big originations that we new about (e.g. peakers sales) and the other ""mistakes"" (e.g. the EES $700MM loss), then took out the curve-shift P&L from the backtest data, the balance we said must be some form of ""new deal"" P&L plus realised p&l etc.
It shows that 2000 was the prop trading year, whereas 2001 was mainly new deals. Of course the whole thing is poisoned by reserve movements.

Subject: Does this sound familiar?


Thought you would enjoy this!


There were these two elderly people living in a  Florida 
mobile home park. He was a widower and she a widow. 
They had known  one another for a number of years. 

Now, one evening there was a community  supper in the big 
activity center. These two were at the same table, across  
from one another. As the meal went on, he made a few admiring 
glances at  her and finally gathered up his courage to ask her, 
""Will you marry  me?"" 

After about six seconds of 'careful consideration,' she answered. 
""Yes. Yes, I will."" 

The meal ended and with a few more pleasant exchanges, they 
went to their respective places. 

Next  morning, he was troubled. ""Did she say 'yes' or did she 
say 'no'?"" He  couldn't remember. Try as he would, he just 
could not recall.    Not even a faint memory. 

With trepidation, he went to the telephone and called  her. 
First, he explained to her that he didn't remember as well as 
he used  to. Then he reviewed the lovely evening past.     As 
he gained a little more  courage, he then enquired of her, ""When 
I asked if you would marry me, did  you say 'Yes' or did you 
say 'No'?"" 

He was delighted to hear her say,  ""Why, I said, 'Yes, yes I will' 
and I meant it with all my heart."" Then she  continued, ""And I 
am so glad that you called, because I couldn't remember  who had 
asked me.""

Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.

We are still planning trips to California and New Mexico that we would like to combine

"RE: tech corner article summarizing MBA students reports","Kal,

This is the first draft based on what students from Rice working on a project
produced. Of course, they were free to say what they thought.

Our objective is to modify the article  to such an extent that
it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms
in the energy industry.
It would be only for internal consumption and it should be  a useful source of information 
for Enron employees.


Ken Parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper.

Vince -- Even if we post this internally, I have some concern about the heading of this article and with the section with recommendations for EnronOnline.  Is this something we really need to do?  If so, pls. let me know since we'll have to edit some of the text and make it very clear that this is simply an article written by some students outside Enron and Enron does not agree or disagree with the content.  We would also have to add a note that this article is for internal use only.  We can discuss and finalize on Tues.

Bob,

Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
about EOL from which we extracted this article.
We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
be running our ""New Era"" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

Last January we contacted Prof. Myers at MIT about presenting a project for the proseminar of Financial Engineering. He contacted me today about the proseminar saying that Enron could propose something.

We (at the weather desk) think about proposing some kind of weather bond. The idea is to create awareness of the weather market rather than the specific structure. We would propose a simple structure (with educational purposes).

Let me know your thoughts about this idea.

Kim,

I met Paul Y'barbo today (I have known him for ages)
and he mentioned an interview with you. 

He is a very bright and capable individual and he would
be a good fit to your group. 

Vince


P.S.  He looks better without the pony tail.

Guys

Next week we're planning on recalibrating the dummified regression models (""placement models"") built earlier this year and last for the Enron Credit pricing system. These basically have the objective of predicting a 5-yr CDS price for an illiquid name, based on available data. This data consists of:
Credit Ratings, Outlook and Watch
Equity based data - eg, EDF, 90d Volatility, Beta, Market Cap, Dividend yield, PE ratio
Financial ratios - eg, EBITDA interest coverage, Current ratio, EPS, Debt to Assets
Descriptive Info - Country and Industry

I've outlined the methodology used for the models thus far in the attached docs:

   
We're kicking off this effort next week with a brainstorming session with the trading desk, to outline areas of deficiency and proposed model improvements. From the quantitative side we'd appreciate greatly if any or all of you could read these docs and offer any suggestions for improvement of the models. Any ideas on statistical techniques or the overall methodology will be welcome. I'd also be happy to set up meetings or just talk on the phone if any further explanation is required.

Regards

Ben

Bob Brookswill be in Houstonnext week from Tuesday, August 28 through Thursday, August 30.  A few time slots are available on Thursday the 30th in the late morning and early afternoon.  Please contact Bob at 323-663-4831 or by e-mail at rebrooks@rbac.com  if you would like to schedule an appointment.
 
From http://www.enerfaxgold.com :
 
Oil Companies Find Output Targets Elusive  
    Big oil companies are failing to meet production growth targets because 
they are using up mature fields faster than they can find and develop big 
enough new ones to replace them, according to analysts. ExxonMobil, Shell, 
and Chevron have all missed output targets, despite the incentive of two 
years of high oil prices. ExxonMobil planned a 3% annual growth target last 
year but its output for the second quarter of 2001 was flat versus a year 
ago. Shell reported that its 2nd quarter production increased by only 1%, 
well short of the 5% target. Depletion from existing oil fields runs at an 
average rate of about 5% per year, and that has to be replaced by an 
equivalent amount of new production just to keep output steady. From 1998 to 
2000 the six biggest publicly traded companies largely failed to replace the 
oil and natural gas they produced with new reserves, after stripping out the 
effect of acquisitions and revisions, according to Andersen management 
consulting. BP posted one of the best performances, replacing 200% of its 
natural gas production and 86% of its oil. Shell replaced only 42% of its 
natural gas and 55% of its oil, according to Andersen. BP has set the most 
ambitious production growth target of 5.5% for this year up 7% for the longer 
term.
 
From http://www.enerfax.com (Sunday, August 19, 2001):
 
Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower
    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.064 lower Friday to $3.303 per MMBtu as traders squared short positions now that Tropical Storm Chantal will miss the GulfCoast. The October contract lost $0.081 to $3.334 per MMBtu. Tropical Storm Chantal will affect the YucatanPeninsulaearly this week and then move into the central Gulf but is a nonevent. Some traders wanted their positions cleared in preparation for next week's AGA storage report as they do not trust last week's reported build of just 3 Bcf, and believe that the AGA may report a higher build this week to compensate. A lot of traders got burned by last week's report and are beginning to doubt the whole system. But, others look at the data as just a one-week blip brought about by a crescendo of events that no longer exist and do represent not a long-term shift. However, if Wednesday's AGA injection is low again this week, look for the market to rally to a higher level, but in the meantime it will be controlled by the storm entering the Gulf of Mexico. Look for support in the $3.15-$3.20 range and again at $3.00. Resistance is pegged at $3.40 and again around $3.60. Natural gas for next day delivery across the USand Canadawas generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.20 to $3.24 per MMBtu.
 
Gulf South Hold Open Season for Gulf Pines Pipeline 
    
    Gulf South Pipeline is planning to build a pipeline extending from MobileBayto North Carolinaif it receives enough interest. An open season for capacity on the Gulf Pines Pipeline is being currently being held. Gulf South Pipeline, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, is owned by Entergy-Koch. If completed, Gulf Pines would be 600 - 700 miles long, and would extend through Georgia, South Carolinaand North Carolina. Anticipating an in-service date of summer 2004, Gulf South is soliciting binding and non-binding bids for capacity on Gulf Pines through September 19th. The pipeline would offer an interconnection with Gulf South near MobileBay, allowing customers to source supply from Texasand Louisianaas well as from MobileBay. The Gulf South system also offers links to major storage and supply hubs.
 
Gas Daily reports this proposed pipeline may have a capacity of 1 bcf per day.  It also gives the following website for additional information:  http://www.gulfpinespipeline.com .
 
Natural Gas Market Ponders Storage Report
  
    While some were questioning the accuracy of this week's astonishingly low natural gas storage report, others blamed Tropical Storm Barry and higher demands from new power generation load. However, both the futures and cash markets jumped. Futures closed up $0.374 the day the report was announced, and the cash market rose $0.20 - $0.40 the day after. Some chose to not believe the 3 Bcf storage fill reported by the AGA, chalking it up to bad data. The average amount injected during a week in August is over 60 Bcf. The prior week's fill was 80 Bcf. Factoring in Barry and the prolonged heat wave that week, the market had been expecting a somewhat lower number, but all had predicted something above 50 Bcf. There are various reports and theories. Buyers for northeastern utilities said they had all injected and were shocked by the minus 12 Bcf storage number reported for the East. They could not entirely dismiss it, however. They noted that in the last 4 years all the new plants that have been built are natural gas only facilities. Last week could have been a good indication of what that could mean to the market. The AGA says they checked and re-checked when they came up with the unbelievable number. The AGA's numbers have always lined up with the more extensive EIA reports. It is possible that a number of factors came together all at once, with the impact of Barry on production and an higher generation loads because of Eastern heat wave. However, the curve in the cash market has been going down. That may mean that if there is a market opportunity to move volumes from storage to a consumer right now, that could be done, assuming 4 or 5 weeks later it could be replaced at the same price or maybe even less. Also, there is speculation that the pipelines were re-packing their lines with volumes out of storage because of a sudden draw down.

no skills required in my group. I was impressed with her excellent

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you so very much for your time on Wednesday. It has been
challenging to find out, from the outside, exactly what your group does
on a daily basis and what type of people make up your team. I do not
feel that there is any substitute for the information, and feel, that
one can get directly from the source itself, thank you for making your
team available to meet with me as well.

You mentioned that the Associate Program at Enron could be a great
starting point for me to acquire the business skills and experience that
I seek. I would be a most enthusiastic candidate as I have looked into
the program, and I too, feel that it would be an exciting and logical
starting point for me.

It is my understanding that in order for me to enter the program I would
require sponsorship. Would you be able to sponsor me for this program?
If so, I have attached my cv (as a Word '97 document) and understand
that the person to be contacted with a nomination would be Mr Jeff Davis
in Human Resources. Please let me know if there is anything further that
I can do to realize my goal of working within Enron while gaining
business skills and experience.
It was a pleasure speaking with you.

Thank you again for your help and encouragement.

Sincerely,
Dr. Marilyn Mielke

Vince, 
I've ended up interviewing 20 people in the Research Group; everyone was very cooperative and insightful.  Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned.
When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.
Thanks again for your interest and support.  I'll keep you informed of progress!

I am a quick learner and a willing learner and feel that
I would be able to assist you a great deal with the Estate.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Dear Vince,

I have attached the invoice for the workshop that Beth O'Sullivan and I
conducted for your group last month as well as a summary of the workshop
evaluation.  I am sorry for the delay, but we were waiting to receive more
of the workshop evaluations so that we could provide you a more complete
assessment of the workshop by the attendees.  As it is, we only collected
11 responses of the 17 attendees.

I will also send you a copy of this invoice in the mail and will be glad to
send you the actual evaluation forms completed by the attendees if you
would like to have them.

As mentioned in the attached, we enjoyed working with your group and hope
that you can see the difference the training made in the presentation
ability of the attendees.

If you have any questions about the attached invoice, please do not
hesitate to call me at 713-348-5394.

Again, thanks for bringing us in to conduct the workshop.  I sincerely hope
that you are well despite any changes taking place around you and that you
have a great Thanksgiving holiday.

Dinner Mon evening would be great. I could come into Enron before hand and
show your group our soon to be released energy derivatives software if you
like?

I've attached a slightly updated draft of the article.

Subject:	 

Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Frank

Subject:  KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Iris

I have just had  confirmation of your acceptance as a Securities and Financial Derivatives Representative by the SFA.  The confirmation document will be maintained on your SFA file here in Compliance - please let me know if you would like a copy for your own records (are you still in London?)

Please note that any future events that may effect your registration status (change of departments, job change/promotion etc) should be discussed in the first place, with your immediate supervisor to see whether your existing registration is sufficient for your new role.  Registration as an SFDR allows you to carry out the duties of a registered representative in relation to any investment or security for which Enron has been authorised by the SFA with the exception of commodity derivatives.  If you did move to one of the commodity desks based within the UK, then you would need to upgrade your registration by passing the 'commodity derivatives' module and becoming a General Representative.  If doubt remains please contact either myself or Jonathan Marsh (SFA Compliance Officer) for further advice.  Other factors such as change of personal address, events that may effect your good reputation and character (please see the attachments to this message), transfer to a different Enron office etc should be advised to Jonathan Marsh (SFA Compliance Officer) or me as soon as practicable.

As your registration was the result of a transfer, I would be grateful if you could complete the attached qusetionnaire relating to your 'good reputation and character'.  We require all our SFA representatives to submit this upon first registration and thereafter on an annual basis.

Opt4 is currently interviewing for two software engineering positions.  Our
needs currently center on Java and integrating Java with Oracle, WebLogic,
and XML.  Your son looks like he may have background in those specific
frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration needs in a
few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new
interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job descriptions and
forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in Mathematica
(for the time being), but we have a full team.  If you son's work took him
into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in his
ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who know how
to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system designers at
IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro hard
drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to him.

Can you meet for dinner Monday or Wednesday night in Boston?

Dear Vincent,

I am one of the organizers of the SIAM conf.  where you gave a presentation.
I missed your talk but I talked to you just after your presentation. I
wonder if I could get a copy of your PP slides.

On a related matter. Would you consider to give a talk at Rice at my
seminar, taking to applied and statistics audience? I would be happy to
arrange for your visit.

Yours,

Petr

"RE: Would anyone be interested?....","Brian,

It sounds great. I know from personal experience that it's much better to develop
a new technology quietly and test it before everybody develops high expectations.
If you don't manage the management, they will give you zero credit
for the idea, and a lot of grief for slow deployment.

I see the usefulness of this technology in many places where we trade power.

Is it OK to consult one my associates (Martin Lin) and  ask him for his
opinion? He knows infinitely more about transmission than I do.

A lunch / dinner at a Sardinian restaurant would be great.
I spent a summer in Sardinia in 1970.

Subject:	Would anyone be interested?....

Greetings Vince!
	During the brief idle moments we have here in the lab, I have been pondering yet another possible project.  We have built sensor boards and written programs to calculate the current flow along High Voltage Direct Current lines, the type that form the Western Inter-tie.    There are six of these lines to the west, i.e. to the WSCC  - four between WSCC and MAPP and two between WSCC and SPP.  It would seem to me to be valuable to know when there there power supply differences between these NERC regions and when power was flowing between them.  (In this case, directionality is no problem.  For once there is actually something flowing!)  Of course if this is useful, the project could expand to other inter-regional zones.  HVDC lines exist in the northeast between the large Canadian hydro projects and the metropolitan cities in New England.  Globally, there are several large grids being formed - one in Scandinavia, one in North Africa, an East Russian/Chinese system and a Russian/Korean/Japanese system.  Naturally these have to connect internally with DC lines as there are power frequency, power reliability and power control differences between each of the generating countries.
	You are the first person that I have told about this.  I didn't want to get anyone, especially my immediate supervisors, excited about a technology that I wasn't ready to provide.  I know that once I say that we could do it, the powers that be will want it NOW.  If you think that there is a market for this imformation I'll sneak out some weekend and collect a bit of data.  The nearest HVDC inter-tie is just north of Dallas so testing it would only take a day or two.  I am currently juggling two running chainsaws, a rabid dog and three vial of hepatitis so one more item in the mix won't make much of a difference at this point.  If no one needs to info, I'll just put the hardware and software on the shelf.

p.s.  Gina and I would like to take you out to lunch or dinner soon to a Sardinian restaurant.  Let us know when you would be free.  ( Your wife is invited, of course!)

Subject:	Neptune

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

Thank you for your help,

Additionally, I've attached a spreadsheet showing correlations as Kevin suggested.  Using price change shows stronger correlations between gas and power.  However, incorporating this into value-at-risk may create additional issues.

	Hopefully while in London I will have time to work on it some more.

	Your comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Opt4 is currently interviewing for two software engineering positions.  Our
needs currently center on Java and integrating Java with Oracle, WebLogic,
and XML.  Your son looks like he may have background in those specific
frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration needs in a
few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new
interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job descriptions and
forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in Mathematica
(for the time being), but we have a full team.  If you son's work took him
into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in his
ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who know how
to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system designers at
IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro hard
drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to him.

Can you meet for dinner Monday or Wednesday night in Boston?

Dear Vince and Christie,

 

I hope that you are both well, and are ready for the onset of summer in Houston!  I was disappointed that I was not able to see you at the final Tiger Team presentations last month due to a family emergency.  I hope that the teams' analyses will be helpful to your work, and echo their appreciation of your involvement and support.

 

I am writing with a question regarding recruiting for Enron's weather risk management group.  My boyfriend, Greg Hunt, is currently seeking opportunities to combine his background in meteorology (MS and 2 years of research at Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab) and an MBA in finance and information technology.  I began thinking about Enron's work in weather derivatives, and realized that there could possibly be a great fit there.

 

I have copied Greg on this message, and would appreciate any suggestions you can offer regarding opportunities in this group.  Thank you very much!

 

Best regards,

 

Heather

Vince, 

I hope all is well with you considering ...

Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM.  She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached a link to the hospital's webite that has her picture (she is much cuter in person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chicago Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

AEP COMPLETES PURCHASE OF HOUSTON PIPE LINE COMPANY FROM ENRON
COLUMBUS, Ohio - American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) announced that it has completed its purchase of the stock of Houston Pipe Line Company (HPL), an intrastate natural gas pipeline subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE).  The acquisition includes inventory and a 30-year pre-paid lease related to the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility.  The $726.6 million for the transaction will be raised by issuing a non-controlling, preferred equity interest to private investors.  

The purchase, announced Jan. 11, 2001, was completed following clearance from the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. HPL owns, or leases, and operates one of the most extensive and flexible natural gas gathering, transportation and storage operations in Texas. HPL's intrastate system includes more than 4,400 miles of pipe with capacity of approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet per day and the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility, one of the largest storage facilities in North America with a capacity of approximately 118 billion cubic feet and significant injection and withdrawal capacity.

We have set up and trained over 150 users in 4 different domestic locations. Originators and traders now can easily log phone calls and meetings with customers as well as store deal documentation, deal pipeline and sales stage information.

Episode II will launch end of June and will include synchronization capabilities and well as other customized fields for EIM business. Siebel Sales Enterprise is a customer-focused centralized database, which enables sharing of all information learned about our customers.  Siebel is designed to help in-house and mobile sales professionals to manage accounts, contacts, activities and opportunities associated with the sales cycle.



IN THE NEWS

Enron Tops Gas Market: Higher commodity prices and greater demand have generated record earnings for many gas marketers during the past quarter, making energy one of the few sectors gaining ground in the U.S. economy. Leading the pack is Enron whose gas volumes grew 30 percent, with 27.2 billion cfd traded on average by March 31. Much of Enron's success is attributed to EnronOnline, which saw 275,000 transactions with a total value of $162 billion in various commodities in the first quarter. The second place earner, El Paso, earned half of Enron's total with only 13.8 billion traded in 2001.

and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

Subject:	Housing Starts

Hi Andrea!

What we have found is the following:

Housing starts by state does not exist from a U.S. Government statistical source however we have been able to find a monthly data source that maybe useful and correlate with housing starts. The U.S. census presently provides building permits on a monthly basis from 1995 to April 2001. The website gets updated on the 20th of each month (i.e. May's statistics will come out on June 20th).  This data is available by state and metropolitan areas (MSA) (e.g. cities and counties). Before January 1995 they have only annual data on a state by state and on a city-by-city basis which starts in 1980 . This website has the monthly data divided up into the actual number of permits given that month and another chart that has year to date permits from the beginning of the year.    
http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/const/www/permitsindex.html

By Metropolitan Area

http://www.census.gov/const/www/C40/table3.html

By State:

http://www.census.gov/const/www/C40/table2.html

Although the U.S. Government does not have a statistical source for Housing Starts, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) does provide the information. 
Please note that the NAHB website only displays regional breakdown of housing starts by region.  We called the National Association of Home Builders and they informed us that they do have annual data by state and it is published twice a year for a nominal charge of $250.00.  The person we contacted at the NAHB is Dean Christ at (202) 822-0478.

Subject:	Energy Executive Committee

Vince,

	As you have seen in the write-ups I have been sending you, we have
established the Energy Markets Institute here to provide a world class
recruitment, specialized training, and research resource for the energy
industry.  The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as
possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up
an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable
resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global
Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth
(Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly
(Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on
the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired,
Shell Oil).

	Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a
leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the
industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would
be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to
organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it
may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7
p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you
would agree to be on the Committee.

	We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance
for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).  I also want to discuss any
suggestion you may have on people we should be trying to recruit for this.

Best wishes,

Praveen

ABSTRACT:

  SUBJECT AREAS: Risk management, financial innovation, options
  and derivatives.
  CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S.


  In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific
  Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather
  derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of
  megawatt hours (MWh) sold.

  The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of
  how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not
  want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether
  to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or
  derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may
  be used as an introduction to options.

  The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and
  deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW.
  Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability
  distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability
  distribution for the net operating contribution including the
  contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives.
  It is instructive for the students to think about what would be
  the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent.
  This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio.

  Specific learning objectives of these cases include these:

  - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial
    innovation

  - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk

  - to challenge the students to value options where the
    Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be
    readily employed

  - to experience the perspective of top management in risk
    management activities.

"RE: Cover Letter and Resume","Billy,

We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.

He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked 
a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not
define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area.
When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would
complain that the question is too detailed.


He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).

Research Group-

I just wanted to take this opportunity to tell each of you ""thanks"" for a wonderful ride.  It has been such a pleasure getting to know you, and working with you.  I do not think that I have ever been exposed to such a talented and extraordinary group of individuals.  I am sorry that I have not been around these past two weeks- I have been running wild though.  If I can ever do anything for any of you, please feel free to email me at alabbe4@yahoo.com.

Best Wishes for your continued success. . . I know that you will not have any problems though because all of you are ""Super Stars""!!

Thanks again,
Anne

"RE: SMS conference","Ian,

My secretary contacted SMS. I was surprised that they want to charge 
me for the conference. Typically, the speakers are invited to attend without incurring
the cost of a conference. The is the first invitation to speak I received, combined with a request to pay for
the privilege.

Three approaches are proposed:
1. Maximizing profit.
2. Minimizing variance.
3. Minimizing value at risk (in progress, but not very promising).

Subject:	RE: Reference request regarding Eric W Cope S05371/R966

Vince,

Please find below some text for Eric's letter.  I hope it is helpful for your development of the letter.  If you have questions or would like some other information, please let me know.  Also, on the question of Enron letterhead, I suppose the desired form of submission is via the web site.  Unless you have electronic letterhead, the issue may be moot.

Martin

Eric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of 2001.  During this time, Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills.  In all cases, he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand.  While some direction was given in each case, Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently, and he executed the tasks very effectively.

One major project for the summer was to develop a web-browser-based trading simulation platform (TSP).  The TSP would create user accounts, require user logons, post simulated market information, post simulated commidity prices, accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users, and track user account information such as positions, order history, and buying power.  The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent.  Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices, ficticious calculated prices, or bid/offer prices based on some update algorithms.  The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies.

Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure.  In short order, a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin ""trading"" commodities.  The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin, however, the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible.

Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues, advertising media placement prices, and long-distance voice telephony prices.  In many of the cases, data were scarce, as were definitive instructions.  Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach, always in consultation and discussion with others, but never with ""hand-holding"" or intense oversight.  His co-workers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Eric's ability to take general direction and achieve productive results.  Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure, such as we had.

Dear Colleague:

Eric W Cope has submitted an application to AT&T Labs,
with a request that we seek a reference letter from you in support of this application.
We thank you in advance for providing this letter.  The reference letters are
a very important part of our evaluation process, but we also recognize that
they call for a significant measure of time and attention on your part.
In this message, we first describe below the three options for submittal
of the letter, and then, in the final paragraphs, you will find some
comments about the nature of the job applied for.

We know your time is precious, so we have tried to make the
process as efficient as possible.  If you have access to a browser
from your mailer, then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below:

  http://www.research.att.com/~kbl/cgi-bin/resumedocs/S05371/R966

Via this web page, you can submit text, html, postscript, or pdf files.
Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you, and ONLY for
this particular student.  It is linked directly to the student's resume,
and the processing occurs automatically and immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If it is inconvenient to use the URL, you may email your letter by replying
to this email, but please help us out, if you use this option, by sending
the letter as plain text only, not as a word processor file, without indent, and
not as an attachment.  Also please make sure that your mailer includes
the entire subject line in your reply message.
If you use this option, please note that the processing of your letter
will occur manually, and therefore may entail a considerable delay.

Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display, unless
you ask that it be treated as fixed-format.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As a third option, if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy.  Please
note that we discourage this approach, since electronic letters can be
distributed far more effectively to the hiring managers.  However, if you
wish, please see http://www.research.att.com/academic/Addresses.html
for information on the proper address to use for various purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, a word about the position for which the student has applied:

This student has applied for a summer internship.
We hire summer interns roughly from the third year of undergraduate
work through graduate school.  The summer projects vary in level,
depending on the student involved.  The students normally work in
a one-on-one fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the
ongoing research work in the lab, but they are expected to function
somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization
with the work.  Accordingly, we are interested in information you
may have as to the student's adaptability, ability to learn new
material, and to work effectively with minimal supervision.


Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Ken Lyons,
AT&T Labs Web Resume Database

   Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press. Hopefully,
   this
   has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.  The
   title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting notices.
   If
   you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this toward
   the
   attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have something
   to
   provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
   appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is
   needed
   as soon as possible. Please advise.
   Thank you.

      November 15 presentation is still on my calendar. I shall be leaving
      later
      that
      day for our annual  management conference in San Antonio (around 3:30
      p.m.).
      My recollection is that the presentation is from11:30 till 1:00 so I
      should
      have plenty of time to get to the airport.

      Please, feel free to invite guests from other industries. I shall
   send
      you
      the title of the presentation  from home tomorrow morning.

      Shirley Crenshaw, my assistant, will send you my bio.

Subject:	Boltzmann Model Demonstration from Toshiba in Tokyo
Importance:	High

Vince,

Enron Japan received a presentation today from a nuclear physicist working for Toshiba who has developed an application of the Boltzmann model to finance.  We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Group's Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html

Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.

Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them. 

Regards,
Mark Brady

Vince,


Two recruiting seminars this week for the Finance Department that may be of
interest to you.

(1)Thursday, November 29:  Evgenia Portniaguina (University of Utah). She is
completing here Ph.D., and is one of their strongest students ever. She is
originally from Russia with a BS in Exploration Geophysics (4.0 GPA), Oil &
Gas Academy, Russia.  She will now speak on a Finanicial Market
MicroStructure topic, but she could be of great interest from the Energy
Institute point of view.  Her seminar is in Room 256, Melcher Hall,
10:30 -12 noon.

(2) Friday, November 30:  Peter Carr, Adjunct Professor at Courant
Institute, NYU...His specialization is in derivatives (although he will talk
on ""Hedging with Incomplete Markets""). His talk is also in Room 256, 1:30-3
p.m.

I am forwarding you the resume of Marilyn Mielke. She is a very highly
educated and accomplished person. She has a background in science but 
no skills required in my group. I was impressed with her excellent
communication and social skills - maybe she can help in your area.

She was knocking on the Enron's door for a long time.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you so very much for your time on Wednesday. It has been
challenging to find out, from the outside, exactly what your group does
on a daily basis and what type of people make up your team. I do not
feel that there is any substitute for the information, and feel, that
one can get directly from the source itself, thank you for making your
team available to meet with me as well.

You mentioned that the Associate Program at Enron could be a great
starting point for me to acquire the business skills and experience that
I seek. I would be a most enthusiastic candidate as I have looked into
the program, and I too, feel that it would be an exciting and logical
starting point for me.

It is my understanding that in order for me to enter the program I would
require sponsorship. Would you be able to sponsor me for this program?
If so, I have attached my cv (as a Word '97 document) and understand
that the person to be contacted with a nomination would be Mr Jeff Davis
in Human Resources. Please let me know if there is anything further that
I can do to realize my goal of working within Enron while gaining
business skills and experience.
It was a pleasure speaking with you.

Thank you again for your help and encouragement.

Sincerely,
Dr. Marilyn Mielke

Something to brighten your day!  And remember to keep in touch!


******************************************************************************************

Jake, the rancher, went one day to fix a distant fence.
The wind was cold and gusty and the clouds rolled, gray and dense.

As he pounded the last staples in and gathered tools to go,
The temperature had fallen and the snow began to blow.

When he finally reached his pickup, he felt a heavy heart,
From the sound of that ignition, he knew it wouldn't start.

So Jake did what most of us would do, if we'd have been there.
He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer.

As he turned the key for the last time, he softly cursed his luck.
They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck.

Now Jake had been around in life, and done his share of roamin'.
But when he saw Heaven, he was shocked - it looked just like Wyomin'.

Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter.
[Now, this line, it ain't needed but it helps with rhyme and meter.]

So they set and talked a spell or two, or maybe it was three,
Nobody was keeping' score--- in Heaven time is free.

""I've always heard,"" Jake said to Pete, ""that God will answer prayer,
But one time I asked for help, and, well He just plain wasn't there.

Does God answer prayers of some, and ignores the prayers of others?
That don't seem exactly square - I know all men are brothers.

Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason?
Maybe, it's the time of day, the weather or the season.

Now I just ain't trying to act smart, it's just the way I feel,
And I was wonderin', could you tell me - what the heck's the deal?""

Peter listened very patiently and when Jake was done,
There were smiles of recognition, and he said, ""So, you're the one!

That day your truck wouldn't start, and you sent your prayer a flyin',
You gave us all a real bad time, with hundreds of us a tryin',

A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file,
But you know, Jake - - - we hadn't heard from you in quite a while.

And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota,
He didn't recognize your voice... and started a truck in South Dakota.

So, remember to keep in touch!

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Freight Markets
Enron Freight Markets (EFM) launched its over-the-road trucking business this week.  In addition, EFM completed 199 intermodal transactions in the first week of April.

ENA West Power
ENA West Power recently closed the sale of two power projects.  The 750MW Pastoria Energy Facility in Kern County, California was sold to Calpine and the 240MW Fountain Valley Power project in Colorado was sold to Black Hills Energy Capital.  Given the power shortage in the West, ENA is developing additional power generation in Nevada, California and Washington.

Enron Industrial Markets
The newsprint group of EIM is working to revolutionize the newsprint market and bring financial rigor and market efficiencies to a business that has remained relatively unchanged for more than a century. The global newsprint market is a 23 billion dollar a year business with the North American market comprising one third.  The group's originators, mid-marketers, and financial and physical traders offer our customers numerous financial and physical products not previously available in the market. 

EIM has made a substantial commitment to this business with the purchase of Garden State Paper company last year and the recent purchase of Daishowa Paper in Quebec City. The number of transactions has grown exponentially with the physical trading alone reaching a nominal trading volume of more than $10,000,000 per month in little more than four months since opening.  In addition to physical spot transactions, the desk offers our counterparties log-term fixed priced transactions, indexed based pricing, forward contracts, swaps, and derivative products.

Forest Products
Forestweb Inc., an Internet-based generator, aggregator and integrator of knowledge and information for the forest products industry, announced a new window to industry financial and risk management tools available from Clickpaper.com. Clickpaper allows the industry direct access to transactable prices for both physical and financial products, in an electronic format.

Paperloop.com, one of the leading online resources for the forest products industry, announced the addition of Clickpaper.com in their emarketplace, which showcases various e-commerce companies and highlights their services. Paperloop provides Clickpaper.com exposure to its 250,000+ monthly users in the pulp, paper and converting industries. 


IN THE NEWS

Ken Lay was the cover story for the April 2001 issue of Continental Magazine.  He had positive things to say about his employees.

""Sitting in his 50th floor mahogany-paneled office overlooking his much-beloved downtown Houston, Lay, with a self-conscious smile, bows his head slightly as he's described as an innovative market maker.  'I really can't take any credit, he says. My employees are responsible for what Enron does.'  What he does best, the Missouri-born corporate icon says, is 'to create an atmosphere of empowerment and creativity and hire bright, innovative people who aren't afraid to take risks and try new things.""

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Poland obtains Gas Trading License
On 22nd March 2001 Enron Poland received a 10-year Gas Trading License, valid for both domestic gas trading within Poland as well as for gas exports.  The license is a key component to our entering the gas trading market in Poland and, coupled with the Power Trading License we obtained in 1999, will give Enron Poland a strong position in the developing wholesale energy market.  In the next two to three weeks, we expect to receive a cross-border trading license covering gas imports that are further regulated under the Polish Energy Law Ordinance on Gas Import Diversification.

Enron Wind announces first UK off-shore wind farm
On 5th April 2001, Enron Wind announced that it had been granted the right to initiate the planning process for its first UK offshore wind farm, located at Gunfleet Sands, 7km from Clacton-upon-Sea in Essex.  Construction is expected to start towards the end of 2002, with the wind farm of 30 turbines being operational by Q4 2003.  Enron Wind is also actively involved in a number of on-shore projects in the UK, including the development of wind farms in Wales and Northern Ireland.

Subject: Revised version of the VAR paper


All,
You will find attached the revised paper.  Most of the changes are cosmetic / editorial in nature except for the following (Tanya please check) material changes:
 
1. The CPU time for SORM grows with n + n*n/2 and not with n**3.  
 
2.  I rewrote Appendix I -- corrected  two equations to make the calculated Hermite coefficients and the expression for the binnormal density function consistent with the definition of the Hermite polynomials used in this work, which have variances equal to n! for the nth order polynomial.  
Also I changed many symbols in Appendix I to harmonize and especially to avoid using alpha and beta which have special meanings in FORM/SORM literature
I will post the version in the O drive tomorrow.
 
Regards,
Rabi De

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Subject:	Meeting with Gordon on Raptor



I have talked with Gordon regarding to the impact of current Enron stock price on the Raptor structure.  Here are the main points:

1) After the March  fix-up, Raptor hedged ENE credit capacity all the way down to ENE $20/share.  And the collars are consists of European type options.  The maturities are:  original collars for Raptor I, II, IV will mature in 2003.  The new collars for Raptor II and IV will mature in 2005.  

2) The collars were transacted with ENE.

3) The option settling method will be equity method.  Enron will hand over shares at the maturity.  But there is a maximum 3 share per option limit.   For example:   With a strike of $80,  if ENE price drop down to $20, the intrinsic value of the option is $60 which means ENE will have to hand over $60/$20=3 shares.   But if ENE price drop down to $10, ENE still only hand over 3 shares, with $30 in value.

4) When options exercised, Enron will have share dilution but no impact on Enron income.

5) A good portion of the public equities have been liquidated by Raptor at a substantial discount. (I have the list and the share numbers) The notional value of all the swapped assets at the time of Raptor inception was $733.68 MM.  Current value of assets remain in Raptors are $141.8 MM.

6) While the raptors have hedged Enron's credit capacities,  the current Enron credit capacity dropped from around ($36MM) after the fix up, to around ($237MM) as of 8/20/01.

Hope these information help answering some of the question you had.

Ding.

Vince,

I am just trying to make sure that all of the data is clean for your PRC meeting on Wednesday, and noticed that although Shane Green and Chris Pernoud are both specialist, Shane is Commercial Support (CS) and Chris is Specialized Technical (ST).  Please let me know if this is correct or if they should both either be ST or CS.  I am assuming that they should both be CS since the Sr. Specialist are all ST.  Additionally, I just wanted to let you know that the following people will not be rated during the meeting because their hire date was after December 31, 2000:
Anguel Grigorov
Wichai Narongwanich
Chris Pernoud
Leann Walton

Finally, please verify that you do want to do rank the assistants tomorrow.  As you know, ranking the assistants is not required, but is a business unit leader decision.

Hi Vince,

I hope all is well with you!

As for my coordinates.....I am trading (position trading--
futures)....primarily soybeans, 30-year bonds, swiss franc,
and British Pound......I observe the charts after the markets close...put in
my orders accordingly .....and sit and wait for
confirmation and/or for stop orders to be elected....:)...I continue
watching the gold charts.....eventually, that market will
wake up again!   Vince, I am curious of your fundamental analysis of the
currency, and/or equity markets...

Since most of my chart analysis is performed after the markets close....I
have extra time to explore other business opportunities.....at this time, I
am working on a initiative, to import nurses from India to the U.S.!  A
friend of mine, from New Delhi, has asked that I work with her on this
project.  She is talking w/Duke University, as well as the University of
North Carolina Nursing School to collaborate w/her, in India, and provide
their curriculum in India....We are talking to hospitals throughout the
U.S., and are finding an interest in Indian recruits.  Of the foreign nurses
now entering the U.S., the majority are Filipinos.  Did you know about the
shortage of nurses here in the U.S.?

Hello to Mike.....and also....How is Maureen?

Keep in touch......Anytime, you stop in Chicago, call me...312-643-1910....I
live very close to the Enron office on Michigan Avenue..

Take care,
Tricia

Subject:	Question about possible job openings

Vince,

Steve Leppard suggested that I contact you about the possibility of a position in Houston. I worked as an analyst under Steve in London's Metal Analytics group. I was planning on returning to the States before they announced the redundancies in Europe, and the redundancy program made a move back to Houston all the more appealing. I am a first-year analyst with a statistics background, and I would be very interested in working for Enron in Houston. 

Steve has told me that he would be happy to give me a recommendation. If you know of a position which might be suitable, I would be very happy to speak to you at your convenience.

Thank you in advance for your consideration. 

Ted Barlow

Dear Vince
I know that you are always looking for good  prospective hires so I am bringing this to your attention. Armando Ugarte who is  a former Ph.D. student of mine is currently working for i2 in Texas but told me  recently that he is considering a career move. Armando has a very interesting  background combining excellent training in economics and operations research  with extensive practical experience in IT working as software architect and  application developer for HP, Oracle and i2. I know Armando for over 14 years  since his undergraduate studies in our department and was always fascinated by  his broad spectrum of talents and experience. I am enclosing his resume. I do  not exactly know what his immediate plans are and if he has already another job  lined up. He told me ,however , that he would like to make better use of his  education. He took the job at i2 after deciding, for personal reasons, to  repatriate from Colombia where he held a faculty position. I highly recommend  him as a hard worker, solid and mature researcher and a very likable person. If  you are interested you should contact him directly. His contact info is on his  resume.

Ms. Fraser -

Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Harry Baumes and I head the
Agriculture Services area at DRI-WEFA. I have been working with Peter McNabb
regarding ENRON's interest in our agriculture and fertilizer capabilities.
He has asked me to forward samples of some of our short-term oriented
agriculture publications to you.

Peter has forwarded material to you and your colleagues already. The
materials attached are in PDF format. These products include:

US Agriculture Executive Summary
Corn Commodity Update
Cotton Commodity Update
Rice Commodity Update
Soybean Commodity Update
Wheat Commodity Update
Fertilizer Market Assessment

In addition I am also including a recent ""Agriculture Commentary"". This is a
product that we release on an as needed basis. When there is a major USDA
publication release or a major event that impacts agricultural markets, we
typically release an assessment of the event or publication. For example, on
March 30, the USDa released it Planting Perspective report, we provided our
clients with an Commentary. The outbreak of Foot & Mouth Disease in the UK
earlier this year was an event that led us to release a Commentary. The
Commentary is DRI-WEFA's quick response newsworth items.

Also, to help support clients. We make available to our clients, Planting
and and Harvest Progress Reports. this information is available to
individuals and/or organizations through USDA. The value DRI-WEFA provides
is that we include graphics that enable a comparison of the current year's
progress with the 10 year average and the PROGRESS high and low over the
past 10 years. This detail is available at the national and for each
reporting state.

If you have any questions after reviewing the attached material, please feel
free to contact either Peter or me.

I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and your colleagues at
ENRON.

Have a  nice weekend.

"RE: Candidate for Evaluation","Gary,

He looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive
hundreds of such resumes. The way to
distinguish between different candidates is to ask
the question: Did an individual make an effort
and invested his time to learn things directly  useful
to Enron?

Given our work load, I would not accept a person
who has general quantitative skills but expects that
Enron will train him from ground zero in all other
disciplines. We had recently a candidate who wrote a letter
and complained about being asked questions about
energy economics, finance, etc. during an interview.

We can interview the candidate over the phone and see if he knows anything
beyond math.

Thank you for the referral.  Obviously, this individual is very intelligent and highly skilled - but I do not see a fit for th e analyst/associate program.  

I will have my group send a letter to him indicating our decision not to bring him in for interviews for the pool.  

I did have one suggestion for you though.  You may want to pass his resume by Vince Kaminski for his review.  Vince has specialized needs and this candidate may be better suited for his group.

I met with Niki last week in which we had a general interview on his interests.  He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.  Somewhat of a unique combination.  He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments.  In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group.

I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.  Pls let me know if you are able to make contact and see a possibility for him at Enron.

thanks.

Hi Vince,
Just a note to say I hope that you and the other good people I have met over the past couple of years are able to overcome the difficulties you are currently facing at Enron.  As you know we are continuing to market our GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System to the industry and have done pretty well in that effort.  In fact, we are doing well enough that our users are in need of good analysts who could quickly learn our system and operate it for their companies.  There are three or four openings in Houstonand several others in other cities in the U.S.  If you can think of anyone who has worked for you who would be both capable and interested in this kind of application, I would be happy to forward their names and information to the people who are looking.
Again, good luck in whatever you choose to do, please stay in touch, and thanks for your help.

Vince,

I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating
in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in
quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is
deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward
to your visit.

On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on
our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership
(http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation
from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in
expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!

The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York.
Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enron's participation
on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program
to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a ""first
look"" at the ""MSCF Resume Book.""  From our standpoint, your experience and
counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and
opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.

Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan.
Would you be willing join us?

Subject:	Research Group Teamwork

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to ""people"" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.   
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.  
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully, 
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,

Subject:	FW: ""Convolution VAR""

Vince, I contacted Albanese and you can see here the reply I got from him.

The experiment I could suggest to test the ""Convolution VAR"" for non-normal variables 
would be: to generate prices with non-normal log returns and compare VAR based on simulations
versus ""convolution VAR"" for chosen non-normal distributions.

The spreadsheet Dr.Albanese attached compares different techniques (Monte-Carlo, Historical, Convolution)
on real data. The results are different. It is hard to come up to any conclusion after such experiment.

Hello Tanya,

our method is meant to be used for non-normal distributions. The assumption
of independence works out very nicely in my experience. The key point is
that the kind of principal component analysis we developed is portfolio
dependent, so we rank directions in risk factor space according to their
impact to portfolio returns. The agreement with empirical VaR or backtesting
performance is excellent. I am attaching a test Excel spreadsheet for our
VaR software library, which includes our fast convolution method together
with a variety of variance-reduced Montecarlo implementation.

If I can be of further help, don't hesitate to contact me.

best regards, Claudio

"" GM  vs. Microsoft ""

Thanks to - M A B

Subject: Bill Gates

Recently, Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the
auto industry and stated ""If GM had kept up with the technology like the
computer industry has, we would all be driving $25 cars that got 1,000 
miles to the gallon.""

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release
stating: ""If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be
driving cars with the following characteristics:

l. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.

2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to
buy a new car.

3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You
would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows,
shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. 
For some reason you would simply accept this.

4. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,
five times as fast and twice as easy to drive- but would run on only
five percent of the roads.

5. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all
be replaced by a single ""General Protection Fault"" warning light.

6. The airbag system would ask ""are you sure"" before deploying.

7. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out
and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle,
turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.

8. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to
drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the
same manner as the old car.

9. You'd have to press the ""Start"" button to turn the engine off.

A trough is in the air for the West. Plenty of heat and humidity is in the air for the East.***  The tropical wave in the Caribbean near Hispaniola does not look as organized as it did yesterday. This will result in a delay of naming it a storm with the distinct possibility it never develops. Most of the models do bring a system into the Southern Gulf by Thursday, but interaction with Cuba tomorrow may keep it very weak. Steering currents favor this moving towards Mexico by Sunday. The rest of the tropics remain eerily quiet.  There is plenty of weather news for the continental U.S. in the short term and it centers around the Plains heat ridge. It is flexing NE once again with the rest of this week looking quite hot from the Plains to the Ohio Valley. La! te in the week, the Great Lakes and NE get in on this for a day or two, but there is still a weakening Canadian influence on those areas. Another front should drop from the Lakes towards the Mid-Atlantic Thursday and Friday. The NW flow does not look particularly impressive, so the cooling looks moderate at best. We still look to be absent of widespread 100 degree heat outside the Plains, but plenty of 90's and humidity will bring 100+ afternoon heat indices. There is still very little of note going on in the Western U.S. The hydro situation in the NW remains, but temperatures in most of the region are at or slightly below seasonal norms.

The early stages of my predicted warmer than normal August appear to be setting up as planned. What seems to be in disagreement is where the hottest air sets up. It has been the Plains primarily this summer. The most recent runs of the European and Navy models suggest that the hottest air especially relative to normal shifts to the Lakes and NE as a monster of a ridge forms in the area. The Canadian and MRF models look more like a flat broad ridge East of the Rockies which keeps the heat core West of the Mississippi. If any of these verify close to reality, most all of the Eastern 3/4 of the country will be above normal anyway, but I like the large ridge idea, the European seems overdone. The pattern continues to be favorable for t! ropical activity, but something out in the tropics has to get cranked up first. The last couple of years, most tropical activity has been recurved NE away from the U.S. due to a trough in the Atlantic. It currently is no where to be found, but at the moment, neither is the tropical activity.  Day 6: Sunday, August  5, 2001   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

"FW: Jeff McMahon Named CFO","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Ken Lay- Chairman of the Board@ENRON
Sent:	Wednesday, October 24, 2001 3:50 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Re: Gwen Koepke","Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince

Vince,

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your expectations during PRC.

Thanks,
Anne

Dear Vince,

	I hope that you would have received by now (through e-mail) the
invitation from the Dean for the Energy Committee and the Advisory Board,
the complete business plan for the Institute, and the list of the energy
committee members. We are very excited to have you on board with us.
	Since you will not be able to attend the first meeting, I would like

> > > > >
We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using
your name, address, SSN#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (author of this
piece) have firsthand knowledge, because my wallet was stolen last month and

within a week the thieve(s) ordered an expensive monthly cell phone package,

applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line
approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to change

my driving record information online, and more.
> > > > >
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case
this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers
and your card numbers handy so you know who to call. Keep
those where you can find them easily (having to hunt for them is additional
stress you WON'T need at that point!).
> > >
File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was
stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a
first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).
> > > > >
But here's what is perhaps most important: I never ever thought to
do this. Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SSN#. I had never heard
of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen
and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit.
> > > > >
By the time I was advised to do this - almost 2 weeks after the
theft all the damage had been done (there are records of all the credit
checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about
before placing the alert). Since then, no additional damage has been done,
and the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It

seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax 1-800 525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW) 1-800-301-7195
Trans Union 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration also has a fraud line 1-800-269-0271

We pass along jokes, we pass along just about everything... do think
about passing this information along... it could help someone else

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 
DPC lenders' Singapore meet inconclusive
 
THE CRUCIAL talks between the foreign and Indian lenders of US energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company at Singapore remained inconclusive on Tuesday and are slated to continue on Wednesday. ""The meeting has spilled over to the second day with DPC to participate in the proceedings on Wednesday,"" financial institutions sources said. The sources said Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor were likely to participate in the second day of the meeting. They said the meeting, which went on for over an hour, discussed the ongoing financial and legal disputes between DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. ""Nothing has been finalised as yet,"" they said when asked whether both the Indian and foreign lenders were able to arrive at any solution for solving the current status quo. At the Singapore meet, the lenders have come together to try and diffuse the tension and unite the two ""warring partners"" - DPC and MSEB. 

The foreign lenders were expected to be updated by their Indian counterparts about developments like DPC's preliminary termination notice to MSEB, which in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing power from the multinational from May 29. The Indian lenders would press for completion of the $3-billion project, as DPC has stopped commercial production and doubts are being expressed for commissioning of its 1,444-mw phase-II, due on Thursday. The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India executive director R S Agarwal, who is also DPC board member, along with representatives of State Bank of India and ICICI. The foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim Bank and Opic. (PTI)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE TIMES OF INDIA, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 
Lenders split over DPC transfer notice to MSEB ,  Pradipta Bagchi 
Lenders to the $ 2.9-billion Dabhol Power Company are split over whether DPC should be allowed to issue a transfer notice to MSEB. Last Friday, Enron sought the lenders' permission--for the second time in a month--to issue a transfer notice to MSEB. A transfer notice allows the valuation of all fixed assets to begin with and is the first step in starting the process of transfer of assets to the MSEB. While domestic lenders like IDBI, ICICI and SBI--with an exposure of more than Rs 5,000 crore to the project--are opposing the move to issue a transfer notice, most foreign lenders including the lead arrangers to the project are now agreeable to the transfer notice being issued by the DPC. On the first day of lenders' deliberations in Singapore, vast differences emerged between the domestic and foreign lenders in this regard. 
While domestic lenders are worried about the impact of the huge exposure on their balance sheets, foreign lenders, who typically have smaller exposure, are of the opinion that without any alternative concrete solutions, it may be worthwhile to pull the plug on the project. ``Without any concrete solutions and no fixed time-frame, foreign lenders are not willing to go to their respective credit committees for further disbursals,'' a lender from Singapore told The Times of India. ``There is no point throwing more good money after bad, is the consensus among foreign lenders,'' said the lender. 
Among other issues discussed on the first day of the meetings was whether the lenders should throw Enron out of the project and take over the operations of DPC. However, without a proper team of skilled managers in place, it is unlikely that the lenders will risk throwing out the current operators. Fresh disbursals from the lenders are unlikely. Among the first casualties will be an Enron affiliate company, which is the EPC contractor for the LNG terminal. On June 8, a payment of $ 13 million is to be made to the LNG contractor, which will not be disbursed by the lenders. Another big payment of $ 25 million has to be made to Bechtel, the EPC contractor for the power plant, by June 18 as well. 
Enron and DPC officials will make a presentation on Wednesday to the bankers, following which, further deliberations will be held among the lending banks.

THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 
DPC lenders meet opens on a positive note

The first day of the crucial meeting between the Indian and international lenders in Singapore has opened on a positive note with the foreign lenders showing signs of giving more time to Indian government to resolve the problem. 

Foreign lenders are enthused by the fact that the Centre is ready to give incentives to the project so that DPC can reduce its tariff. The Centre' package include cutting interest rate on the project, and asking the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to work out a contingency plan for sale of power to other States from the Dabhol power project.''The international lenders are ready to give some more time to find out a solution. Lenders will take the maximum hit if the Enron pulls the plug into the project,'' FI sources said. Hence, the rethinking among the international lenders. The Centre's package, to be ready in another two months, would also lower the customs duty on imported LNG which would further help the company to lower the tariff.

Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting on Wednesday to present their side of the story. Tuesday's meeting, which went on for over an hour, discussed the on-going financial and legal disputes between DPC and its partner Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).At the meet, the lenders have come together to try and diffuse escalated tension and unite the two warring partners, DPC and MSEB, say FI sources. 

While loans from international FIs enjoy the Indian government guarantee, it would be Indian FIs which will have to take the maximum hit if the project gets derailed. On Tuesday, the foreign lenders were updated by the Indian counterparts over series of events like DPC's Preliminary Termination Notice to MSEB, which in retaliation rescinded the PPA and stopped drawing power from the multinational from May 29. The Indian team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) executive director R S Agarwal, who is also DPC board member, along with representatives of State Bank of India and ICICI. The foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim bank and OPIC.

 The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess the viability of despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit states across the country, announced the Union minister of state for power Jayavantiben on Tuesday. Mehta said that the CEA, which has been asked to undertake this exercise recently, will take into account the burden to be borne by various power deficit states during the despatch of power. Currently, if the power has to be transported from eastern grid to western grid, there is certain fixed charge imposed on it. ""The CEA will have to carry out this exercise at length so that the exact picture will emerge whether or not the Dabhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase that power,"" the minister added. Mehta said that the centre will not purchase Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take the additional burden on them. She informed that the union finance ministry in no uncertain terms made it clear that the centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheaper rate to the states especially when these states owe over Rs 30,000 crore to various central public sector undertakings. Mehta said that prime minister AB Vajpayee who has been apprised him of the present situation on the Dabhol front has assured to provide necessary assistance especially technical one to resolve the issue.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001
DPC lenders to resume talks today in Singapore 

 THE two-day talks to resolve Dabhol tangle opened on a positive note in Singapore on Tuesday.Sources in Indian financial institutions (IFIs) told The Financial Express that the IFIs comprising representatives of IDBI, ICICI, State Bank of India (SBI) met to chalk out their strategy at the two-day meeting with offshore lenders and Enron officials. The Indian team was lead by Mr RS Agarwal, IDBI executive director, along with the other officials from other lending institutions including those from the SBI and ICICI.Apparently, the IFIs, on Tuesday revived their efforts to convince DPC's offshore lenders to maintain ""restraint"" to save the Dabhol project. The meeting between the IFIs and their foreign counterparts remained inconclussive on Tuesday. The foreign lenders are expected to take a clear stand on Wednesday.

Interestingly, the meeting is expected to be participated by members of the DPC on the second day, said financial institutions sources. The sources said, Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president Neil McGregor are likely to participate in the second day of the meeting. The meeting was also attended by a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan Exim Bank and OPIC. According to sources in IDBI: ""The foreign lenders have given us a patient hearing to our views suggesting that they should not precipitate the crisis by any of their further moves."" The sources said the IFIs are determined to take up the issue of completion of the Dabhol phase-II in view of 90 per cent of its completion. ""The IDBI has recieved a mandate from the government that an all-out effort be made to save the Dabhol project,"" the sources added.

The offshore lenders are believed to have sought various details with reference to the payment guarantees from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) as well as fulfilment of contractual obligations in the wake of revoking of the power purchase agreement. The IFIs are likely to press for the revocation of suspension of loan disbursement by offshore lenders so that phase-II be completed. The offshore lenders had suspended loan disbursement after the DPC board meeting of London on April 25.

BUSINESS STANDARD, Wednesday, June 06, 2001
MSEB refuses DPC power at 90% PLF, Renni Abraham
 The Maharashtra government will not buy power from the first phase of the Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) project at a 90 per cent plant load factor (PLF), a senior state government official said here today. The statement represents a hardening of Maharashtra's position on talks with DPC and virtually kills the latter's proposal to split tariffs for the Centre and Maharashtra. The Maharashtra State Electri- city Board (MSEB) is now required to buy 90 per cent of the power generated by the first phase (740 mw) of the project. But during negotiations with the Godbole Committee, it has been demanding that the requirement be cut to 35 per cent. At the last Godbole Committee meeting, DPC had put forward a plan to split tariffs for the Centre and Maharashtra, with the Centre paying Rs 3.30 per unit of power and MSEB paying Rs 3.50. 
The Centre, DPC suggested, could buy two-thirds of the power it generated, once the second phase (1,444 mw, taking the total capacity to 2,184 mw) was completed. Maharashtra's latest position undermines DPC's proposal since the Enron-promoted company's tariff hinges on MSEB absorbing 90 per cent of the power it generates in the first phase. A senior state government official said: ""The Centre has been talking a lot about playing the role of a facilitator. What we need is a buyer for the second phase."" Despite recent central government pronouncements, state government officials privately argue that the Centre is not playing an active role in resolving the problems that have plagued the DPC project. At the very first Godbole Committee meeting he attended, the Centre's nominee, AV Gokak, adopted a non-committal stand. The Maharashtra government official added: ""Gokak said he was merely attending the meeting in the capacity of a messenger and would communicate to the Centre any solution worked out by the renegotiation committee.

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 
Dabhol says ready to extend conciliation , Shaji Vikraman , Balaji C. Mouli 

THE Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has accepted the Finance Ministry's proposal for a two months' extension for the conciliation process. The extension will be effective from June 7. This development is perceived by the Government as a positive signal as it offers more leeway to work out a solution to resolve the Dabhol crisis. DPC's nod for an extension, which was communicated to the Finance Secretary on Monday, is subject to the Government acceding to the company's stand on the ongoing arbitration proceedings. The company has said that it would continue to pursue the arbitration proceedings which have already been initiated by the company, according to senior Ministry officials. Under the power purchase agreement (PPA), conciliation and arbitration are two methods under the contract to resolve disputes between the two parties. Normally, arbitration is resorted to only after conciliation fails. However, in this case, DPC has dragged MSEB to the arbitration forum even as the conciliation process is being pursued. 

DPC has already slapped three arbitration notices on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The first notice was issued to the board for its failure to honour the December 2000 bill of Rs 102 crore and the January 2001 bill of Rs 111.6 crore while two other notices were for failures to honour the Maharashtra Government's State support agreement and the supplementary State support agreement. The conciliation process was adopted in the wake of the dispute arising over the settlement of DPC's December bills of Rs 102 crore, followed by the MSEB's counter claim of Rs 400 crore for the same period. 

The conciliation process was agreed upon on April 7 and was to be concluded in two months. However, simultaneously, arbitration proceedings were triggered between DPC and MSEB. With the conciliation process making little headway, the Finance Ministry sought an additional two months time for concluding the process. Prior to that, the Attorney General's interpretation of the MSEB-DPC contract was that the payment could be made to DPC only if the bill was undisputed. Hence, the Centre decided to opt for the conciliation process. 

During recent meetings between the Government and the DPC officials, the latter had pointed out that if the Government was able to work out a package in six months, it would withdraw its termination notice and reamin in the project for up to a year. The Finance Ministry officials feel that the Centre has been dragged into the DPC controversy well beyond its contractual obligation. ``The Centre's involvement in DPC-MSEB issue is restricted to the first phase. The fate of the second phase is entirely a matter between the MSEB and DPC,''they said. 

Analysts feel that the Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu's words of hope to defuse the Dabhol crisis are not grounded in reality. ``The Centre is totting sale of Dabhol power to third-party as a key solution. However, first, under the existing electricity laws, the Centre cannot authorise third-party sale since it is in the State's domain. Secondly, since it is a purely commercial decision, the Central Electricity Authority's (CEA) intervention does not offer any significant breakthrough.'' Recently, the Power Ministry had instructed the CEA to survey the demand requirement of neighbouring States over the next two years as well as their purchase price.

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 
MSEB unruffled amid power talk , Dinesh Narayanan 

EVEN as officials from various financial institutions and banks split hairs in Singapore on whether to sink or sail with the Dabhol power project, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) is cool about the entire affair. Unlike previous instances when the odds were stacked against it, this time MSEB knows pretty well that whatever happens, it will remain unscathed. If someone has to take a hit, it has to be the financiers and maybe the Governments.At the hearing before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Authority (MERC), the Advocate-General, Mr Goolam Vahanvati, had said on behalf of the board that MSEB was being kind towards Enron when it rescinded the contract for ``material misrepresentation''. One more step, and it's fraud, he had told MERC. 

Knowing this fully well, MSEB has kept its cool throughout the altercation. It firmly believes that if nothing else, it can pin down the company on just this one point at any forum. Enron too has not said at any point of time that it can actually perform as per the ``cold-start graph'' in the power purchase agreement. In fact, it has said such performance -- making available full power in 180 minutes -- is ``not possible'' by any such plant in the world. In a way, it was MSEB's defiant posturing coupled with the Maharashtra Government's passing the buck up that got the Central Government to act. 

One thing evident throughout the crisis is that all the players are trying to save their own skin. In spite of the developments, Enron has played its cards close to its chest, and hinted to institutions at taking a hit on its returns only a few days ago. Even that, Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India Pvt Ltd, is reported to have told Indian lenders, would hinge on substantial give and take. Indian lenders have a genuine case in that they are the ones without any assurances apart from the plant itself. And, they are not in the business of running power plants. They cannot do much except try get the players to somehow shake hands. They had tried to convince the Government some time ago to get MSEB to activate the escrow and increase the letter of credit amount. But they were told off by MSEB which was in no mood to relent. Today's meeting in Singapore remained inconclusive and the talks will continue tomorrow. Tomorrow, Enron will make presentations to lenders at Singapore on what it feels can be done to move ahead. Whatever the outcome of the meeting, MSEB is unlikely to agree to anything that might queer its pitch.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, June 06, 2001 
CEA to assess viability of Dabhol power despatch to various states' ,   Sanjay Jog

THE Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has launched an exercise to assess the viability of the despatch of Dabhol power to various power deficit states across the country, Union  minister of state for power Jayavantiben Mehta on Tuesday. Ms Mehta told The Financial Express that the CEA, which has been asked to undertake this exercise recently, will take into account the burden to be borne by various power deficit states during the despatch of power. Currently, if the power has to be transported from eastern grid to western grid, there is a certain fixed charge imposed on it. ""The CEA will have to carry out this exercise at length so that the exact picture will emerge whether or not the Dabhol power despatch is viable and whether the states are keen to purchase that power,"" the minister added. Ms Mehta said that the Centre will not purchase Dabhol power as its undertakings cannot take the additional burden on them. 

She informed that the Union finance ministry had in no uncertain terms made it clear that the Centre cannot purchase Dabhol power and sell it at cheaper rate to the states, especially when these states owe over Rs 30,000 crore to various Central public sector undertakings. Ms Mehta said that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who has been apprised of the present situation on the Dabhol front, has assured that he would provide necessary assistance, especially technical, to resolve the issue. ""The Centre is quite eager for the resolution of issue and will provide necessary cooperation,"" she added.

Ms Mehta said that she had a meeting with the representatives of the Bank of America and ABN Amro before they left for the Singapore meeting. ""These lenders explained their position and the amount involved in the Dabhol plant. However, they also expressed their wish to participate in finding an acceptable wayout,"" she added.

THE ASIAN AGE, Wednesday, June 06, 2001
Gujarat, Up High on Power Reforms, By Rajesh Unnikrishnan

Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat are moving ahead with implementing reforms in the power sector, even as the reforms in Maharashtra have come to a standstill due to the Dabhol fiasco. Maharashtra was one of the first states to initiate steps for reforms phase-II, by appointing a state regulatory commission and going in for unbundling MSEB. Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board and Delhi Vidyut Board are finalising plans to privatise transmission and distribution, while Gujarat is planning to set up one more power project with private sector participation. 

According to State Bank of India Capital Markets officials, UPSEB is going to float a new tender, inviting private sector players for power supply in Kanpur region. Due to employees' protests against the privatisation, the state electricity board had cancelled its earlier tender floated in 2000.  SBI Caps had also short-listed four companies: L&T, CESC, BSES and Tata Power for transmission and distribution in Kanpur. The officials said: ""UPSEB will come out with a new tariff order for Kanpur by this week end and a new tender will be floated by month-end. We would undertake the short-listing process by mid-July.""They said that besides this, the UP State Industrial Development Corporation is also setting up a 30 MW captive power project for the newly-developed industrial park, Tronica City, in the state. Total cost of the project is estimated at Rs 100 crores and BHEL is the equipment supplier for the project.

SBI Caps short-listed six private players for supplying power in three regions Tata Power, BSES, Reliance Power, China Light&Power, AES, the AV Birla Group and CESC. Two months back, the Delhi government had cleared State Bank of India Caps' proposal for the unbundling of DVB by dividing the board into five separate units. The proposal envisaged three transmission and distribution companies and two generation companies. DVB makes losses to the tune of Rs 1 crore per day. Officials said the Gujarat, on the other hand, is focussed more on generation and the state electricity board recently proposed a 500 MW project in Mundra and invited a proposal from the private sector.

The project will use imported coal as fuel and the state will keep a minimum equity in it. There are two independent power projects in Gujarat: the Reliance-promoted, 500 MW, naphtha-based Hazira project and the 500 MW, gas-based project promoted by Gujarat Power Corporation. According to the officials, the unbundling of Gujarat SEB has failed to take off because the state government has not yet appointed any merchant banker for it. The government initiated the state electricity board unbundling around two years back.

Today's focus: Wireless LAN security, Part 2

By Neal Weinberg

In our review of wireless LAN security solutions, we tested
3Com's Access Point 6000, Avaya's Access Server 1, Cisco's
Aironet 350 access point and Access Control Server, and
Colubris' CN1000. Last time, we looked at the Cisco and
Colubris products. This time, we check out 3Com's and Avaya's
wares.

3Com's Access Point 6000 is a well-designed product. It
features a two-position wireless access point with a flip
antenna as well as a retractable X-Jack antenna on its wireless
network interface card (NIC). The X-Jack lets you store the
antenna in the NIC when not in use, keeping it in your laptop
during transportation.

3Com's Dynamic Security Link technology is similar to Cisco's
Lightweight Extensive Authentication Protocol (LEAP). One
benefit of Dynamic Security Link is that it increases the
number of simultaneous users from 65 to 255.

Furthermore, you don't have to manually enter the 128-bit keys.
The software automatically generates new keys and distributes
them to the client each session. This is great for encryption,
but you still need to provide for authentication.

It took only 60 seconds to set up the access point, but
implementing the full range of security took a while longer.
3Com's browser-based Configuration Management System was
excellent, and the HTML-based documentation was complete and
well organized. In all, 3Com's product had some neat
technology.

Avaya's wireless NIC looked familiar and that's because it was.
It seems that both Colubris and Avaya use NICs from Orinoco.
But Avaya's solution goes far beyond just the NIC.

Avaya's Access Server 1 is a slick tool for managing corporate-
level wireless security. It includes Remote Authentication Dial
In User Server software that runs on any workstation plugged
into the hard-wired LAN. And it employs automatic key
generation and distribution.

Avaya's documentation was very good, with plenty of room set
aside in the form of tables to record the system parameters
administrators in large corporate environments should never
commit to memory.

The Access Server manager provides the full range of management
and diagnostic utilities you'd expect from a top-of-the-line
corporate offering.

Vince:

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

Vince,

Nothing like a real deal to focus our thoughts on JCC.  JA Aichi is an agricultural association that purchases over 200,000kl per year of Heavy A.  They would like Enron to price a JCC swap (our offer) that would help them manage their Oct 2001 to Mar 02 position as given below.  I'd like to see what we could offer given the volumes and term.  We can then compare with the JCC offers shown by MS.  We are checking the credit of this company.

It would be good to put a live deal in front of Shankman that wasn't too huge or of too long term.  Concept of minimizing the cost of our education and testing our hedging strategy for JCC.

Let me know if you need additional info.  I presume that you are fairly far along with evaluation of JCC and that we should be able to derive an offer?  If not, please let me know.  If possible we'd like to send out an offer next week.

thanks.

Joe

Please refer to the conversation we just had.
Customer (JA Aichi) is looking for to hedge Heavy A (Low Sulphar A) with Index as follows : 
I am already contacting Singapore Office for Dubai Index or Singapore Gas Oil Index but not JCC.

2. Index    : JCC 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

Richard-San, Hans-San 

Hi, How are you doing ? 

Have received an inquiry form JA Aichi (Different from UNICOOP) in Japan as follows: 

In order to hedge the price of Low Sulphur A, they want to enter the swap based on 
Crude Oil Index or Gas Oil Index, since it has a correlation with the product. 
It would be very appreciated if you could give me a price as following. 

1. Enron sells swap to JA Aichi (Financially Swap settled monthly)
2. Index    : Dubai Crude Oil, Platts Singapore Gas Oil Reg. 0.5% 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

                  Total         20,000 KL (125,787Barrel)

Should you have any question, please feel free to call me (81-3-5219-4629)

sorry for the inconvenient. I have just sent you the paper by fax. I would

However, it is quite strange what happened to this file. I have opened it
this morning with acrobat reader and it had a pdf extension. I use Acrobat
quite often and sometimes I have problems with particular characters, but
such a thing never happened to me before...

Thank you again for your time and co-operation.

I cannot open the file. When I try to use my Acrobat reader, I get
a message that the file does not begin with %PDF-. The file that

Quick question:

I was wondering if you know anyone who could benefit
from a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk 
 management policy, gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or 
 electric power trading.  
 
 If you do, please make them aware of  PGS Energy Training's
upcoming seminars in downtown Houston (in February) and
downtown Philadelphia (March). 
 http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
Available seminars include:
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)
    6) How to Value Electric Generation Assets as Real Options 
    7) Fundamentals of Value-at-Risk (Soli Forouzan)
 
For seminar dates and hotel information, call 412-279-9298 
or visit  http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
 You can also save money by bringing a group of 4 or more. 
 With a group rate, your cost for $1,295 seminars is reduced 
 to $895 per attendee-- a savings of $1,600 from regular 
 prices. The group price for the $695 programs is $495.
 
As you know, successful people invest the they time need to
improve their career prospects and increase their value to
their organization.  Hope to see you there!

Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Dear all,

Following up with Vince's meeting on full requirement, we might just start with the existing Psim model.
The attached spreadsheet  is still running !

You need to create a directory H:\projects\pwrsim before your run the model.  If you want to re-run the model,
you need to close the report because re-run causes the program re-write the report.

Let us first review what is already there in the PSIM model, if we can live with the simplistic dispatch
logic in PSIM, the PSIM is the deliverable product for the full requirement deal. 

Alex agrees to write an agenda for this project before the Friday meeting.

Hello Vince,

I would like to reiterate my interest in meeting with you to gain a better idea of the type of work conducted within your group at Enron.  This would provide me with an opportunity to see if the activities within your group fit with my expectations.  Additionally, I could expound on my interest and work concerning numerical methods for pricing and hedging derivative securities.  A formal interview could be established at a later date.  For your reference, I've attached a copy of my resume.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am interested in working on a part-time, telecommuting basis
(roughly the equivalent of 1 to 2 days a week) for about a year or
two. I can visit as necessary. I am attaching a brief resume.

Is this something that might be of interest to you? Should you have no
opportunities, can you suggest other groups? I look forward

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press. Hopefully, this
has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.  The
title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting notices.  If
you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this toward the
attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have something to
provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is needed
as soon as possible. Please advise.
Thank you.

Subject:	 

Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Frank

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

My name is Hee Jung Sim who is working with Dr. Deng.
At first, I thank you so much for your listening to my poor
presentation.
During the presentation, you gave me so valuable comments.
Based on your advice, I am separating my work: 1) modeling the
fundamental underlying (such as the internet usage) and 2) valuing
telecommunication service contracts from the point of view of maximizing
the profit of a capacity
owner/broker.
Though I understand you are so busy, I would like to keep contacting

Again, I appreciate your time and comments.

One last reminder ..
Today is really your last day for scheduling final exams with Linda Werckle
(3463).  She will be out of town after today until exams begin.

Also, please remember to turn in your grades for all of your graduating
seniors by Friday, May 4th.  This is the university deadline so we cannot
miss this date.  The registrar needs final information on each student in
order to verify their graduating status.

As always - thank you for your help!

Vince,


Two recruiting seminars this week for the Finance Department that may be of
interest to you.

(1)Thursday, November 29:  Evgenia Portniaguina (University of Utah). She is
completing here Ph.D., and is one of their strongest students ever. She is
originally from Russia with a BS in Exploration Geophysics (4.0 GPA), Oil &
Gas Academy, Russia.  She will now speak on a Finanicial Market
MicroStructure topic, but she could be of great interest from the Energy
Institute point of view.  Her seminar is in Room 256, Melcher Hall,
10:30 -12 noon.

(2) Friday, November 30:  Peter Carr, Adjunct Professor at Courant
Institute, NYU...His specialization is in derivatives (although he will talk
on ""Hedging with Incomplete Markets""). His talk is also in Room 256, 1:30-3
p.m.

SECURITY AND BUG NEWS ALERT:
Users offer tips on foiling Code Red

By Jason Meserve

Code Red, the nasty virus that spread to some 250,000 host
machines a couple of weeks ago, could begin another assault
around 8 p.m. EST today, according to an alert from the FBI and
the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center
(see http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0730codered.html). And
systems administrators are taking no chances.

For those that do find the virus, which affects Windows NT and
2000 servers running Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS), the easiest way to get rid of the problem is to reboot
the infected machine. Because Code Red resides only in memory,
it will be purged when the system shuts down. Once the system
is rebooted, users should install a patch from Microsoft that
fixes the vulnerability Code Red exploits. The proper patches
can be downloaded from:

Windows NT Version 4.0:
http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=30833

Windows 2000 Professional, Server and Advanced Server:
http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=30800

Directions for installing the patch and other information on
the virus is also available from Microsoft at:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/tech
net/security/bulletin/MS01-033.asp

Anyone running IIS should install the patch listed above.

Bud Nelson, a reader of Network World's Security and Bug Patch
Alert newsletter (http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/bug), says
he found the virus on one of his extranet servers and followed
the steps above to rid and protect his machine from future attack.
But he adds, ""I am thinking about removing the network cable
tonight.""

Greg Missman, owner of SecureTips.com, provides the following
tip to make sure the patch from Microsoft is properly
installed:

Look in your event log for an entry like this one (this is an
NT IIS5 Enhanced log):

2001-07-20 21:22:03 216.68.15.61 - 120.195.68.58 80 GET
/default.idaNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN%u9090%u6858%ucb
d3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%
u9090%u8190%u00c3%u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u0000%u00=a 200
190

(Note: The line will be continuous in the log file.)

This means your IIS server logged a request for default.ida
with the underrun data. If you look right after the data ends
you will see a space and 2 sets of numbers.  ""200"" is the code
for ""OK"" and ""190"" is the size in bytes sent to the remote
host.

A ""200"" response on this request is very bad and means you
either have not applied the patch or applied it wrong. Reapply
it, then cut and paste the information from the log (everything
after GET) into your own browser pointing it to your own site.
You should get a ""414"" code after the request in your log
stating that it errored and your server blocked it.

All the hype about Code Red could turn out to be just that -
hype. But the steps for protection are relatively easy, and as
the saying goes, ""Better safe than sorry.""

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours


Jacob

Dear Youyi Feng,

Firstly, I apologize that I haven't contacted you earlier; the reason is
that I've been very busy traveling. We met in Hawaii conference and I
promised to send the paper that I presented there to you. This paper is
now
enclosed and I hope you find the model useful, at least in the future.

In this bandwidth area I'm working closely with my friends (EigenValue
Ltd.)
and they've office in my home country Finland. In the electricity market
I've been consulting few electricity companies in Scandinavia and it
seems
that the market there is working pretty well. I also added one paper in
this
field.

In Hawaii you told me something about your interests in Revenue
Management
models. Fortunately, one of my friend, Costis Maglaras (Professor in
Columbia Business School, c.maglaras@columbia.edu), is working in this
area
and he would be very happy to talk with you about the implementation of
these models into everyday industry practice.

If you are interested I'd very much like to visit Enron and give a talk
there. Especially, I'd like to learn more about your company, the
reputation
of Enron is impressive!

Best regards, Jussi

Ron,

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the Enron's point of view.


Please, let us know if this is required.

Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:

The following is this week's Alliance Express newsletter, and a special announcement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

FASB 133
FASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives.  A vote against the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility, and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers.  (Attached is a summary of this issue.)  The Board is expected to vote on this issue during May 2001.  EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns.  If you, or company CFO would like more information about this effort, please contact Richard McMahon, Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy Suppliers, at rmcmahon@eei.org, or at 202-508-5571.


                             Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express?April 25, 2001
INSIDE WASHINGTON

FEDERAL AFFAIRS

***Bill Repealing PUHCA Is Approved By Senate Committee***
The Senate Banking Committee today approved S 206, a bill that repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  The bill would repeal PUHCA and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and appropriate state agencies.
S.206 was approved with two amendments.  Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), the first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of representatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of Agriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also contained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), that would preserve FERC's authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass-through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy.
Another amendment, offered by Sen. Jon Corzine (D-NJ), initiated a study by the General Accounting Office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets.

 ***Institute?s Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hill***

The tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association (APPA) and the Large Public Power Council (LPPC) again has been introduced in the House.  The bill (HR 1459) contains the same provisions as were in a measure (HR 4971), with technical corrections, introduced during the 106th Congress.  HR 1459 was introduced by Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine original co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee.

HR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes:  1) The tax-free sale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking, 3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities.

The measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has urged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward.  Enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute noted.  The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and stand-alone legislation could also be introduced.  Hearings are expected to be held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, probably after consideration of President Bush's individual tax proposal.

 ADMINISTRATION/FERC

***White House Seeks $2 Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year 2002***

President Bush last week transmitted a $2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to Capitol Hill.  The Administration noted that its proposal *moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002,* an increase of $26 billion over the preceding fiscal year.  The budget bid contains a $231 billion total surplus in 2002, and projects a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next ten years.

In the energy area, the Administration noted the federal government?s *longstanding and evolving role* in the sector, pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts.  It proposed about $2.8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs, and about $2.1 billion in tax benefits, *mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources.*  DOE?s budget request was $19.2 billion, including $2.3 billion for energy resources programs.  This later figure represents a decrease of $196 million, or 7.9 percent, from fiscal year 2001.

In the environmental sector, the Administration sought some $7.3 billion in discretionary funding for EPA, including a $3.7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws.

 ***Success of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy, FERC?s Massey Asserts***

Electric restructuring may be in jeopardy, and its success *is in the hands of regulators and policymakers,* FERC Commissioner William Massey has asserted.  Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum in Philadelphia, Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy.

First, he specified, there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity.  Turning to a second element, Commissioner Massey told forum attendees that *all the supply in the world won?t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate, efficient, non-discriminatory network.*  Commissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy, while citing an inherent difficulty: that *good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions.*  Accordingly, he said, FERC and the states must work together on market structure.

The final element of a successful energy strategy, the commissioner specified, is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail to do their job.  *If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers,* he cautioned, they *will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path.*

NEW GENERATION

***Dynegy To Build Second Plant in Kentucky***

Dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to the Riverside Generating project in Lawrence County, Kentucky.  Dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market.  Commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002.

***PPL To Expand Generation Capacity***

PPL Corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near Chicago and would increase the capacity of its Susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 megawatts.  CEO William Hecht said the Illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of 2002.

***Constellation Energy Group Announces Eight New Plants***

Constellation Energy Group  this week announced that the company is scheduled to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer.  Additionally, four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers.   The four peaking plants are located in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.  The larger power plants are under construction in California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.

*We?re building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business,* said Constellation Energy Group Chairman and CEO Christian Poindexter.

***California Energy Commission Approves Construction of Otay Mesa Generating Plant***

PG&E Corporation?s National Energy Group (NEG) last week announced that the California Energy Commission (CEC) has approved construction of the Otay Mesa Generating Plant in San Diego County, which the NEG has developed.  The 500 megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes.  After the development process is completed, Calpine Corporation will assume ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant.  NEG will contract for up to half the plants output.

ENERGY DATA

*** Weekly Electric Output (Week 15)***

Electric output reached 63,528 GWh for the week ending April 14 (Week 15), with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the South Central states, which both had a 12.6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15.  Year-to-date, the Rocky Mountain region experienced the greatest increase in output (7.6 percent) over 2000. For more information, email alliance@eei.org.

Importance:	High


Hi Mark,

	
  	This email is in reference to our meeting today regarding the following issues:
		1.  Meeting with Mark Braemer (??) to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models (to be released this summer).
		2.  Your willingness to let us use some of your data (in files on the 6th floor) to experiment with Moody's RiskCalc.

	In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process - especially the subjective component.  Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties.

	Also, thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the 6th floor.  We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down.

 
	More specifically, to evaluate Moody's RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enron's North American (private firm) counterparties:

		
 	
Fiscal Year
The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year's (1999) inflation level. In general this 'estimation error' will not cause any great problems, as size affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not). 

Cash & Equivalents
This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities. 

Inventory
Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, insurance costs, and storage costs.

Current Assets
This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, marketable securities, and other current assets. 

Total Assets
Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, and investments and advances). Leave previous year's total assets blank for Australian companies. 

Current Liabilities
Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. 


Total Liabilities
This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest). 


Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior year's retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

Sales
This item consists of the industry segment's gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers. 

Cost of Goods Sold
Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies. 

EBIT
Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income. 

Interest Expense
This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities. 


Net Income
This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous year's net income blank for Australian companies. 



Extraordinary Items
Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous year's extraordinary items blank for Australian companies. 


Country
This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia. 





Thanks for your assistance,
Iris

Today's focus: McVeigh video really a virus

By Jason Meserve (write me at jmeserve@nww.com)

You knew someone would take advantage of the recent execution
of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to spread a virus.
According to a number of computer security types, a purported
video of the McVeigh execution circulating the 'Net is actually
a virus that drops the SubSeven backdoor onto infected systems.

For those who don't know, SubSeven can be used to take over
control of the infected machine and be used in distributed
denial-of-service attacks. The good news is that most updated
antivirus scanners already detect this virus, so if your
systems are up to date, you should be safe.

For more on this, check out this wire story posted on
DigitalMass.com:

Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* SQL security hole lets attackers take over

A security flaw in Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server
2000 Gold can allow an attacker to take control of a targeted
server, the company said in a security bulletin late Tuesday
night. Microsoft issued a patch for the flaw at the same time
it released the bulletin.

* Microsoft has third go at Exchange hole

Microsoft has issued a third version of a patch intended to
plug a security hole that could allow hackers access to
mailboxes on Exchange Server Versions 5.5 and 2000. The second
patch contained outdated files, Microsoft said in an updated
security bulletin issued Wednesday.

* HP warns of potential DoS vulnerability in kmmodreg

Hewlett-Packard is warning its HP-UX operating system users of
a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the kmmodreg
command, which is executed each time the system is booted. The
problem with the package also could be used to increase
privileges on the affected system. HP-UX users can download a
patch for the kmmodreg problem by logging on to HP's IT
Resource Center at:
http://itrc.hp.com


* Xinetd patch released by Linux OS vendors

Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package
that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP
WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web
application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd
package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a
symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch

* Linux-Mandrake fixes imap flaw

According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have
been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an
authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This
is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not
normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Conectiva patches exim

A printf vulnerability exists in exim, a mail transfer utility.

* Red Hat issues patch for ispell

According to an alert from Red Hat, the ispell program uses
mktemp() to open temporary files, which makes it vulnerable to
symlink attacks. For more information and to download a patch:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-074.html


* GnuPG patch available for Red Hat Linux users

GnuPG, an open source version of PGP, contains a number of
flaws that could leave a user's private key exposed. The
problem is a format string vulnerability in GnuPG's code. For
more information and links to the appropriate download:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-073.html


* Red Hat: LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership

According to an alert from Red Hat, LPRng fails to drop
supplemental group membership at init time, though it does
properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its
children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process
starting LPRng had at the time it started LPRng. This is a
security risk. Download the appropriate patch from:

Today's round up of virus alerts:


* Simpsons worm hits Macs

When the Mac vs. PC wars start up, as they inevitably do, on
Usenet or Web message boards or just around the office, Mac
partisans always tout the dearth of viruses for their chosen
computer as one of the main benefits in adopting Apple's
operating system. And though, technically, there still may not
be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has
recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and
Powerbooks everywhere.

* Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL

Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his
hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray
Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e-
mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an
initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a
new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus
seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a
virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet
access to millions of people worldwide.

* WM97/Opey-AU - This Word macro virus removes the macros

It also displays five different messages on five different

* Hackers taunt EC with site defacement

Dutch hackers on Tuesday evening defaced SaferInternet.org, a

* Microsoft plugs seven Telnet security holes in Windows 2000

If the Telnet service included with Microsoft's Windows 2000

issued a patch late last week.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
bring
our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
working with Duke,
and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!

According to Erik, Media Services would still like to have Research participate in the meeting.  He will let me know the exact date and time, however, it will be close to the date that you had discussed with me.

Media Services would like to have Research present an example where we had applied some novel and sophisticated analysis to a problem that may show applicability to issues in the advertising business.  Essentially, they would like a relevant success story with a great wow-factor.

Subject:	Neptune

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

Ed

I spoke with Jill to discuss the program with her and conveyed to her that compared with other candidates, she would be suited more as an analyst.  Currently, we are only hiring at the Associate level.  I also told Jill that the HR Associate/Analyst program was not the only way to begin a career in HR with Enron.  Jill will be one of the first we consider when we are hiring at the Analyst level later this year.  
 
Thank you for your further recommendation of a great candidate.  I will let you know when we are seeking to hire more HR Analysts.

Subject: Nat Gas - Big Picture recent updates
Friday August 10th marked at  the very least - Momentum Bear Market Low 
 
So,  the actual low came in a day earlier than  anticipated and about 15-17 cents above the 2.75-2.77 target. Check the intraday  out that suggested a rally would unfold following theFriday August 10th low.  
 
Sure enough, natural gas rallied over 20% the  following week. This may be no more than a short covering rally, as double  bottoms are always to be viewed with suspiciously. Thus far, in the month of  August, natural gas has taken out both the July lows and the July highs forming  an outside bar on the month. Will need to monitor the 2nd qtr close of 2001  closely to gauge whether the July and August double bottom is going to hold or  not. At the very least, the double bottom makes a  fantastic momentum low,  if not the actual intermediate bear market price low. 
 
                                         Setting up for an August 27th Three Year Anniversary Low  
 
Lo and behold, Friday August 10 did indeed turn out  to be no more than a Momentum Bear Market Low.  As usual, double bottoms  and tops always make good candidates for failure. But boy what a short covering  rally that was, good for 20% plus in couple of days. In any event, the update to  the monthly chart shows support in the 240-280 zone. Ideally, the bottom will be  seen at or above the November 1990 high at 2.65.  The 85 minute intraday  chart shows an expanding formation setting up a 4 point buy. Noteworthy is the  1.41 ratio at 263.5 that ties in so well with the old 1990 high at 2.65. Of  course downside momentum is strong enough to hammer into the 250's but it would  surprise to see such strong follow through to the downside momentum during the  week of August 27th.  
 
One reason to anticipate downside momentum will  subside next week is a time cycle. Intriguingly, the 3rd step down from the Dec  2000 high will equal the 1st step down in time on Monday August 27th.  And  that time symmetry would be ideal as it ties in so well with the 3 year  anniversary low that began that bull campaign to the Dec 2000 high in the first  place.

Dear Vince

Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently
inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia,
which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had an
opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the
programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as
possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.

I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852 2545

Kind regards.

I have been pretty busy too,
to finish a project and write a paper, these days.

Everything looks going OK for my summer internship.
I took necessary steps to work out of campus, and sent
signed contract to Molly a week ago..

Here is what I am expecting to do in the summer.
Please let me know if you have any change in mind.
Actually, I wonder a little bit if DealBench changed its business model...
and maybe you got priority in something different
because it has been quite a while since we talked.
I'd like to what's going on in DealBench team...
Raghavan and Ross,
if we talk over phone it will be great!

Dr. Kaminski,
If you think there is something else interesting to work with during the
summer,
to both you and I, please let me know.
My interest is auction, market design, and simulation.
I am taking a financial engineering class, (mostly on option pricing)
and working on electricity generator valuation problem based on
spark spread option.

All of you,
Let's keep in touch until we meet in June!!

Vince,

I have never had a chance to formally meet you but many people have said that you would be a wonderful person to talk to seek advice from.  I have a couple of directions that I am considering for careers right now (in risk management) and it would mean a lot to me to be able to sit down with you for a little bit to get your perspective.  Is there anyway I could buy you coffee or lunch sometime over the week or so?

Thanks,
Jason Jennaro

It's interesting MS wants to be only on one side of the transaction.
I think it reflects their ability to hedge. Any other thoughts?

Jeff/Vince,

One of our potential customers provided us with MS's daily price sheet from earlier this week.  Interesting to see the JCC offers that have been provided.  Some of the WTI offers look fairly rich as well, particularly the 10 yr price.  MS also requires fairly hefty cash collateral requirements.

Thought this might be of interest in determing how competitive we could be with JCC.

Yes, That's fine.  If you can please give me her full contact details
including e-mail and address I will have her registered as a co-speaker.

If you would like to bring your own copies to the event I would ask you to
send 200 copies directly to the venue.  Although if you can get it to me on
Friday I can still insert it!

Could I please trouble you for a short biography?

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her
the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates
rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards

Subject:	FW: NAO/AO and Sudden Stratospheric Warming Presentation

To All:

Please mark your calendars for 26 September between 10 and about 11:30 a.m., as we willl be having
a special visitor from Northwest Research Associates who will deliver a presentation on the North
Atlantic/Arctic Oscillation (NAO/AO) and Sudden Stratospheric Warmings.  I encourage each of you
to attend, as this will be a very informative and worthwhile seminar.  

Mark, along with other noted researchers at the University of Washington, Colorado State University, and
the ECWMF in Redding, are beginining to unravel some of the vagaries of the NAO/AO and to develop the
necessary tools to predict wintertime temperature and precipitation weeks ahead of time. I have asked
Mark to start from scratch and spend some time on fairly rudimentary concepts pertaining to the NAO/AO
and Sudden Stratoshperic Warmings.  He then will build up to his research and discuss where he thinks 
short-term progress can be made in terms of skillful wintertime temperature and precipitation predictions. 
Although many of you sat in on my NAO presentation from early this year, I can guarantee you that 
attending his talk will be worth your while. 

Mark's main focus will be to elaborate on what diagnostic tools and modeling schemes can be used to 
anticipate certain extreme phases of the NAO/AO and the likelihood of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings. These 
can, in turn, be used to something about the probability of cold air outbreaks or heavy snow episodes over parts 
of North America and perhaps parts of the world (for example).

In the end, Joe and I plan to take Mark to lunch to discuss a possible research collaboration between him/ECWMF 
and ENRON. 

I will provide the conference room number and any additional information as we get closer to 26 September.


Todd

My apologies for the delay. As you know we have hit some turbulence here at Enron
and I was quite busy.

The title of the talk:


Measurement of  Volatility in the Energy Markets:

1. Importance  of volatility in financial engineering
	a. option pricing
	b. risk management
	c. legacy software systems

2. Is volatility the right tool for energy markets?

3. The dynamics of energy prices in the US markets in recent years: a few stylized facts

4. Alternative theoretical tools to represent price dynamics: the importance 
   of dialogue between academics and practitioners


Also, can you give me some indication of the timing
of different meetings?

Vince,

I am attaching some powerpoint slides that I have prepared for the EMBAs in
Dallas.  I wanted to share them in the event that you might find them
useful (don't feel the need to use them however as they are self-contained
notes that the students can use independently of your comments).

John McCormack and I will await your arrival at the Cooper Center tomorrow
night before going to dinner.  Shirley sent me your schedule which
indicates your arrival at Love Field at 6:20.  I suspect that you can be at
the Cooper Center by 7:30 so if you will give me a call when you arrive we
can gather together for dinner.

Thanks again for taking the time out of your very busy schedule to help out
in my class.

your friend,

John

p.s. I hope your cross country trip went well.

Sorry for being terse.  It is Hanover Compressor.  R2 was long swap @ $44.875 (about 5.5 MM shares) with a collar ($34.875 and $94.68), according to my information. It is presently trading around $30.

Vince,

I met with Gordon yesterday and have up-to-date information on the public and private hedges we placed in Raptors 1 and 2.  There has been value loss there.  The following are the current values for R1. I shall cross-check the values again before we model these into our liquidation valuation.
For R2, HC is the only remaining value, it appears.  However, we have already entered into a contract with Bear and Stearns who are shorting HC presently and wll settle with Enron around October, 2001, after Enron makes its sale.  So, it may not be relevant if we want to look at the liquidation value at maturity from a volatility perspective.

Thanks.

Makes sense. Let's meet with Gordon. I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting. 

Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?

I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's
liquidity at some point.

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

Theresa,

I returned the laptop labelled 'Research' to the cubicle right outside of 1968.  I was told that the person who sits there is not in today, so I wanted to let you know what has been done with it.

MARKETPLACE
ENRON PAYS TVA $200-MILLION TO END SUIT CLAIMING MARKETER BREACHED SALES DEAL

03/05/2001
Power Markets Week
10
Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill. Reproduction forbidden without permission.

The Tennessee Valley Authority said it received more than $200-million from Enron from a January lawsuit settlement involving Enron's alleged failure to meet the terms of an option sales contracts with TVA during summer and winter peaking periods since 1998. 
TVA revealed the gain from the settlement Feb. 27 in a quarterly financial report.
The two sides would not comment further on the deal that appears to settle the TVA lawsuit and a countersuit from Enron that had been filed in Federal District Court in Chattanooga in early 1999, nor would they discuss the terms of the settlement. 
The settlement may end a series of disputes between Enron and TVA which began in 1995 when Enron signed a 10-year options contract to supply peaking power to TVA starting in 1998. The size of the contract was never disclosed but it was believed to cover up to 1,400 MW. Enron quickly built four gas-fired combustion turbine units in the region totaling 1,850 MW and set up its own control area inside the TVA territory to give itself more flexibility to use the turbines to either supply TVA or trade for outside supplies. 
However, in 1999 problems arose when Enron said it was unable to get sufficient transmission capacity from TVA to make the control area work. And in early 2000, Enron charged that TVA was slow to respond to transmission service requests for the merchant plants in its territory, hampering the supplier's ability to market the power if TVA didn't use it. 
TVA, though, said Enron was purposely jamming its transmission system for competitive reasons. TVA also began an aggressive campaign to build its own combustion turbine projects in the region and meet peaking needs through its in-house production, using less on the Enron capacity which it said was unreliable. 
The transmission dispute led to the TVA lawsuit, in which the utility charged that Enron failed to deliver energy under the agreements during summer peak periods forcing it to buy replacement power at higher costs. It made several requests to the court for compensation for specific replacement power costs through early 2000. 
Enron and TVA officials would not say whether the original options contract between them was still in effect. or was terminated as part of the settlement. TVA also currently has several RFP's pending for new independent power supplies for both short term and long term periods.

BRIEFS
TVA WINS $200M FROM ENRON

03/05/2001
Southeast Power Report

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The Tennessee Valley Authority has revealed that it received ``in excess of $200-million'' from Enron in January 2001 as part of a lawsuit settlement involving Enron's alleged failure to meet the terms of a power sales contract during the summers of 1998 and 1999. 
TVA said in a Feb. 27 quarterly financial report that it would use the proceeds from the settlement for debt reduction.
The two sides would not comment further on the TVA lawsuit, the settlement, or a countersuit from Enron that had been filed in Federal District Court in Chattanooga in 1999.

Kymberly Booth will be your new HR representative, and will be setting up a meeting with you shortly.  I would have liked to have been able to take the time to introduce you to Kym, but with my ski trip, I don't think that is going to be able to happen.
 
Please know though that I will always be of service to you and your great team, and if there is anything that I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to let me know.

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EBS Joins EWS
Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into those units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following units:
Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidated into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implemented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel and entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing (""GSS"") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to enlist your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message will focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on travel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adjustments.

?	Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separate channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  The first is Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP""), or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTrip, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of reasons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective travel decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use of this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, ClickTrip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and after-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questions, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
 
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.

?	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates including insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is available regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, pulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving approximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled paper), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throughout the world.  

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physical product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 million tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, and physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coordinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per year.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordinated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billion cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed the divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via an all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial and industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. (""Tropigas"").  Upon completion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market player will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market share, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer. 

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between Protane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (SJG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Caribe.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million. 

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail propane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Protane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy the cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resources. 

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect them against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innovative winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both the volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Chicago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is looking for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interested in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic quarter!  

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 earnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thursday, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this quarter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quarter up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quarter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Continental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to strength as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this quarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volumes are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in the same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 TWh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however, and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the closing of EES' first, major ""marquis"" brand energy outsourcing transaction with supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000.  The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the development of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, more recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct Canada.  

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value of transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, Enron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 readers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent publications.   

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this year, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the development of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading in Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial pursuit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather derivatives. 

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progress with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being successfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milestone in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. The transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one of ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power supply contract through 2010.  

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quarter with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen positive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Project Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the metals team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transaction proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's trading and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups across Enron.   

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we've witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, when talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter, ""Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, nearly double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the size of the US.""

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.  Rusty is a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these issues pertain to the energy industry.   In fact, you met Rusty during your recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an interview for a summer internship on April 19.  He has been invited by Althea Gordon.  If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.   Rusty is one of the very best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

I was waiting till Kevin gets back - he's cleaning up 30c2

He has a file on it all

$300 per month seems like a lot, but we use the heck out of it 

for communications daily with Tony, for video briefing preparation

I know it needed it's own server, but I want to make sure we only pay our fair share

I'll let you know accurate cost allocation as soon as kevin returns

Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Vince:

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,
Ehud

Subject:	Argentina FX and CPI curves, dated 6/20/01

Cindy,

Please find attached the Argentine peso and CPI forecast.

It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had been expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dollar currency board.  The economy ministry took a first step toward this new basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker euro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros and 50% US dollars.  At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the basket.  An 8% devaluation at this juncture does not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis-a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year.  Initial reports indicate that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt service at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one).  

With such a change in currency regime as being contemplated in the Argentine Congress, investor confidence could wane if the plan is approved and as the implications of the new plan are interpreted by the market and as the sustainability of the existing currency board arrangement outside the export sector is analyzed.  A loss of investor confidence will put additional pressure on the peso, pressure which has not existed previous to this new announcement by economy chief Cavallo, especially now that the government's debt swap (exchanging short-term goverment paper for longer-term bonds) has been successfully executed.  As a consequence, although our forecast attached below assumes a one-for-one peso peg to the US dollar at this point to allow the quarterly revaluations to be completed in a timely fashion, this curve is subject to change upon knowledge of the Congressional vote and an analysis of the details announced with the vote as to the mechanics of this new basket regime for exporters and for the economy as a whole.

Gwyn Koepke and
Maureen Raymond-Castaneda

I am sorry that I have been out of pocket all week and did not have access to my e-mail.  I have just returned from NY and want to thank you for all of your hard work in helping us track the data.  You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.

Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described here.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.


IN THE NEWS

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp., EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday.

The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursing mergers or acquisition for now, according to Greg Piper.


UNITED WAY 2001
United Way Campaign:  Stay tuned...Enron kicks-off the company-wide United Way campaign on Monday, August 6.  It ends Friday, August 17.  EWS is shooting for 100% participation in this year's on-line campaign.   
Days of Caring: The United Way ""Days of Caring"" are August 6-10. Volunteers are rapidly signing up for the EWS day scheduled for August 10. The 2001 theme is ""Building Houston's Future"" and EWS is sponsoring the Center for the Retarded.  There is a competition between the four Enron companies; EWS, Enron Corp., ETS, and EES to see which one provides the most volunteers.  Sign up and receive your Day of Caring T-shirt at the Infozone located in the Enron Building Plaza from July 30 to August 3.
Everyone in EWS who participates in the Days of Caring will have their name entered into a drawing to win one of five American Express Gift Certificates.

Day of Caring Volunteer Information
Transportation:  Shuttles will be provided for all projects if needed.  Loading and unloading of buses will be on Ruthvan street, between the Enron Building and the Continental Building.  Morning shifts will leave at 8:15am and return to Enron at 11:30am.  Afternoon shifts will leave at 1:00pm and return at 4:00pm.

Food:  Doughnuts and juice will be available to all morning volunteers.  Enron will also provide boxed lunches at noon at the Enron building. For those volunteers staying all day at their site, we will send lunches on the 1:00pm bus.  

Water:  Water and ice will be provided at the Enron Building before the buses leave.  Volunteers are encouraged to bring coolers from home to load water.

T-shirts:  T-shirts can be picked up at EB1638e.  T-shirts will also be available while loading the busses.

Materials:  Enron and United Way will provide any materials needed for your project.  (i.e. paint, brushes, dirt, plants, books, etc).  Volunteers are encouraged to bring their own gloves and other items for their comfort (i.e. paint shirts, caps, bug spray, sunscreen, kneeling pads, etc).  Talk to your site leader to find out about other tools that are needed.

Showers:  Enron's Body Shop has provided showers for all Day of Caring volunteers.  Waivers will be available on the bus ride to the Enron Building.  Wear your shirt and sign in at the registration desk at The Body Shop.

United Way Challenge:  To compete against the other business units, EWS must create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  The primary building material will be Legos.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit childcare centers.
On Friday, August 10 at 11:00 am, the teams will meet to begin construction and they have 45 minutes to complete their model of Enron's attributes.  At 12:00 pm, Ken Lay will host the judging competition with the winner decided using ""The Applause Meter.""
Each team must consist of 7 to 10 members from their business unit and must have at least 3 executives (i.e., Directors or above).  The model must be freestanding.  And, although Legos will be provided as the primary building tool, other materials may be used, so use your imagination.
Please call or e-mail Julie Clyatt if you are interested in participating.  She can be reached at ext. 3-3256.

Vince,

I have had several requests from interns who are interested in giving to the United Way campaign.  Personally, I am of the opinion that the campaign drive really does not pertain to the summer folks and that they should keep their money.  While I have appreciated their efforts/thoughtfulness in this regard, it doesn't seem appropriate for them to pledge given a) the amount of money they're making over the 3 month period and b) the time of service to the company.  I'll be happy to suggest otherwise to them if you think that it is appropriate.

Subject:	MARGARITA PARTY!! (now that I have Mike's attention...)

Dear Band of Brothers!  (sorry...I'm reading Ambrose's book by the same name)

Scott Tholan and I thought it'd be cool to pull together the old Skunk Works crew for a reunion.  The goal of the meeting is to brainstorm data collection technologies and applications to better serve Enron customers -->> we want to get ahead of customer needs rather than forever being reactive to requirements blowing in from left field.  This is not necessarily about dreaming up whiz-bang technologies.  It's about pooling our knowledge of customer information gaps, and identifying old/new technologies to collect data that make our customers smarter and richer. 

 A steady flow margaritas would free the collective brainpower and creativity.  Who else is cleared into TAC programs and should be a part of this shindig?

Scott's out next week, so let's shoot for Tues, 11 SEP.  Let's say from 1500hrs until??  I'm serious about the margaritas.......

Any problems with this date/time?

Many thanks and looking forward to a good session!

 Ciao - Chris

Ehud and I will meet tomorrow to start sketching out the February
conference.  Let me know if you have any strong opinions of issues that you
think we should discuss.  Ehud will write a formal letter to Skilling
inviting him to the conference.

When we have the opportunity, I would like to have a discussion with you
about what the people at Enron think they understand and do not understand
about valuation.  Also, do you think it is an advantage that you are doing
business with relatively naive financial institutions or a disadvantage?

I'm thinking that it might make sense to run a one or two day executive
program on valuation which would include participants from energy companies
and financial institutions.  Let me know if you think you could get support
for this at Enron?

By the way, I still need a name and address to send my check back.  I think
Shirley can take care of it.

Thanks,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more

Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in ""Econophysics.""  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an ""Econophysics"" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).

Today's focus: Red Hat no longer sings ""When I'm 64""

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

* Red Hat releases version 7.2 for 64-bit processors
* Links related to Linux

Today's focus: Red Hat no longer sings ""When I'm 64""

By Phil Hochmuth

Linux distributor Red Hat last week made two announcements that
should make proponents of 64-bit Linux servers happy: it
released Red Hat Linux 7.2 for both the Intel Itanium and
Compaq Alpha processors.

Although Red Hat was previously able to run on Alpha and
Itanium platforms, the software did not take full advantage of
their 64-bit processing power. But version 7.2 for 64-bit
computing includes the newest Linux kernel (2.4.9), with
features such as higher symmetrical multiprocessing scaling and
ext3 journaling file system.

The support for these features, Red Hat says, will allow the
operating system to take better advantage of the Alpha and
Itanium platforms, which can process much larger file sizes and
handle larger address spacing than 32-bit systems.

Red Hat Linux 7.2 includes other enhancements such as improved
USB support, network configuration and user management
applications, plus a firewall configuration program that can be
configured during server setup.

Itanium is the latest iteration of Intel's PC processor, and is
catching on with users who run high-end Web servers and
enterprise-level application. Prior to Itanium, the Alpha was
the big dog among the 64-bit processor platforms. Although
Compaq has said it will phase out its 64-bit Reduced
Instruction Set Computing processor over the next few years,
Alpha systems are still used widely in database and Web
transactions servers in industries such as finance, medical,
and supercomputing research.

Subject:	1st Draft New Risk Management Policy

OK, here's the working draft ""masterpiece"" (haha).   Please review and provide comments and feedback by the end of the week (note: Ted and David, we have a conference call scheduled Wednesday for the three of us to discuss).   Also, I'm sending to Price Waterhouse Coopers for their input as well - I need to spend more time reviewing what they sent on Friday to see if I've missed any issues we want to address.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to ""cushion"" the reception. 

Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with:
?	Dave Gorte,
?	Bill Bradford and Molly Harris
?	Sally Beck's group (Beth Apollo and James New)
?	Treasury (Perkins and later, Despain)
?	Internal Audit (Kilchrist)
?	Legal (Sayre/Taylor)

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.  


Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

"RE: Spring 2001 Energy Finance Conference Participation by Jeffrey  K. Skilling","Joannie:

Thanks
Here is the message for Jeff:



Jeff,

I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation
at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference
is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the
conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).

This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered
in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management
and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda
for the 2002 event is under development.


Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, 
a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation
will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other
energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the 
agenda for the future.

Rick,

Would you look us to make a joint appeal to Jeff to speak
at this conference? Our friends at UT were very disappointed last
time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should
try to get on his schedule early for the 2002 event.

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn

Hi Vince,

During our chat at the Texas Finance Festival you spoke of the need to hire
technically competent yet creative individuals. I know of someone you might
be interested in.

We run an M.Sc. program in Finance at UBC. One of our graduates came into
our program with a Ph.D in physics and went on to be one of our top
graduates. He spent his summer at the Bank of Canada and they hired him upon
graduation. He is currently in their Calgary office. I happened to be
corresponding with him recently and he mentioned that he would like to leave
the Bank but stay in Calgary. I thought of Enron as a possibility and
wondered if you thought there would be some interest. I think he would make
an outstanding contribution to any firm he worked for.

I hope you don't mind this imposition but I didn't want potential gains from
trade to pass by. If you are interested, please let me know.

Hope all is well with you.

Cheers
ron

Subject:	California Update 6/1/01


Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is also not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric futures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return for money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor this plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve California's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish legislators, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and business leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power Authority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up transmission lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly legislated authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power companies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee a 5%-15% ""cushion"" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton want to create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector generation.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new plants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds (in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in the Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consumers and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this group and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45% increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there is immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on businesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by previous PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent emergency tax hikes (being serious considered last week).  
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owed debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to ""eat"" in the legislated repayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts be?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.

Latha

Thanks for asking!

I'd like to leave San Francisco
non-stop to Houston on United
1556 at 11:10 am Jan 9, arriving 4:44pm,
then go to Austin on the late
afternoon of the 10th (for a seminar at UT),
then I need to get from Austin to San Francisco
on the evening of the 11th.
(There is a United flight 419 connecting through Denver
that leaves Austin at 5:30 pm,
connecting to United 409 out of Denver).
If there is a non-stop from Austin to
San Francisco or San Jose, that is even
better. (United, my preferred, does
not have a non-stop from Austin to
the Bay Area.)

The cost will be shared 50-50 with U. Texas,
if that's OK with you and them. I have copied
the organizer of the seminar there,
Professor Ron Kaniel.

Warm regards,

Darrell

set the location.

The URL for our commodity option calculator demonstration is

Note that several of the data sets, which we obtain daily from NYMEX, are
incomplete. NG, HO, CN, NT and CL have enough data to indicate performance.
The others are either missing altogether or the series is too short to be
useful.

If you want to see the currency demonstration, it is at

Dear Vince J Kaminski,

As a Mathematical Trading and Finance MSc student (City
University London) I am writing my dissertation on ""power
forward curves"".

Since you have participated in the writing of the
book ""Managing Energy Price"" I was wondering if you could
eventually help me.
The MRHV model seams to be the best econometric one to
model the electricity forward curve.

I understand and know how to work out with the classic Mean
Reverting Process, but I don't understand the MRHV (I don't
know the discretised form and I cannot even find any paper,
or article on it) and how to get rid of the exponent to
estimate my parameters (long-run mean, Speed of mean
reversion, volatility, exponent, Floor price).

Thank you by advance for any help

Yours sincerely
Sylvain Joret

Abstract
A probabilistic framework for the analysis of screen-based trading activity is presented. Probability functions are derived for the stationary distributions of the best bid and offer, conditional on the order flows. By identifying the unobservable order and acceptance flows, our estimation method permits the prediction of the stationary distributions of other market statistics. A test is proposed that allows a comparison of predicted and sample bid-ask spread distributions taking parameter estimation error into account. The methodology is applied to the screen-based interbank foreign exchange market, using continuously recorded quotes on the Deutschemark/US dollar exchange rate.

Variance increases following large stock distributions: the role of changing bid--ask spreads and true variances

Received 1 June 1992; Revised 1 December 1992
Abstract
In this study we examine two factors affecting variance increases following stock distributions: changing bid--ask spreads and the true variability of the underlying value of the firm. Employing data from the CRSP NASDAQ and NMS files, we find a relatively minor role for changing spreads. Increases in true variances are the major component of variance increases with changes in return autocorrelations playing an important role.

Bid--ask spreads with indirect competition among specialists

a , Institut zur Erforschung der wirtschaftlichen, Entwicklung, Universit?t Freiburg, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany
b , Humanities and Social Sciences 228-77, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA
Abstract
We examine the prices quoted by specialists (or dealers) who have monopoly power to set prices (bids and asks) for a given asset, but who face indirect competition from other specialists who trade in related assets. In the context of a simple model where investors have mean-variance preferences, we characterize the equilibrium bids and asks quoted by K specialists in N assets, where some specialists may control more than one asset. We compare the equilibrium spreads as the number (and factor structure) of the assets each specialist controls is varied. It is shown that for some constellations of initial portfolio holdings and asset covariance it is socially preferred to have competing specialists, while for others it is socially preferred to have their actions coordinated (or to have one specialist control several assets). In a simple factor model, we show how the optimal specialist control structure depends on whether the assets trade as substitutes or complements. In some situations it is beneficial to have specialist power concentrated within industries, in other situations, across industries, and in yet other situations, not to be concentrated at all. ? 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Explaining the intra-day variation in the bid--ask spread in competitive dealership markets -- A research note

b , Centre for Economic Policy Research, 25-28 Old Burlington Street, London, England W1X 1LB, UK
Abstract
There are many possible explanations for variation in the inside bid--ask spread during the trading day, including informed trading, price inelastic market demand, price discovery, statistical artefact and market concentration. Each of these explanations is examined for consistency with respect to both the inside and average bid--ask spread, observed both inside and outside the mandatory quote period in the London Stock Exchange. ? 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Asymmetric information and the bid-ask spread: an empirical comparison between automated order execution and open outcry auction 
a Jianxin Wang
a , School of Banking and Finance, University of New South Wales, , Sydney 2052, Australia
Received 1 April 1998; Accepted 1 September 1998
Abstract
This study examines the components of the bid-ask spread on the Sydney Futures Exchange. The Exchange uses open outcry auction for daytime trading, and switches to a screen-based automated order execution system at 16:30 h for overnight trading. After controlling for proxies of order flow characteristics, the study finds that screen-based traders are more sensitive to market volatility than floor-based traders in setting the bid-ask spread. Spreads from floor trading have a smaller adverse information component but a larger order processing cost component relative to screen trading. The results suggest that floor traders can better assess the presence of adverse information than screen traders.

Limit orders and the bid--ask spread

University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, , , USA
Marshall University, Huntington, WV 25755, , , USA
Received 29 December 1997; Accepted 23 September 1998
Abstract
We examine the role of limit-order traders and specialists in the market-making process. We find that a large portion of posted bid--ask quotes originates from the limit-order book without direct participation by specialists, and that competition between traders and specialists has a significant impact on the bid--ask spread. Specialists' spreads are widest at the open, narrow until late morning, and then level off. The U-shaped intraday pattern of spreads largely reflects the intraday variation in spreads established by limit-order traders. Lastly, the intraday variation in limit-order spreads is significantly related to the intraday variation in limit-order placements and executions.

Dealer market structure, outside competition, and the bid--ask spread 
a Paul A Laux
a , Department of Banking and Finance, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-7235, USA
Received 1 November 1993; Accepted 1 April 1994
Abstract
We investigate the linkages between the number of dealers making markets in a security, the extent of outside (or nondealer) competition, and the market bid--ask spread for NASDAQ NMS stocks. The investigation is guided by a model that emphasizes dealers' interactions as their inventories change, and predicts that the extent of outside competition limits the bid--ask spread and the number of dealers. We hypothesize that the extent of outside market making capital in a stock is related to that stock's institutional holdings. Evidence shows that the extent of institutional holdings relative to trading volume proxies for outside competition. For stocks with little outside competition, the spread is large even though the number of dealers is also larger than for comparable stocks. The component of the spread related to outside market making capital is economically significant (about (1)/(2) to 1 percent of price). The composition of volume as to trade size and trade frequency, which is related to the level of institutional holdings, also influences the spread.

Hello Vince,

It was good to talk with you yesterday. David Rowe and I will be happy to
meet with you for breakfast at 7:00 on Tuesday. I will call on Monday to
set the location.

The URL for our commodity option calculator demonstration is

	http://perun.otci.net/Utility

Note that several of the data sets, which we obtain daily from NYMEX, are
incomplete. NG, HO, CN, NT and CL have enough data to indicate performance.
The others are either missing altogether or the series is too short to be
useful.

If you want to see the currency demonstration, it is at

	http://perun.otci.net/BC

and includes some technical material describing work we did in creating the
site.

With best regards,

Subject:	Boltzmann Model Demonstration from Toshiba in Tokyo
Importance:	High

Vince,

Enron Japan received a presentation today from a nuclear physicist working for Toshiba who has developed an application of the Boltzmann model to finance.  We were introduced to this group inside Toshiba through the Carlyle Group's Japan office.  Dr. Uenohara, from Toshiba, is travelling to New York City to speak at the 11th INFORMS Applied Probability Society Conference.  The URL is: http://www.cap.columbia.edu/informs-aps/ap-2001.html

Dr. Uenohara is interested in applying this model to power markets and would very much like to speak with someone from Enron during his trip to the US.  Is anyone from Enron going to be attending the conference?  If there is someone going, it would be worthwhile to facilitate a meeting.  If not, Dr. Uehara has stated he would travel to Houston between the dates of July 31 and August 4 to explain his model and the possibility of working with Enron.  Toshiba is currently working with Daiwa here in Japan, however they told us in the meeting that Daiwa was way too slow and they were looking for other companies to work with in the application of the model to different types of markets.  Please give me the name of a suitable contact in the event that we are able to arrange a visit for Dr. Uenohara to Houston.

Toshiba will be sending me the presentations we received today and I will forward them to you as soon as I receive them. 

Regards,
Mark Brady

Hi Vince -- I hope all is well and that you have recovered from the
flooding!

Just want to follow-up on a couple of things:

Firstly I haven't received your packet of information yet, which I'm looking
forward to reviewing.

Secondly, I just found out that a couple of our business guys may be coming
to your area.  So thought it may be interesting for them to meet up with
you.  Would you be interested/available?

Regards, Aruna

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

   Thank you very much for your effort to set up this conference.

   Since Zhiyong just had an accident yesterday, I am afraid it might not be a good time to talk to him at this moment
   about my transition ( I have not talked to Zhiyong yet, yesterday Zimin told me to go ahead and Zhiyong had the accident).
    Could we wait till he feels better ? 
   What do you think about ? Maybe I worry too much.

Subject:	VAR Engine question

Frank,

Concerning our ongoing discussions on the proper capture of ancillary and renewable energy credit positions in VAR, I have a proposed solution that I would like to run by you to ensure that proper valuation for these positions will be captured by your VAR engine.  As the positions are marked on their own curve but are valued for VAR purposes using the volatility curves and correlation factors for an energy curve, the VAR on these positions is obviously inaccurate.  As a result, the traders will be setting volatility curves and correlation factors today which will be unique for each ancillary/energy credit position.  All of the correlation factors will be zero and a majority of the volatility curves will be zero, as well.  I simply wanted to ensure that your model would not have a problem with volatilityies or correlations of zero.  I would appreciate your thoughts.

Thanks.
Casey

Are you guys still working on that ""project"" to provide content via EOL?
The reason I'm asking is we have developed a particular technology to
deliver fundamentals data via web-based applets, and we could probably
talk to the vendor about a larger license to permit its dissemination
this way. There would have to be disclaimers, and it might not work
because of the liability, but I did want to let you know we have a neat
technology to permit people to visualize data. Let me know if you want

Vince:

Greetings.

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was.

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public
Affairs Mike Rosen.

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26,
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or
whether you would prefer a subset thereof.

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy
Finance Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (Tel.:
512-232-7386) to coordinate matters.

Vince,

Thanks for your comments. I will adapt the memo to our clients to make it
more neutral.

I find myself in an interesting position -- you may recall meeting one of my
associates during one of our DC seminars that you attended. He is now
working for Larry Lindsay at the White House and I was with him on Friday.

He asked for my views on the situation and I demurred, saying I did not have
enough information to make an informed estimate of whether this might turn
into an energy equivalent of LTCM (the MG situation was quite different in
its structural aspects).

Anyway, I am trying to be helpful here... I realize your company can call DC
any time and present the situation but it may be useful to have someone like
me as a side channel.

If I can be useful in this channel let me know.

All the best.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs

Vince,

Thanks for your comments. I will adapt the memo to our clients to make it
more neutral.

I find myself in an interesting position -- you may recall meeting one of my
associates during one of our DC seminars that you attended. He is now
working for Larry Lindsay at the White House and I was with him on Friday.

He asked for my views on the situation and I demurred, saying I did not have
enough information to make an informed estimate of whether this might turn
into an energy equivalent of LTCM (the MG situation was quite different in
its structural aspects).

Anyway, I am trying to be helpful here... I realize your company can call DC
any time and present the situation but it may be useful to have someone like
me as a side channel.

If I can be useful in this channel let me know.

All the best.

Ed

I got your fax.

Thanks for your kind words about Enron. Every business

sleep over it.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs

You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this ""extra"" parameters.   We

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

Dear Mark and Vince
 
I know that it has been very trying for us all, but  I do believe that we have got there in the end! I have attached a copy of the  programme that I will send to the printers. Unless I hear from you  by tomorrow my time, I will ask the printer to proceed with the information  that I have.
 
We can discuss the exact specifics and logistics in  the near future. I will of course be in touch again and will send you both  copies of the brochure when it is printed. 
 
In the meantime, can I please have the following  information over the next few days (I know my demands are endless, but at least  they are no longer pressing!):
 
- a professional CV, around 70 to 100 words should  be fine
- your address
 
I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  look forward to working with you both on GARP 2002.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

"FW: Neptune -- merchant transmission","Kevin,

Please, take a look at the link to the website
describing the Neptune project (a merchant transmission
DC line from Canada and Maine to  NE). The link is embedded in one of the messages below.

The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.

Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard. 


Any interest?

Vince

Interestingly enough I have just spoken with Walter Coffer about an undersea project that Enron may be undertaking to take power from Canada to the New England area.  I'd like to talk with you about this when you have an opportunity.

Subject:	RE: Neptune -- merchant transmission

Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these
corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts
traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of
the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary
services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge
for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in
whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction.

We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the
summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an
anchor tenant concept).

As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow
in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll
keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual
challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do.

Hope things are going well in all of your markets!

Ed

Hi Iris

I would not include paper 8, as paper 7 supersedes it. Also how much rewriting of these papers do you envisage? Some of them are not up-to-date, or were written poorly and under time-pressure, so what do you envisage eventually sending to Duffie?

Department of Motor Vehicles

State departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) maintain a lot of personal information about you. (Just look at your driver's license, for example.) The Drivers Protection Act <http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2721.shtml> gives you privacy rights with regard to information maintained by DMVs. The law lists the ways this information can be used - a DMV may distribute personal information for things like law enforcement, driver safety, insurance underwriting, etc. 

A recent amendment to the law now prohibits a DMV from distributing your personal information for other types of uses, including for direct marketing, unless you give them permission.

Contact the DMV in your state for more information.

The Colloquium at 3:00 PM on Tuesday, Sept. 25 will be:

COLLOQUIUM TITLE
My Manhattan Project: A Physicist's
Adventures on Wall St
Nigel Goldenfeld
Department of Physics
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
1110 West Green St
Urbana
IL 61801
http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel

Abstract
Why is Wall St. one of the biggest
employers of physicists? What is the
quickest way to lose a billion dollars? How
might academic physicists gain
experience of real world applications? And
why bother? I discuss these and
other questions in light of my own
experience, starting a software company
to market ultra-fast tools for risk
management of derivative securities.







Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in ""Econophysics.""  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an ""Econophysics"" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).

Would you please launch an effort with the research group (not fundamentals) to build an options valuation model for the crude basket. Assume 100 MBD on average and 25 MBD of each class of crude. So we have the option of substituting any grade within the class of crudes. They may not have enough data to value them. Thanks.

Subject:	Crude Oil for Oz

As outlined in the Oz MOU, we will be supplying a basket of crudes at fixed differentials to WTI. To simplify the process of negotiating these diffs, we have established 4 classes of crude and picked a marker for each group. We need to come up with our offer for each of these markers (vs Calendar Nymex WTI) on a delivered basis. The crude classes and marker for each are as follows:

Class		Marker Crude

Light Sweet	Domestic Sweet
Heavy Sweet	Cabinda
Light Sour	Basrah Light
Heavy Sour	Maya

These were chosen based on an assumption that they are the most liquid grades for each class. We could probably use Mesa 30 instead of Bas Lt for the Lt Sour. Pat, if you want to do that just please call Quinn to make sure it works for him. Your call on what you think is the most liquid.

Once we have an offer for each of the markers, we will then set net diffs for all the other crudes by using a relative refining value of each grade relative to it's marker (and add the RV diff to the marker delivered diff). This will avoid us having to derive a forward market-based offer for each grade, using RRV instead. It will also establish diffs at which the refy will be indifferent on which grade is supplied. The preliminary list of approved crudes and their class are listed on the attached spreadsheet. (Please let me know if you want to add any crudes.)

I need your help with the following:

1) Work up an ""FOB"" offer for each grade on an 8 year basis, and assuming approximate size of 25MBD for each grade. It might be good to see if Jen's group can help with a fundamental angle on value for these grades (pls work through John if you want this as he has been asked to coordinate the Oz/Fraser connection).

2) We will work with you to structure net delivered numbers to the refinery. There are a number of costs that will need to get loaded into the bridge cost. Yolanda is verifying w/ops a lot of bridge costs that we got from Farmland. Pat or Don, please also feel free to look at the list (Yolanda has) and let us know if you have any comments. In add'n to those costs, we will need to add: a) backwardation between your FOB price basis and Cal Nymex, b) time value of money, c) linefill costs, d) tank rental costs (Fland rents breakout/blending tanks at Cush), e) Brent/WTI on Bas Lt and Cabinda, f) Freight (Joe - I am assuming you will make a market for the crude guys on the cargo movements - the WS rates on the attd sheet are out of date but you may find the template handy).


I NEED TO HAVE YOUR FOB OFFERS AND FREIGHT BY FIRST THING MONDAY PLEASE.

We will then circle up and work into the net number with you (let you check our spreadsheet for del'd costs).

I would have preferred to cover in person but will not be in in the AM.

Thanks!!

Rice asked me to teach another course on energy derivatives and I plan to use the 
book as the main source. You can inform them that they should keep the books in stock
and probably order a few more copies.

I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swamped

The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in  one night)

We've been in contact with Rice University's bookshop and they informed us  that they have a few books left over from the course.  We told them  originally that if they didn't sell them all we would take them back.  We  would rather have them sent over to you as complimentary copies if that's  OK with you?
 
What's new?  Busy summer so far?  Hope that the storm didn't  cause you any problems.
 
Julie

Just a reminder to let you know that I have still not received the following performance reviews from you:

Shirley

Vasant

If you have completed these reviews, please send them to me as soon as possible.  However, if you have not had a chance to sit down with these employees and discuss their performance and objectives for the next six months, please do so in the near future so that the employee will have ample opportunity to make the necessary adjustments and/ or complete their 6 month objectives.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  

Thanks in advance for your help

Vince, 

Here is my thoughts on the upcoming reorg.  In my mind,
it seems logical to create a team specialized in EWS trading/origination
support.  

I would suggest Vasant to oversee EBS support.  Where do you
want to put  the power fundamental team ?  Vasant has more 
experience to manage this team although they can be also classified
as trading support.  In term of head counts, I am inclined to let Vasant
supervise this team.

Vince,

I thought you might just like to have this information: several people have been asking about our trading volumes and whether or not they have decreased significantly. According to the graphs in the attached spreadsheet, the only significant drop in EOL trading came on 09/11 and 09/12. In fact, the largest number of transactions on EOL was on 10/23, which is since many of our problems started.

I have to add another item to a long list of your headaches.

Greg Whalley gave us marching orders to treat the development of quantitative
models for data mining of EOL trade records as the top priority.
I shall be providing Greg bi-weekly updates on the project. 

FYI only. I am flying with Greg next week to a meeting with a third party
that may be involved in some aspects of this project. I shall tell you more when
we meet.

I know that we, as well as Greg, can count on full support and cooperation from you.

I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, to set up a meeting with you next week after I come back from
the trip.

      Opt4 is currently interviewing for two software engineering
   positions.
      Our
      needs currently center on Java and integrating Java with Oracle,
      WebLogic,
      and XML.  Your son looks like he may have background in those
   specific
      frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration
   needs
      in a
      few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new
      interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job
   descriptions
      and
      forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in
      Mathematica
      (for the time being), but we have a full team.  If you son's work
   took
      him
      into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in
   his
      ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who
   know
      how
      to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system
   designers
      at
      IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro
      hard
      drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to
      him.

Friends:

Tomorrow will be my last day at Enron.  However, I will be near, as I will be taking a new position at El Paso in a few weeks.

I've enjoyed getting to know and work with you during my stay here.

I wish you all the greatest success.

Shawn

P.S.  Prior to getting new contact information, I can be reached at shawnfwd@hotmail.com or on my cell (713.851.9578).

Subject:	invitations to presentation only

Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

""Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh"" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, ""Ivy Ghose"" <ghosei@rice.edu>, ""Luigi Calabrese"" <luigical@rice.edu>, ""Pravas Sud"" <pravas@rice.edu>, ""Syed \(Farhan\) Iqbal"" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

ken

"RE: The first document for audit","Hello Darrell,

Many changes in Enron kept me busy during  the last few days.

Rabi and Tanya are working on a new version of the documentation
and we hope to send it to you in a few days.

I agree with you that the document we sent you was rather cryptic
and apologize for not screening it more effectively.
I agree with you regarding point # 2 and so does Tanya. I think
she did not explain precisely what she meant by her comment.

I hope to talk to you soon.

Vince


P.S. We still owe you money for work done over the last 18 months.

Subject:	Re: The first document for audit

Vince:

I read the relibaility-based VAR method document with interest.

Here are some comments:

1. The document falls short of describing how
to use the method in practice, but rather
gives some general motivation. I am confident
that I myself could not develop an algorithm
based on this document, unless all of the
derivative valuation functions are explicit
(and rather nice) functions
with explicit derivatives of the underlying variables, in which case
the VAR problem is not so hard in any case,
as Monte Carlo is very effective in this case.
(My comment here is critical of exposition.
I do not suggest that the proposed method
is weak!)

2. The remark (p. 2) that my paper with Jun Pan
addresses only normal returns is not
correct. The main point of our paper was to allow
for jumps, including fat tails and skewness.
The comment that we rely on delta-gamma
is a good criticism,and the main potential
advantage of the reliability approach,
if it works in practical cases.

3. There is a typo at page 2, at 9 lines from
the bottom, where I presume g(T(u)), not g(T(x))

4. There is a missing `we' on page 5, 9 lines
from the bottom.

5. The remark on CPU time (page 7) does
not mention what machine was used.

6. The example (page 8) does
not really have much non-normality. Skewness=0,
and kurtosis (4) (is this excess kurtosis?)
are not much compared to most practical cases, in which kurtosis
is an extra order of magnitude, with lots
of skewness.


Overall, the paper piqued my curiosity a lot,
and left me wanting more clarity,
and a cookbook.


I hope `events' at Enron have not made things
difficult for you.

I will later bill you for one hour, if that is OK.


Warmest personal regards, Darrell

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

Subject:	Neptune

Dear Vince,

As you may know, FERC approved the Neptune transmission proposal on July 26
and the organizers (me among them) are now preparing to hold on open season
starting September 10 to sell 80 percent of the capacity on a firm basis. A
diagram of the system legs is on www.NeptuneRTS.com.

Some of the bidders in that open season will be gencos with little or no
experience in trading, some will be load-serving entities, some will be
power marketers.

There is likely to be interest in a Neptune hedge, and I wondered how we
could engage Enron in an exploration of its willingness to provide such
hedges. Essentially, bidders will be going long the various spreads (Nova
Scotia - New York, New Brunswick - Boston, PSE&G - Zone J, etc etc) and we
would like to encourage someone like Enron (I know there is no one quite
like Enron but you know what I mean) to be willing to offer transmission
hedges.

It may also interest you that FERC gave Neptune approval to hold 20 percent
of the capacity for sale in the short-term markets. We (the development
group) see that as a desirable exposure to these spreads for Neptune's
equity investors and are in the equity markets now securing a second tranche
of development capital, and will return in early 2002 for a sizeable amount
of permanent equity assuming the bids received in September - October yield
sufficient interest to finance the majority of the project in the debt
market.

That's the plan, the primary virtue of which is that the authorities have
allowed us to put it to a market test this fall. Let me know if you'd like
to pursue this. I will make similar initiatives to several other entities
later this week.

Vince,

As per our conversation yesterday I would very much appreciate it if you could help me with this matter.  I was under the impression that I would be promoted to Associate this August, which according to my pay stub and eHRonline hasn't occurred.  According to the A/A rules, a copy of which I am attaching below, an Analyst can be promoted to Associate if he/she falls under one of the criteria among several.  The one I believe I am eligible under states:

-  completed 2 years in the Program; have a performance rating of Excellent or above; and have either (1) an appropriate graduate degree or (2)  1 year of relevant commercial work experience prior to Enron

Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to look into this issue.  Thank you very much for your time and help.

Vince,

Great to talk with you this morning and hear that you are well (if not
connected).  Here's my suggestion for ""setting my work platform on fire"".
On July 27th I am teaching in the Dallas Executive MBA program.  John
McCormack (Stern-Stewart, NY) is going to come down to help out with the
class and I would like you to come as well.  If you would like to come in
on Thursday evening then you, John, and I can meet and work on a joint
project.  What I have in mind, generally, is delving more deeply into the
actual use of real options in creating synthetic multi-fuel power plants.
I have a paper that I assign the class which introduces real options as an
attribute of the physical power plant that can switch from oil to gas.
When I was writing our paper I read one of your papers that suggested the
use of energy swaps to accomplish the same end in a synthetic manner.  I
would like to ""learn more"" about how this might actually be done
(costs/benefits, etc) and write-up a case study surrounding a specific
application.  I know this is not rocket science to you but I believe there
is value in ""translating practice and science to application in the form of
educational materials"".  My standard of ""what's valuable"" relies on my own
ignorance here.  I figure that if I don't know it then there are a lot of
folks in the profession that might benefit from my learning.  Both you and
John are very knowledgeable here so I will again sit at the feet of the
masters.

That's the project, now let's talk about the class.  The idea of the class
is to let John do some Stern-Stewart stuff (performance measurement and
compensation) and let you talk about how Enron uses energy derivatives to
facilitate trade in the energy business.  I'm sure we will have had some
brownouts in California by the time of the class will be very interested in
the energy business and the way that Enron has redefined it.

Hope you can make it.

John

I wanted to let you know that I received  Jill's resume ( via Molly Magee & Anne Labbe) and added her  to the Executive Referral program. 

I called Jill to let her know I received her resume and have forwarded it on to another recruiter for review.

I will keep you up to date on her status when I receive feedback from the recruiter. Please feel free to call me with any questions or specific people you wish to see her resume.

	Dear Dr. Kamiski,


        I am a student of the master in Quantitative Computational Finance
in Georgia Tech and also a Ph.D. student of the school of Mathematics. I
had the opportunity of attending the talk you gave in Georgia Tech two
weeks ago. I found the field and your work extremely interesting and
exciting. Since I am finishing the master degree in QCF this Fall and I
am in the initial  stages of my dissertation research, I am really looking
forward to having exposure to some real problems that the industry has
related to price modeling and pricing of financial instruments. I believe
that such a exposure will serve to motivate my dissertation and research.

        I firmly believe that my mathematical background is particularly
suitable for the problems you explained in your talks. I have another
master degree in Statistics and probability, in which I had exposure to
practical and theoretical aspects of statistics and probability. As part
of my master dissertation, I had the opportunity to study in depth
Self-similar Stochastic Processes and Levy Processes with particular
emphasis on papers of Taqqu, Samorodnitsky, Sato, Mandelbrot, and
Bandorff-Nielsen. Also, I have extensive experience in C and Java
programming as well as standard statistical and mathematical packages like
MatLab, Maple, S-plus, Minitab, and Statgraphics. You can read my
resume attached to the e-mail.

        I am really interested in working on an internship next Spring
and/or Summer in your group or maybe to work individually with you in
reading sections and research projects related to the energetic field.

	One last thing, I wonder if you can provide me with a copy of your
slices or some bibliography.

	Thanks for your time and I expect to hear from you.

	Sincerely yours,

	Jose E. Figueroa-Lopez

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!

You and I met last year when I had to opportunity to sit in your Energy
Derivatives class.

I work with Wil Uecker and have been trying to expand our executive
education programs for energy companies. The area that seems to have to most
interest is trading and risk management. There seems to be a market, some of
the faculty is working in this area, and it would leverage the facilities in
the new building.

We are in the very early stages of thinking about this and would welcome
your input and involvement. I have proposed that we design a fairly
comprehensive program to cover the essential competencies which
professionals in these areas master. The design should have input from both
academics and practitioners. Once we have some outline of the content, we
can address delivery options.

This is obviously vague, but I believe that it has the potential to be of
significance for the Jones School. I am also aware that other schools are
working on similar concepts. Please let me know if you have any interest in
this initiative. I would welcome your ideas and the chance to meet with you.

Vince,

I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating
in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in
quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is
deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward
to your visit.

On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on
our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership
(http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation
from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in
expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!

The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York.
Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enron's participation
on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program
to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a ""first
look"" at the ""MSCF Resume Book.""  From our standpoint, your experience and
counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and
opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.

Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan.
Would you be willing join us?

Sarah,

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

Subject:	SEC depostion

Bob,

I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before
the Commission. I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general 
advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement
of expenses. 

My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer. My only regret is that I shall not be given
an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience. 

You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my
right to a counsel.  This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person. 

I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.

I'd love to get together again soon.

Dan Reck and I were discussing various markets, and he suggested that I contact you about a question that I raised.

I was trying to find out what share of the eventual total cost of the net/net endusers' market of any liquid commodity should optimally be represented by the various intermediaries (risk management providers; repackagers; consolidators; knowledge based intermediaries/service providers; otherwise).

If I can invite you to lunch, that's great.  Otherwise, if you can spare 15 minutes, I greatly appreciate it.

Thanks

Thanks for your words of comfort. The higher you fly, the harder you crash.
Books will be written about this company.

I don't worry too much about myself. I have about fifty employees in
Houston and 10 in London who need help. I am trying to find jobs
for them using my contacts in the industry. 

Personally, I have many options that have come up in the last few days but everything is
on hold for the time being till uncertainty is resolved here  at Enron.

Dear Vince: hope this reaches you. Just wanted to say how sorry I am about
what's happened to Enron. I hope things work out for you -- I'm sure with
all your brilliance they will. But it's so hard to believe that a company as
revered as Enron can unwind in such a short space of time. It makes you
re-think a lot of assumptions about how companies run and how markets work.

Enron is big news over here. On the main BBC t.v. news last night, Enron was
the third story, after Afghanistan and the memorial service at Westminster
Abbey for the British killed on Sept 11 (which a lot of us attended with the
Bristow, Bennett and other families).

Anyway, please keep in touch.

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/

I think our participation may a bit higher.

Subject:	Data Mining Course

Vince,

In the light of our discussion this morning about EOL, I have investigated the possibility of taking a two-day Data Mining Course. I believe this would considerably help in coming up with ideas about how to analyse the EOL database, as well as providing some initial experience in the use of data mining tools and techniques. I found several possible courses that could prove valuable in this regard, and some of these are listed below. The first of these was recommended by Eric (Cope), and is the earliest of the courses that I could find, so I will plan on registering for it unless there is good reason not to.

1. ""STATISTICAL LEARNING AND DATA MINING: from Supervised to Unsupervised Learning"" - Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (both of Stanford Univeristy); to be held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Sept. 6-7, 2001; Cost = $1,250. (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/MRC/mrc.general.html)
2. ""How to Successfully Mine Data"" - Dr. Richard De Veaux and Herbert Edelstein (Two Crows Corporation); to be held in Bethesda, Maryland, October 8-9, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.twocrows.com/dmcourse.htm)
3. ""Statistical Data Mining"" - Dr. Brian D. Ripley (University of Oxford, sponsored by Insightful); to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 15-16, 2001; Cost = $1,800. (http://www.insightful.com/train/ripley.htm)
4. ""Tools for Discovering Patterns in Data: A Survey of Modern Data Mining Algorithms"" - John Elder (of Elder Research); to be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, October 16-17, 2001; Cost = $1,195. (http://www.datamininglab.com/newcourse.html)
5. ""DATA MINING: LEVEL I - An intensive introduction to methods, applications and resources"" - Tony Rathburn (The Modeling Agency); to be held in Dallas, Texas, November 27-28, 2001; Cost = $1,095. (http://www.the-modeling-agency.com/training/dm1.htm)

TheMarket for Lemons and the Price of Dishonesty 
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded thisyear to three economists: George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz and Michael Spence,who made significant contributions to modeling markets with information asymmetry.In many cases in a given market sellers or buyers may have exclusiveinformation that is not available to the counter party. The best-known examplecomes from the [paper by Akerlof, The Market for ""Lemons"": QualityUncertainty and the Market Mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84,(1970), pages 488-500.  
An owner of a used car can form a good idea of the qualityof his vehicle. He has much better information if his car is a lemon. As bothgood and bad used car have to sell at the same price - it is impossible for anaverage buyer to distinguish between good and bad merchandise - they sellers ofgood used cars are driven out of the market. Most traded used cars will belemons. Of course, there are ways to mitigate the problem: an owner of a goodused car may send signal to the buyer by offering him a guarantee or absorbingthe cost of inspection. 
Hiring is a similardecision. As Michael Spence wrote in his paper Job Market Signaling,Quarterly Journal of Economics, 87, (1973), pages 355 - 374, to hire somebodyis frequently to purchase a lottery ticket. The employer cannot directlyobserve the productivity of a potential hire. ""What he does observe is aplethora of personal data in the form of observable characteristics andattributes of the individual, and it is these that must ultimately determinehis assessment of the lottery he is buying."" The observable characteristics of an individual may be immutable (raceand, generally, sex) but in some cases certain attributes are alterable. A candidatecan modify such characteristics as education and job history. Some economistssay, tongue-in-cheek, that some candidates who attended top schools and spentmany painful hours studying useless subjects signal their willingness to dowhatever it takes to succeed. Another way to send a signal about one's qualityis to find a job with a top firm at the beginning of one's career and tosucceed in this firm before moving on. This provides a useful lesson to anybodywho plans to be in the labor market at some points in his or her life: thereputation of the current employer is critical to future employmentopportunities and should be defended at any cost. Honesty, at the end of theday, is an imperative dictated as much by morality as by one's self interest.

Another JCC possibility as well.  

I don't know if you have looked too closely at the MS price sheet that I sent over the other day, but we calculate, based on Enron's curves, that they are earning upwards of USD .50/bbl.  Clearly the effects of little competition.

I gave you local admin rights on your laptop yesterday. What you have to do is to log into the laptop using the local

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

Hi Vincent:
 
Super Saturday is coming and I am so happy to move toward the end of the recruiting process.  During the interviews that I have had so far, I expressed my desire to have my first rotation in your group.  Last spring I really enjoyed the work environment and the people I met.  I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.
 
On another note, Jason gave me two names for the Energy Club.  I will contact them shortly after finals next week.
 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you again.

Hi, Vince
I hope everything is fine with you. I am following the news and issues about Enron. This has not in anyway change my resolve in working for the company. I am sure the Chairman will stir the company into the right direction. 
I mentioned to you that I was interviewed two weeks ago by Andy Lewis of the trading group. It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that I and Andy took. Andy reinforced what I read in the Trading Naural Gas book by Fletcher Sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate. More than anything else, it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. He mentioned, however, that he initially found me overqualified. I assured him, nonetheless, that I am committed to the task at hand. 
The following day, my uncle received a call from someone at Enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university. I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as Andy mentioned previously. I left two voice messages at Andy's home and office number. I have yet to receive the second call.
I am very much interested in pursuing the application. I will write a separate e-mail to Todd Peikert of HR to check on the status of the program. Just wanted to let you know.
Sincerely,
Yvan

"RE: Would anyone be interested?....","Brian,

Another interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place.

As you know, Brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage. About
95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of
water in the reservoirs  is about 20% of the normal. We have a huge
exposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.

Measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil 
are asking for help. We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting
technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections. These
objections may not apply to Brazil.

Can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and Remy Collonge from
Sao Paulo to discuss the problem? He will be  back in his office on Tuesday .

I shall call you tomorrow about it. What is your phone number?

Vince - 

Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group.  Right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year.  Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer.  What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis, who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer. 

When we start the summer process, we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group.

Is this okay with you?

Hope all is well  with you

One of the students indicated that he is
interested in a summer internship.
He came across as a very bright person,
very personable.

I can take him as a summer intern.

Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski,

Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
Thank you for your time.

I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.
However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those
attachments are what I was asked. Again, it was a good chance for me to
get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on
in school.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
Thank you.

Vince,

Thanx for the quick response.  

I really want to provide Jose the opportunity to be heard and discuss theory more than specific details.  A lunch or breakfast informal meeting would suffice.  

If your Karma continues to work, we may start strategically place you on 32 for AGA days or I may keep you for customer negotiations in 4th quarter.

Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.

Hi Lance,

	he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then interview him.

"Re: EPRM 2001 Houston","Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on

It seems that Risk are getting out of the book publishing business to concentrate on their journals.  I have established contact with the senior commissioning editor for Wiley, who is interested in working with us to publish something like our joint Risk publication (Managing Energy Price Risk), as well as a similar title on metals.

I'm due to go on holiday from tomorrow for a couple of weeks.  Would you be interested in following up with her, or should I continue when I return from my break?
(Vince - Something you may not be aware of is that I'm moving over to trade oil derivatives when I return from my holiday for Niamh Clarke/John Nowlan.)

Given that I'm getting out of the metals business it would be appropriate for someone else to pick up the metals price risk book proposal, though I am happy to continue with it if Joe wishes.

Dear Steve

It was a pleasure meeting up with you again last week.  I enjoyed our
meeting and found it most informative - thanks for the tour of the various
trading floors.

As discussed, I would be most interested in pursuing a book on metals
trading, and more broadly, various books on the quantitative aspects of
energy trading (& related commodities). Wiley is renowned for the depth and
breadth of its finance publishing and, in particular, well-respected for
the more quantitative part of our finance list.  Such titles include
Rebonato's 'Interest Rate Option Models'; Willmott's 'Paul Willmott on
Quantitative Finance'; Taleb 'Dynamic Hedging'; Saunders 'Credit Risk
Measurement'; James/Webber 'Interest Rate Modelling'; Caouette et al
'Managing Credit Risk'; Carol Alexander's 'Risk Management' and so on.
One area that we are interesting in publishing in is in the area of energy,
in its broadest sense.  Enron is obviously a key player in this market, and
we would certainly welcome exploring various options in terms of publishing
books with Enron, Enron employees or as part of a collaboration with
various industry players.

Wiley is a publisher with an international reputation.  Within finance we
commission product from the US, Europe and Asia, under the Wiley Finance
umbrella.  A key part of our publishing strategy is to present our titles
as a seamless whole, with global sales, marketing and distribution.  Our
various sales channels include teams dedicated to servicing the needs of
the booktrade; online accounts; corporates; libraries, universities and the
increasing number of e-content providers (e.g. NetLibrary; Fat Brain etc.)

Topics of interest that initially spring to mind include:
   Managing Metals Price Risk
   Managing Energy Price Risk
   Weather Risk Management
   Books on trading, risk management etc. for specific commodities
   (broadband; electricity, natural gas, oil etc.)

When we met you discussed the possibility of putting together a book
proposal on metals, with your team at Enron.  I very much hope that you
decide to pursue this further.  For your information, I have attached our
standard new book proposal form below, as a guideline.  Finally, you also
planned on speaking with Vince Kaminski about other publishing
opportunities and book ideas.  I would be more than happy to follow up with
Vince myself if you thought this appropriate.

Once again, thanks for your time last Thursday. I very much look forward to
hearing from you.

All best wishes

"VaR","David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

I have to say sorry for disturbing your valuable time but I really need your

My name is Visit Phunnarungsi. I am now taking Master of Banking & Finance
at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia.

In this last semester, I am writing the thesis about the electricity
derivatives and found that you are very expert in this area. I found your
name in the article: The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity
Derivatives"" The US Power Market, 149-171. Risk Publications (1997)

However, I could not found the Risk Publications (1997) available in the
library of Australia University.  There is only 1995 publications.

It would be appreciated if you are possible sending it to me electronically
as I would like to do theoretically review of this article for my thesis. Or
please advice any source that I can found this article.

Thank you very much.

Summer is quickly drawing to a close for our summer interns.  

We have scheduled several departure dates for the interns.  Our records indicate that your summer intern, Kyriakos L. Frantzeskakis, is scheduled to return to school on 8/10/01.  

We would like to host a performance review session for all interns who are departing during this same week.  

The review session for your intern will be held on August 2nd at 10:00 am to 11:30 am in EB 35C2.  Please bring the completed performance feedback form for your intern to this meeting along with any other feedback from your team members that you may have collected. 

We will discuss each intern, cross calibrate their individual performances and decide which interns will receive full time offers.

If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me at X33242.

Sincerely,

Nelson,

I know you are focusing on agricultural products for trading, so I just wanted to know if we are looking at Wool.  I know that it's traded in Australia and New Zealand, so we might be able to look into it as well.  Please let me know.  Thank you.

Seksan,

Attached is a paper describing my algorithm for calculating expected hourly dispatch from monthly on-peak power, off-peak power, and gas prices, and their associated volatilities and covariance.  I have been promising this to folks for awhile now, so your request spurred me to action.

I will send later a copy of Lydia, our workbook program for distributing hourly prices from scalars, consistent with on- and off-peak monthly prices, and recognizing about 70+ reasonability constraints.  It is actually an exhaustive search optimization program.  The disversity in hourly prices is optimized.  I understand this is not something you are immediately interested in, so there is no particular urgency to get it to you.  (I need to update the documentation a bit.)

Incidently, you need to have Microsoft Equation Editor 3.0 installed in Word to properly read this document.  I believe it is part of the standard Office 97 install, so there shouldn't be any problem.  Nevertheless, if you run into problems viewing the document, take a look at your Word references.

Hope this is useful,
Michael

>>> Kiatsupaibul, Seksan 07/23/01 11:48AM >>>
Dear Michael:

Houston, we have some problems.  I am a research member, working with Krishna and Osman supporting EES.  Now we have some projects about load curtailment options.  They would like to have volatility for power price on the hourly basis.  Attending the meeting last Thursday, we heard that you have written up about the methodology how to build such an hourly volatility.  Osman let me contact you requesting for the model.  I would appreciate if you can provide me one.  By the way, if this is not the Michael, sorry to bother you.

Best regards,
Seksan.

Iris had asked if it was possible to get a room in London with a kitchenette so she could make some of her own meals since she is vegetarian .  The Anetheum has apartments with kitchens but they cost a $100 a day more than the regular room.   Should I just give her a regular room?    Sorry to bother you with all of this, but I don't know the appropriate thing to do in this case.

Subject:	Valuation Methodology

We've had a request from AA to provide them with some sort of write-up or documentation from our research group on the valuation methodology used on the contingent issuance instrument for 18 million shares that was a part of the Raptor transaction completed at the end of March.  Apparently, this request has come from AA's expert in this area (I believe that his name is Dechundra, or something like that.  I've probably destroyed the spelling on that.  You guys are probably very familiar with him.)  Anyway, is there such documentation that we can provide them easily?  If so, let me know so that we can try to get AA finished with their review of the transaction.  In talking to our contacts at AA, I believe that their expert will be wanting to talk to you after he reviews the methodology documentation.  Thanks,
Ron

What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.

We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 

Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for
a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer,
Mark Taylor, as well.

Energy Committee Members
I wanted to fix the date on your calendar for the next Energy Committee
meeting.  From the feedback received, the best date turned out to be January
23, 2001 although not everyone could make that. The 5:00 to 7:00 PM period
seemed to work ok last time so we would try this again on January 23, 2001.
Please mark your calendars accordingly.  We would hope to be getting your
feedback soon on the specific questions sent out to each of the sub-groups.
Let us know if you have not received these attachements.  Relative to the
next meeting agenda, the current thought is as follows:
                          Education sub group discussion output
30 minutes
                          Seminars/ Forums/etc sub group discussion      30
minutes
                          Energy Trading Center sub group discussion      30
minutes
                          Marketing GEMI
         30 minutes
Would appreciate hearing your thoughts of potential additional agenda items,
and any initial thoughts you might have on marketing.
Happy Holidays,

Please take just a few minutes to read the following message and then forward to others in your group.
 
Once again Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) walk.  This year the walk will be held on Sunday, October 28, 2001, at Greenspoint Mall.
 
As some of you may know, Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that is very important to him.  There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Type 1, insulin-dependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes.  The other type of diabetes is Type 2, adult-onset diabetes that can often be controlled with a combination of diet, exercise and oral medication.  Every day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least 7 times, in addition to giving himself at least 3 or 4 injections of insulin.  Just think of it, at least 10 times a day Mike has to stick himself with a needle to manage his disease.  I don't know about you, but I am a wimp if I have to get a shot just once every few years and I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like to stick yourself over 70 times in just one week!  But for Mike it is not just one day or one week, it is every day of every week for the rest of his life -- until a cure is found.  Diabetics can never take a break from their disease.  It requires constant management of their food intake, monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the proper amount of insulin.  If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead to kidney disease or failure, blindness, heart disease, amputations, among other complications.
 
I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his efforts with the JDRF walk again this year.  I am serving on the steering committee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure for this terrible disease.  I am doing this to support Mike, but I also have a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure.  My husband has adult-onset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to diabetes and diabetes-related diseases several years ago.  In addition, I have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes.
 
I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk this year.  It would mean a lot to me (and to Mike) to have support from the people in our Enron Global Markets organization, as well as people from previous groups we have worked with, along with other friends throughout Enron.
 
Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to take this opportunity to say thank you very much!  For those of you that have not yet signed up, please consider one of the following three opportunities that are available to give your support to this important effort:
1.      Team Leader.  The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the collecting and reporting of funds raised by their group of walkers.  Based on the donations raised by your group, you may also be eligible for prizes available only to team leaders.  If you are interested in becoming a team leader, please contact me right away so that I may get the team leader information and materials to you. 
2.      Walkers.  If you want to sign up to walk and raise funds for JDRF, I will make sure that you get on one of our teams -- just sign up!  The JDRF walk is a very fun event with music, entertainment and great food.  All walkers are asked to raise at least $25 in donations and will receive a great T-shirt to wear the day of the walk. 
3.      Supporters.  If it just is not possible for you to join us for the walk on October 28th, then please sign up as a supporter by sending a return e-mail with your pledge amount and you will be contacted later in October for collection of the donation. 
The bottom line is raising money to support research to find a cure!  The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is very well managed and for every dollar that is donated to JDRF, over 85 cents goes directly to research.  In addition, this year Enron will match all donations dollar for dollar.
 
Thank you for your support, time and efforts.  And please, let's Walk to Cure Diabetes!

If the schedule works, perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course, given the number of us going.  Vasant has offered to drive.  Dependiing on driving speed and traffic, leaving Houston by 9:30am should give sufficient time to make the 1pm class, including some time for lunch.

Please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate plans or suggestions.

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

Vince, I will certainly try. I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh. Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not. The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no. Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse.

But I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai. 

Wade

Subject:	Help for Krishnarao Pinnamaneni

Wade,

I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who
faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna
from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.

A brief outline of the facts.

1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years
ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival
was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy
is also very complicated.

2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a 
tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the
term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with
the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.

The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an 
outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American 
society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his 
behalf to the State Department.

I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational
approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.

I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's
behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. 
I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.

Thanks.

Vince

Dear all,

We have developed analytical soulutions for weather-triggered commodity options.
We have also programmed those formulas into user-friendly Excel functions.

The original request came from the weather derivatives structuring desk, but the
model can be used in other situations --- generically it is a double trigger option deal.

See the documentation for more details.

Vince,

My phone is (650) 725-0541 (office).

I am still in a state of shock about Enron and I am still absorbing all the
news I can.  It is almost unbelievable to me that the company I worked for
this summer is now essentially kaput.

From the website I contacted you from, I take it that you are no longer with
Enron.  Please accept my deepest sympathies and best wishes in what must
surely be a difficult time.  I hope you were not as heavily invested in Enron
as many employees seemed to be.

I wanted to contact you regarding letters of recommendation.  I'm currently
looking for summer employment, in particular at network providers (such as
AT&T and IBM) as well as some financial institutions.  Would it be any
trouble for you to write a note on my behalf?  They may be requested via
email, so an actual letter may not be necessary.  I would have more details
later.

My best to you and your family and all those I knew this summer ---

Eric

I want to thank you along with Dean Warga, Bob Casey, and Dr. Praveen Kumar
for an engaging and successful inaugural meeting of the Energy Committee.
From our perspective, we achieved the key input and decisions desired of you.
 We hope that you saw the meeting as worthwhile and that it met your needs as
well. Any feedback that you have for me would be most appreciated.

I want to highlight the key outcomes and ask for your quick response on any
concerns.  First, the name which received the greatest endorsement and
therefore our choice was the Global Energy Management Institute, which as an
accronym would shorten to GEMI.  As discussed, the full name would actually
be the University of Houston's Global Energy Management Institute at the
Bauer College of Business.  Obviously, most references would be the Global
Energy Management Institute or GEMI.

Second, there was very valuable input and support on the concept of a
""partnership"" having four fee based levels ($100k, $50k, $25k, and $5k).  We
will work at a first draft proposal of value received for those four levels
and send to you next week.  As suggested, we will not have an entrance fee
and we will think about some discounts or offsets with perhaps a minimum
amount not offsetable. Another suggestion was to call the levels something
which related to Energy.  We would offer up the Wood Level at $5k, the Coal
Level at $25K,  the Oil&Gas Level at $50k, and Nuclear at $100k.  Look for
your feedback here.

Attached is the outcome of the sub group selection.  We are thoroughly
delighted that your participation is very balanced which should strenghten
the overall results.  Hopefully next week we will be sending out separate
e-mails to the three sub groups seeking your detailed input.

I mentioned that we would like to schedule the next meeting of the Energy
Committee in January.  Please look at your calendars and let me know your
availability for the following dates:  Jan 10, Jan 15, Jan 23 and Jan 24.  We
will chose the one that the most members can attend.   As noted, the agenda
for that meeting for our discussion will be the sub group results plus an
important dialogue on Marketing (including alliances).

Again, thanks so much for your participation

Lane

If Greg can get a co plane to go San Francisco on Thursday, we could  fly together to Santa Fe

ABSTRACT:
 Fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a
 measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk,
 are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve
 discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in
 applications because of the prevalence of models based on
 scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able
 to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is
 coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through
 linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale
 calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical
 efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several
 case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index
 tracking.

 Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean
 shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios,
 hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management

Vince,

I hope your day is going well.  We seem to have temporarily run out of new people to feature.  Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  I think that in the future, I would like to feature Tanya's daughter Sofya, and also perhaps see if we can cover some people in our offices overseas.  If they can produce the photographs over there, it should be workable. 

Until then, would you like to contribute?

Thank You!

Hello!
 
Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow all   presentations are due as I will be in and out of the office for the rest of the  week at the Asset and Liability Management conference.  
 
If your presentations are not ready, for whatever  reason, please send me an email to notify me and I will send you a headcount as  to how many copies of your presentations to print.  You will need to take  them to the training course yourself.  
 
Please remember that you will need to bring your  own laptops as we do not provide them.  Spyros, I believe you are to  inquire with Peter to see if you can use his.  
 
Also, I am under the impression that the  presentations submitted for the London training course, will be the same ones to  be used in the New York and Houston Financial Mathematics training  courses.  Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know by when you will  have presentations ready for those particular courses in those  locations.
 
Should you have any questions or comments, please  feel free to contact me.
 
All the best and I look forward to meeting you  soon.

Thank you for you efforts on this. As I've told Cindy, we really need you to send it to us this evening (Houston time), so that we can put it into the model tomorrow morning (UK time). Could you please copy in Joyon Manning and Suryan Wirya Simunovic when you send it.

                                            28 November 2001

                Have Soviet-era bio-weapons infected Afghan
                refugees?

                Ominous news from Pakistan and Iran indicate that at best a viral
                pandemic may be brewing among Afghan refugees, at worst that
                former Soviet biological weapons have possibly made their first
                appearance. 

                In Pakistan, at least 75 people have been diagnosed in Quetta,
                capital of Baluchistan province, with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
                fever in the largest outbreak of the disease ever recorded. Eight
                have already died. All the infected are refugees recently arrived
                from Afghanistan or people living close to the border. An isolation
                ward surrounded by barbed wire has been established at the Fatima
                Jinnah chest and general hospital in Quetta. 

                Ali-Safar Makaanali, head of Iran's Border Quarantines, has
                confirmed that Iranian health officials are also dealing with an
                outbreak of the virus, with more than 100 citizens having been
                infected. Iranian health authorities have established 40 quarantine
                bases on the border in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease.
                In addition, more than 100 mobile quarantine bases have been set
                up, and 39 hospitals have been prepared to cope with patients. As
                the traditional infection vector are ticks and as refugees would
                undoubtedly bring their livestock with them, the possibility of a
                pandemic looms large, especially if the current campaign causes a
                flood of refugees.

                The virus has a mortality rate of over 50 per cent, damaging
                arteries, veins and other blood vessels before leading to the
                collapse of major organs, eventually causing its victim to die of
                internal bleeding. The disease is highly infectious and can be
                transmitted via contact with infected individuals. 

                Soviet biological arsenal at large

                What makes the viral outbreak menacing is the knowledge that in
                the 1980s the USSR's biological warfare research organisation
                Biopreparat intensively studied biological weapons and maintained
                a bank of 10,000 of the most dangerous and exotic viruses known,
                including smallpox, Ebola and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.
                Many intelligence analysts believe that Osama bin Laden acquired
                biological weapons agents from Kazakh arms dealers.

                Therefore, it begs the question: Are the Iranian and Pakistani
                outbreaks an unfortunate coincidence or something more sinister?

Dear Vince and Christie,

 

I hope that you are both well, and are ready for the onset of summer in Houston!  I was disappointed that I was not able to see you at the final Tiger Team presentations last month due to a family emergency.  I hope that the teams' analyses will be helpful to your work, and echo their appreciation of your involvement and support.

 

I am writing with a question regarding recruiting for Enron's weather risk management group.  My boyfriend, Greg Hunt, is currently seeking opportunities to combine his background in meteorology (MS and 2 years of research at Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab) and an MBA in finance and information technology.  I began thinking about Enron's work in weather derivatives, and realized that there could possibly be a great fit there.

 

I have copied Greg on this message, and would appreciate any suggestions you can offer regarding opportunities in this group.  Thank you very much!

 

Best regards,

 

Heather

The East Power Fundamentals group has asked that we give a transmission primer for the analysts in their group.  Lance and I have accepted and will be presenting two talks.  I think the same material might be useful for the Research Group at large (perhaps via Thursday staff meetings or Friday brownbags) and/or a few technical corner articles.  Topics would include a glossary of terms/jargon/acronyms, basic concepts (voltage, real and reactive power, transfer limits, loop flow), structure of the network (NERC regions, major hubs, etc), and congestion issues (TLR and FTR/TCC, examples of traditional bottlenecks).  If done in a series, we could also solicit questions for explanation at a subsequent talk (if not answered on the spot).

The talks for East Power are scheduled for Aug 7 and 21 at 3pm.  We could potentially have Research members attend the East Power sessions.

Would you like to have this done for Research and what forum would you prefer?

Thanks,
Martin

Subject:	Denise Palmer Huggins Interview

Seminars/Forums, etc. Sub Group

I met with Denise on December 16th and here is a recap of the discussion
relative to our sub group for your information.

Seminars

-Probably no more than 4 per year
-Good curriculum makes a significant difference (ie. quality)
-Keep at a reasonable cost
-Nymex provides seminars which have an audience of 35 to 50
-Denise's experience is that people like topics that are practical adding to
their skill
  base

Forums

- Broader topics than seminars with range of experts
- Can range in size from small groups to very large ballroom settings
- Marketing makes a big difference in turn out

Conferences

- Generally not as excited about conferences
- Shouldn't try one this year
- If do one, keep focused on one topic, not multiple tracks
- Should be lean and mean, cost effective, 2 days max

Nymex has many contacts and should be able to help on marketing events and
perhaps  doing some sponsorship.  Probably should charge for non members for
these events but needs to be reasonable.  Small training sessions could be an
opportunity.

Denise, hope this is a reasonable summary; please add anything I have left
out.

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn

Vince,

This would be Kinoshita.  As indicated below I would certainly like to price a live deal, get Shankman to agree and go out with an offer.  Since not too big, eduction should not be too costly.  Could also collar if required.  If we can handle JCC and RIM then there is much available in the domestic markets.

Vince,

Nothing like a real deal to focus our thoughts on JCC.  JA Aichi is an agricultural association that purchases over 200,000kl per year of Heavy A.  They would like Enron to price a JCC swap (our offer) that would help them manage their Oct 2001 to Mar 02 position as given below.  I'd like to see what we could offer given the volumes and term.  We can then compare with the JCC offers shown by MS.  We are checking the credit of this company.

It would be good to put a live deal in front of Shankman that wasn't too huge or of too long term.  Concept of minimizing the cost of our education and testing our hedging strategy for JCC.

Let me know if you need additional info.  I presume that you are fairly far along with evaluation of JCC and that we should be able to derive an offer?  If not, please let me know.  If possible we'd like to send out an offer next week.

thanks.

Joe

Hi, How are you doing ? 

Have received an inquiry form JA Aichi (Different from UNICOOP) in Japan as follows: 

In order to hedge the price of Low Sulphur A, they want to enter the swap based on 
Crude Oil Index or Gas Oil Index, since it has a correlation with the product. 
It would be very appreciated if you could give me a price as following. 

1. Enron sells swap to JA Aichi (Financially Swap settled monthly)
2. Index    : Dubai Crude Oil, Platts Singapore Gas Oil Reg. 0.5% 
3. Period   : Oct 2001 to March 2002
4. Volume : Oct 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Nov 2001 : 1,000 KL (  6,289 Barrel)
                  Dec 2001 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel)
                  Jan 2002  : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Feb 2002 : 5,000 KL (31,447 Barrel) 
                  Mar 2002 : 3,000 KL (18,868 Barrel)

                  Total         20,000 KL (125,787Barrel)

The Magistrad Worm

    Systems affected: PCs with Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT/2000 with poor
security

    Method of propagation:  E-mail attachment; when opened it attaches
itself to Windows executable files and sends itself to e-mail recipients.
It can grab e-mail recipient addresses from Outlook, Outlook Express,
Netscape and/or Microsoft Internet Mail and News.

    Risk to the Rice campus:  High. It spreads quickly, and it can damage
or destroy files and damage the system BIOS. It does not attack document
files specifically.

Hi again, it's Rick Russell your local virus guy. Two e-mail messages to
ALLDEPTS this morning contained this vicious virus. The virus affects PC
systems with Windows 9X/NT/2000, not Macs or UNIX systems.

For all the details, visit:

immediately. Contact information is included on the above web page.

Please do NOT open attachments without confirming their validity.
Confirmation might include a second e-mail with an exact description of
the attachment contents (including file names and sizes), a telephone
call, or a face-to-face meeting. NEVER open attachments with EXE in the

wait until god opportunities come.

"Tom Limperis","Ken,

We called Tom Limpers and talked about the services his company can offer to
Enron. It seems that they don't have any great product sitting on the shelf. It's rather
a group of university professors who are ready to offer their brain power to solve different
problems of interest to potential customers. 

We talked about different potential projects and suggested in what ways they could
demonstrate their problem solving skills before we go into more detailed discussions.

They promised to get back to us in a few days.

Vince,

I met with Niki last week in which we had a general interview on his interests.  He is finding that he is not fully utilizing his skills at Optimark and that the company is moving more towards software development.  Consequently he is looking at other possibilities.  He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training.  Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development.  Somewhat of a unique combination.  He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments.  In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group.

I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.  Pls let me know if you are able to make contact and see a possibility for him at Enron.

thanks.

Joe

Thank you very much for sparing your time with me, yesterday, and explaining
Enron's dynamic and aggressive business.  It was very impressive and
intriguing.

I have revised my resume and have added information regarding the actual
systems and projects which I have worked on both for Salomon Brothers and
Toshiba.  I have attached a list of publication also.

Please feel free to let me know if you need further information.

I will await for a feedback from you, regarding where I might fit in within
the Enron organization.

I shall be returning to the UK on Dec 23rd, and will proceed to look for a job along with the other 1,500 ex-employees.

Well it's been quite a ride & I'm pretty much ready to get off & move on.

Billy,

We can give Bobby a call and carry out a preliminary interview over the phone.
I am always a bit suspicious when I see somebody trying
to leave a very good company after a relatively short time.

Would you be interested in participating in a panel discussion at @Market
Expo 2001 in Chicago Nov 28-30?  I would like to propose a discussion
similar to the following:

Proposed panel discussion -
Electronic commerce is quickly expanding the capabilities that enable the
exchange of structured derivative contracts.  Derivative contracts,
including swaps and options, embody substantial financial risks related to
both underlying market prices and creditworthiness of participants.  The
technology needed for these new derivative marketplaces includes
multi-parametric exchange functionality, rapid response to changing
preferences for exotic contract structures, and control over the exposure of
financial risk to traders.  These developments promise to bring electronic
commerce into the OTC marketplace.  This panel brings together leaders from
the field of financial risk management to discuss these emerging
capabilities.

Dilbert Newsletter 38.0
-----------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   November 2001



Highlights
-------------------------------------------------
* Scott's Patriotic Duty
* Boss and Cow-orker Quotes
* Holiday Gift Ideas
* True Tales of Induhviduals
-------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

There are 400,000 people in the DNRC, each more attractive,
generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free
Dilbert Newsletter. Maybe that's a coincidence, but I'm starting to
doubt it.

My Patriotic Duty
-----------------

I've been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic
services in this time of global conflict. I don't think I'd be a
good candidate for Special Ops. I'd be the
one with the wheeled carry-on bag saying, ""Hey, guys, I have sand
in my shoe! Is anyone else hungry? Can I use my flashlight now?""

I'm already donating money to patriotic causes, and I bought some
plastic flags made in China, but I felt I needed to do more. Then
it hit me. There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my
entire life: dehumanizing the enemy. In a sense, that's been my
full-time job for years. I just need to replace the word
""management"" with ""Taliban."" So let's get started.

I've been trying to figure out the Taliban's long-term strategy and
I think I got it: They're trying to reverse evolution. Their
uncontrolled body hair is a good start. Living in caves was an
obvious step too.

The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the
children. But they've made great strides in that area. Have you
seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat
on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day? No math, no
social studies, just rocking and chanting. For PE they use sticks
to whack stuffed dummies labeled ""Bush"" and ""Blair."" I'm not sure
how they know how to spell ""Bush"" and ""Blair."" On any given morning
they're probably whacking dummies labeled ""Tqwft"" and ""Upxpgt"" but
it's a good aerobic workout either way.

Just for fun, ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum
could NOT be accomplished by, for example, a monkey: Rocking back
and forth? Chanting? Beating a dummy with a stick? Even if a monkey
only got a ""D"" in chanting, he would still graduate with honors
from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking
and whacking.

As I write this, our generals are trying to figure out how to get
the Taliban out of their caves. They're running sophisticated war
game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence. I
have one word for them:

                       bananas

I don't want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious
insults. As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil, I am willing to
promote them to full-fledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal
footing with everyone else who doesn't read the Dilbert Newsletter.

Now that we've dehumanized the Taliban, let's get on to the
important work of dehumanizing our bosses, cow-orkers and family
members.


Induhvidual Confusion
---------------------

Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others. For
example, they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving
wildlife, vision and their own pants. See for yourself in these
true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Cow-orkers, submitted by
DNRC members:

---

A VP was speaking at a meeting and said, ""Well, you can lead a
horse to water but you can't make him crap."" Someone up front said,
""That's drink...can't make him drink.""  To which the VP said,
""That's stupid.""

---

""In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed horse is king!""

---

A cow-orker once said, ""Looks like he's thrown a wrench in the
monkeyworks.""

---

""A two-prawn approach is necessary.""

---

Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the
other day. We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he
said I was ""preaching to the blind.""

---

""He won't last, he's just a flash in the pants.""

---

One of the employees called in to say that she couldn't come to
work because she ""...had to have an autopsy.""

---

My boss was telling a very involved story about something that
happened to him. He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a
philosophical summary: ""Sometimes fact is stranger than truth.""

---

""It's a catch 20-20.""

---

Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors.
An all-time howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to
ensure success for a campaign and his reply was ""Don't worry; I've
got an ace up my hole.""

---

At a management meeting, my CEO said, ""Our company is like a living
orgasm."" Now that's what I call job satisfaction.

---

I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having
achieved a goal. The Induhvidual replied, ""It was nothing. You
planted the seed, and I ran with it.""

---
In a meeting a cow-orker of mine referred to ""the carrot at the end
of the tunnel.""

---

""We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this
one.""

---

These all came from the same boss:

""Vision is in the eyes of the beholder.""

""Part of the verbiage is a language thing.""

""Eventually, I want it now.""

""It's not that kind of zero.""

""There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions.""

""In the last year, you've turned around 150%.""

---

When a high-powered agent of the company walked into the lunch
room, our secretary remarked to our group that she couldn't stand
him because he was ""so ego-testicle.""  One of my cow-orkers spit
coffee out of his nose, which just added to the moment.

---

""I think you might have hit the nail on the button.""

---

""...caught between a rock and a wet spot.""

---

And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said:

""I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought
of a name for you.""

Holiday Gift Ideas
------------------

When I'm not slaving away writing FREE Dilbert Newsletters for you,
I sometimes make holiday gift recommendations. I believe a gift
should acknowledge the recipient's unique personality and
interests. That's why I organized these suggestions by personality
defect.


For Heathens, Vulcans, Skeptics and Dogmatics:
----------------------------------------------

My first non-Dilbert book, ""God's Debris"" (now in hardcover), is
full of thought experiments about souls, free will and science that
will have your friends and family arguing with each other for
weeks. Combine the book with alcoholic beverages and there might
even be some slapping.

The book is designed to fit in a stocking and to look as if you put
more thought into the gift than you really did. Imagine how smart
you'll seem when you say, ""I found all the errors in reasoning. I'm
sure you will too.""

We probably didn't print enough copies of ""God's Debris"" for the
holiday season (really) - it's way more popular than I expected --
so if it's meant to be a gift, act now. Get several for your smart
friends or get just one and let people borrow it.

You can find ""God's Debris"" at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740721909/unitedmedia/107-5126509-7932516


People With Short Attention Spans:
----------------------------------

I recommend the Dilbert Page-A-Day Calendar for people who can't
handle more than 10 seconds per day of any one type of
entertainment. For more severe cases of attention deficit, consider
the monthly wall calendar or the weekly planner.

Imagine the look on the face of the lucky recipient, full of
unmitigated joy and boundless appreciation for your gift-giving
brilliance.

You can find these calendars at the following links:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715712/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715690/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


People Who Are Hard To Shop For:
--------------------------------

I recommend my new book, ""When Did Ignorance Become a Point of
View?"" It's a compilation of Dilbert comics that won't clash with
anyone's home decorations or wardrobe. And it shows thoughtfulness
because everyone you know has either had a job or knows someone who
has.

Tip: When it's being unwrapped say, ""You'll like this unless you're
dead inside."" That prevents most people from complaining, which is
similar to being happy.

This book is available at:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740718398/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555


For Dyslexics:
--------------

For dyslexics (like me) I recommend the or Calendar Day-A-Page
Dilbert, my book ""Debris God's,"" my and book, ""When Become Did a
Point of Ignorance View.""

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740715674/ref=ase_unitedmedia/104-2285776-7245555

http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/shop/


People Who Stand Too Close:
---------------------------

Dilbert mints, featuring Manage-Mints, Improve-Mints,
Accomplish-mints and Pay-mints are now available at:

http://www.candy2you.com/store/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=CS&Category_Code=D&Affiliate=Dilbert.

The mints are good for people who like tasty mints or bad puns or
collecting little tin containers for who-knows-what purpose.


Plop, The Hairless Elbonian
---------------------------

Over the summer I was experimenting with a Dilbert spin-off comic
strip about a little boy and his pig growing up in the clueless
country of Elbonia. Unfortunately this isn't a good time to launch
a comic featuring people who look like the Taliban. So it's on the
shelf, probably permanently.

You can see the experimental strips at:

http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/plop/

Let me know what you think.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Here now, more true tales of Induhviduals, as submitted by members
of the DNRC.

The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand
reminded me of another version I heard recently.  One of my
relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE.  It took
me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had
pointed out what a latrine is.  They had. She was apparently still
intent on using it.

---

When I received my new credit card, it had the number two (2) after
my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have, indicating
that my name is the same as my father's.  I called the bank's
customer service number and asked that their records be changed to
use the Roman numeral two (II) instead of the number two (2).

The customer service rep said, ""I'm sorry, sir.  My computer
doesn't have Roman numerals.""

---

I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil. During one performance,
where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under
their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing
complicated acrobatics at the same time, an Induhvidual behind me
said to her companion, ""That must take a lot of practice.""

---

At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeare's books
because, ""The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS!""

---

At the grocery store, the checkout woman scanned all of my items
then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar
code so she could scan it.  She asked, ""Do you know how much this
is?""

I said, ""I've changed my mind, I don't think I'll buy that today.""

She said, ""Okay."" I paid her and left.


Dilbert Fodder
---------------

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

I spoke with Bill Finnoff at Prediction Company this morning.  I mentioned
to
Bill your  position at Enron and the high-quality quant group that you
manage
there.  I told Bill that I had recently had a conversation with you in
which
you expressed interest in speaking to someone at Prediction Company about
their experience with computerized trading; and if possible, to arange for
some consulting.

Bill indicated to me that he probably would not be able to provide
consulting
services, but he is able to have discussions with colleagues in his field.
He said that he would be delighted to talk with you and provide you with as
much relevant information as he could within the Prediction Company
guidlines.

Bill's telephone number is: (505) 984-3123.  The office assistant will have
to connect you to his extension.

Bill's e-mail adddress is: finnoff@predict.com


Hope this helps.

P.S.  I have had several conversations with two of the Prediction board
members over the past couple of months.  If this connection would help you,
please let me know, and I'll see what I could arrange.  But, for the
details
of the way things really work, Bill should be an excellent initial contact.

P.S.S.  I thought that I had transmitted this to you this morning, Vince,

P.S.S.  This is the second day that I've not been able to send this e-mail

Subject: Northern Natural Gas



Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken 



Dear ETS Colleague: 

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work! 

Stan

Vince:

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud

Subject:	GPCM News: 1/25/02: Working with Power Model Forecasts: AGA Gas Storage


Working with Power Model Forecasts
 
Recently we have been spending quite a bit of time working with companies who are using both a power model such as Prosym, GE Maps, or IREMM, and GPCM.  These power models compute, among other things, the amount of gas burned at gas-fired or dual-fired generation plants.  These values are frequently then fed back to GPCM as electric generation gas demands.  The idea was that GPCM would produce the prices for the various power demand locations which could then be fed back to the power model for re-calculation of demands.  This iterative process would produce eventually a solution which was consistent between the power model and GPCM.  The difficulty with this idea is that the power model takes too much time to solve to make it practical.  
 
After a lot of thought, I have come up with a different idea which has greater workability.  I would recommend the following:  instead of running a single power model case with an expected set of gas prices for each area, run 3 cases:  essentially a high, medium and low Henry Hub Price forward price trajectory plus best estimates of future basis to each power generation gas demand area.  The results will then be three gas burns at three prices at each location.  We can then construct a demand curve for each demand location based on those three points.  With those demand curves, GPCM can solve for an expected price - gas burn combination which will be an appropriately interpolated value between the 3 points computed by the power model.  
 
When this is done, one final run could be made using the power model and the resulting GPCM prices.  It should produce gas burns very close to the value computed by GPCM and will contain all the information needed by the power modeling team.

Hello, Vince
 
It was a great pleasure to meet you in London.  After our lunch I had interesting discussions with the research group and continental trading group.  How was the response on your lecture/speech?
 
You mentioned that you could send me an interesting book on derivatives.  I am really looking forward to dive into it.  If you have two copies we may have one for reference and one for in-depth study at home.
 
You also mentioned that Tom Halliburton or Pereira could give a hands-on course in SDDP.  As I said, I am very interested in such a course some time this year.
 
Thanks and regards,
 
Andr? Damslora

Hi,

	How are you?  Just a brief note to let you know that I followed up on the letter (dated May 2nd) to Dr. Ken Lay from the President of Howard University.

	I spoke with President Swygert and Dr. Hassan Minor about how Enron may assist Howard University in structuring a new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Center (ISE).

	I was informed that Howard will be forwarding further details onto Dr. Lay and me as to how Enron can help them move forward with the development of the ISE.

	Will keep you posted.

Kind regards,
Iris

>ABSTRACT:
> In earlier work we showed we could not reject the hypothesis
> that returns to investments in Turkey's stock market were
> positive functions of risk generated by the World outside Turkey
> and by risks unique to Turkey. We found statistical evidence of
> Turkey's internal risks producing substantial returns and
> changes in returns over time. This article carries the analysis
> further by bringing our earlier results into a more concrete
> environment, asking whether these risks can be profitably
> managed as a practical matter. In particular we consider results
> of two strategies in trading cross-market portfolios. We examine
> a long position in the ISE Dollar Return Index, offset by a
> short position in the S&P 500 Composite Total Returns Index. In
> this analysis we verify profitability directly by computing
> actual profit produced by an implementable trading strategy. We
> identify our two portfolio management strategies using
> Value-at-Risk-inspired measures of risk and return. We also
> examine the importance of secondary issues in portfolio
> management, such as identification of buy and sell signals and
> selection of a trading position.
>
> We examine two issues determining the performance of a trading
> position in this cross-market portfolio. First, are there
> predictable and substantial periods of time when it is good to
> be long Turkey and short the Rest of the World and the reverse?
> Second, how important is it to monitor the time path of the
> risks unique to Turkey's Financial Markets in comparing returns
> in Turkish and World Markets? Our answers are first, Yes and
> second, Very.

>ABSTRACT:
> We propose and test a novel economic mechanism that generates
> stock return predictability on both the time series and the
> cross section. In our model, investors' income has two sources,
> wages and dividends, that grow stochastically over time. As a
> consequence, the fraction of total income produced by wages
> changes over time de-pending on economic conditions. We show
> that as this fraction fluctuates, the risk premium that
> investors require to hold stocks varies as well. We test the
> main implications of the model and find substantial support for
> it. A regression of stock returns on lagged values of the labor
> income to consumption ratio produces statistically significant
> coefficients and adjusted R2 's that are larger than those
> generated when using the dividend price ratio. Tests of the
> cross sectional implication find considerable improvements on
> the performance of both the conditional CAPM and CCAPM when
> compared to their unconditional counterparts.

>ABSTRACT:
> An exclusive focus on bottom-line income misses important
> information about the quality of earnings. Accruals (the
> difference between accounting earnings and cash flow) are
> reliably, negatively associated with future stock returns.
> Earnings increases that are accompanied by high accruals,
> suggesting low-quality earnings, are associated with poor future
> returns. We explore various hypotheses - earnings manipulation,
> extrapolative biases about future growth, and under-reaction to
> business conditions - to explain accruals' predictive power.
> Distinctions between the hypotheses are based on evidence from
> operating performance, the behavior of individual accrual items,
> and discretionary versus nondiscretionary components of

> This paper models the incentives created by career concerns for

> the consensus on average that about whether or not they are
> exaggerating. The model predicts that agents should exaggerate
> more when they are under-rated by their clients, when the
> realizations of the variables they are forecasting are expected
> to be especially noisy, and when they expect to make fewer
> future forecasts. We find that these predictions are consistent
> with the empirical data on equity analyst's earnings forecasts.

>ABSTRACT:
> We examine the relative prices of ""sibling"" American Depositary
> Receipts (ADRs). These ADRs are issued by the same foreign firms
> against shares with different voting rights. Though superior and
> inferior voting siblings begin their US trading experience at
> nearly equal values, relative prices of Mexican and non-Mexican
> sibling ADRs quickly move in opposite directions. Superior
> voting ADRs command a median premium for non-Mexican firms, but
> a median discount for Mexican issuers. The Mexican evidence
> represents an extreme exception to the inverse relation between
> the voting premium documented in other countries and the degree
> of legal protection enjoyed by outside shareholders. This
> apparent anomaly cannot be explained by differences in cash flow
> rights, total or systematic risk, liquidity, voting control of
> major blockholders, or ownership restrictions. Despite voting
> premiums and discounts, neither sibling in most pairs appears to
> have been an attractive investment for US investors.

>ABSTRACT:
> We use data during 1989-97 to compare the quality of three
> quarterly earnings measures: 'The Street', a pro-forma operating
> income proxy obtained from firms' earnings releases and two
> earnings measures obtained from 10-Q and 10-K reports: EPS from
> operations and EPS before extraordinary items and discontinued
> operations. Three techniques are used to assess quality:
> predictive ability, valuation relevance and information content.
> Predictive ability is examined by determining which measure is
> the most accurate predictor of future quarterly earnings four
> quarters hence. We assess valuation relevance by identifying
> which earnings measure has the most explanatory power and the
> highest earnings multiplier. We determine information content by
> finding which measure has the most explanatory power and
> generates the highest earnings response coefficient. Based on
> our three techniques to assess earnings quality, we find that a
> timely pro-forma operating income measure released by managers
> ('The Street') is of higher quality than either EPS from
> operations or EPS before extraordinary items and discontinued
> operations. Regulators are concerned that users of financial
> statements are misled by pro-forma earnings releases, and that
> they should rely instead on information in financial reports.
> Our findings suggest that users of financial information can
> obtain higher quality earnings measures using pro-forma
> operating income numbers released by managers than they can by
> perusing less timely 10-Q and 10-K filings with the Securities
> and Exchange Commission.

>ABSTRACT:
> This paper analyzes the timing of IPOs by treating the
> going-public decision as a real option. Investors value the
> private firm using publicly observed market prices of firms from
> the same industry. With stochastically evolving market values
> firm insiders want to leave open the option of taking the firm
> public later, after a positive price shock. Going public
> exercises this option, which must be viewed as a cost of
> undertaking an IPO. Optimal exercising of the option dictates
> that IPOs should only occur after price run-ups. Firms never go
> public in a down market because the value of waiting is too
> great. These incentives can lead to clustering of IPOs near
> market peaks. The results generalize to seasoned issues. Each
> equity offering is for a unique fraction of the total ownership
> claim for the firm and is associated with its own timing option.
> Each equity issue is independent of all the others, and
> therefore the timing of an offering is unaffected by subsequent
> issues. Each equity issue is likely to follow an abnormal price
> increase.

Dear Director Kaminski,

I am an MBA student at Rice University. Through our director Peter Veruki's
introduction, I expressed my interest in having a summer intern or part-time
job at your department by email and by talking with you in telephone in
June. Now I am taking my summer intern at JP Morgan Chase. Since your
department is called the development brain of Enron, I am still very
interested in having a learning opportunity to work part-time under your
direction. My updated resume is attached. I will call you next Monday
morning to follow up. Thank you for your consideration.

Joannie:

Thanks
Here is the message for Jeff:



Jeff,

I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation
at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference
is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the
conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).

This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered
in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management
and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda
for the 2002 event is under development.


Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, 
a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation
will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other
energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the 
agenda for the future.

Rick,

Would you look us to make a joint appeal to Jeff to speak
at this conference? Our friends at UT were very disappointed last
time that Jeff had other commitments and I suggested they should
try to get on his schedule early for the 2002 event.

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn

Subject: Employee Meeting Postponed



We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Subject:	Collaboration with Enron

Dear Vince,

I just sent this message to you and Christie Patrick, but I believe I had an
incorrect e-mail address for you the first time.  Hopefully this message will
reach you with no problems.

I hope this message finds you both very well!  As you may recall, I will be
working for McKinsey and Company in Seattle starting this fall.  However, my
interest in energy has continued to grow since Wharton's Tiger Team project
with Enron last spring, and I decided to spend the second half of my summer
working in the industry.

I am currently serving as interim Marketing Manager for e-Acumen, a venture-
backed provider of high-end analytics, software, and advisory services to
financial services companies trading weather derivatives and re-insurers
dealing in catastrophic weather risk policies, as well as to power and energy
industry clients.  Our primary investor is GE Power Systems, while some of our
other investors include Woodside Fund, Perseus Capital, CreateLabs, and
NewVista Capital.

I represent the Weather Risk Services group, which provides consensus weather
forecasts--forecasts that consistently beat the National Weather Service
Medium Range Forecast model--to financial, power and energy industry clients,
of which Enron is one. In addition, the group provides load forecasts to many
of the largest power traders in the country.

e-Acumen's newest product, WeatherAcumen, is a quantitative weather risk
platform based on leading edge portfolio optimization analytics and simulation
techniques.  WeatherAcumen mitigates weather risk by more accurately
determining intrinsic values of weather derivatives, and features proprietary
applications of a non-parametric Monte Carlo simulation engine that provides
high fidelity indications of statistical arbitrage opportunities, resulting in
more profitable hedging and trading strategies.

A WeatherAcumen demonstration is scheduled for September 14 with Mark Tawney,
head of the weather desk, as well as Claudio Ribeiro, Joe Hrgovcic, and
Michael Nguyen.   While they will be considering the functional benefits of
such a platform to Enron's weather operations, I wanted to discuss a longer-
term partnership opportunity with you that could benefit Enron from a
marketing and profitability standpoint.

One possible model for collaboration could involve e-Acumen providing a direct
link from the WeatherAcumen platform to EnronOnline in order to drive
increased trading volume to your site.  WeatherAcumen's superior analytics,
industry-leading weather backcasts and forecasts, and proprietary simulation
technology allow weather derivatives, power, and gas traders to have greater
price-discovery capabilities.  Even better, firms trading with a WeatherAcumen-
enabled counterparty will have more confidence in posted prices, and thus be
more willing to trade on your site.  We feel that such a partnership could
very beneficial to both Enron and e-Acumen.

I would appreciate the opportunity to talk with you in person. Please let me
know if there is a convenient time to call you to discuss how we might
collaborate with Enron.  Thank you very much, and I look forward to the
possibility of working with you again.

Very best regards,

Heather Thorne
Marketing Manager, e-Acumen

SPOT WEATHER ANOMOLIES QUICKLY  Using Syncrasy's proprietary visualization tools, a user can quickly compare the output of up to 4 weather forecasting models for a specific time period.

For an example, view the Multi-Panel Graphic?  on our website.      [IMAGE]   QUANTIFY YOUR WEATHER RISK     [IMAGE]   Syncrasy provides individual forecasts for over 1,600 weather stations in the continental US. For any one of these stations, you can compare all 14 weather forecasts side-by-side either to gain statistical confidence in a particular outcome or to quantify the weather risk of a specific forecast.  If you rely on weather forecasts, you should be aware of the extent to which all 14 forecasts agree (or disagree) with each other. For an example, visit Syncrasy's  Forecast Analysis and Confidence Trading System (FACTS)?  on our website.   WHICH WEATHER FORECAST IS MORE ACCURATE?  Discover which weather forecast has been historically the most accurate for a particular city over any selected time period (such as last week, month, season, etc.). Refine your analysis with data filters.  For example, use a filter to determine which of the weather forecasting models is most accurate when actual temperatures are greater than 90 degrees, or when temperatures change more than 10 degrees within an hour.  For an example, see Syncrasy's  Weather Accuracy & Vendor Evaluation System (WAVES)?  on our website.   CONDUCT DETAILED, PRECISE ANALYSES USING ""DIFFERENCE GRAPHICS""     ""Difference Graphics"" refers to the spatially calculated difference for a single output. Difference Graphics allows a user to analyze discrepancies between any 2 weather forecasting models for any time period.  For example, using Difference Graphics, a user can view the difference in surface temperature between ""Weather Vendor A"" and ""Weather Vendor B"" across the US for tomorrow at 2pm.  A user could also view how ""Weather Vendor A"" has changed since the prior forecast. For an example visit Syncrasy's   Difference Graphics.       [IMAGE]          ENHANCE YOUR WEATHER COMPARISONS TO INCLUDE TRAILING AVERAGES  The meteorological community frequently relies on one dataset for comparative purposes: the ""30 year average."" This ""30 year average,"" however, may not be an ideal comparison as it is defined as the 30 year average over the period from 1961 to 1990. Syncrasy broadens the user's information by including options allowing users to compare any weather forecast to the trailing 30, 15, 10, or 5 year averages.

[IMAGE]        Syncrasy's""Mach-5"" technique expeditiously reports information to users in advance of typical weather data feeds which may experience bottlenecks during peak traffic (or rely on slower satellite communication). To prove Syncrasy's superior reporting speed, our system allows users to test our reporting speed for themselves by comparing our time stamps to that of their best alternative weather data source. Syncrasy records the time at which each weather forecast is available on Syncrasy's system (timestamp in dark green) as well as the anticipated time the weather forecast should update (timestamp in black). Users will find our data reports FIRST offering them a valuable competitive advantage! For an example, visit Syncrasy's  Model Status.     Syncrasy's Weather Analysis Tool (SWAT?  SWAT? collects timely and comprehensive  meteorologically diverse weather forecasts   from multiple forecasting groups, such as National Weather Service, universities, armed services, NASA and other research oriented institutions.  The data is integrated into a single analysis platform.  This platform includes a number of tools which may be useful to a trader and/or meteorologist.  For example, SWAT? assists users in the following tasks:  identifying and quantifying weather risk for some future time period; tracking the historical performance of different weather forecasting methodologies; and, creating a proprietary forecast.
