Subject:	Suggested course in uncertain times

John,

Let me begin by recognizing that you are now entrusted to resolve issues that were not of your own creation.  I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.

The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been ""trust the system until it fails you"".  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.

From 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.

My situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have four responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year; and (4) Despite my expectation of zero bonus I have continued to work diligently (including nights and weekends at your suggestion) at rebuilding this team.

Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.

John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.

Sincerely,
Keith

John, I maybe ""seeing ghosts"" but the prospects of us getting paid under the current form of paper are remote. As per my voicemail, the following changes need to made: 

1. Performance Bonuses - needs to be small caps (ie performance bonuses)
2. remove the words ""to be provided to you under your existing bonus opportunity"" so the sentence reads "" This memorandum describes performance bonuses for calendar year 2001 performance...""
3. after affiliate, insert "" or any of the respective successors, assigns, representatives, trustees or administrators""
4. specify ""U.S $""

"FW: ENA/EES SIC Codes","John,

I talked with Dave.  In addition to his original list we have agreed to the following.

Primary Metals - OK
Refining - OK
Grain and Meat Processing - Too broad.  Baughman should pursue deals but this category includes lots of small retail load.  Dave will think of solution.
Cement - OK
Auto - OK on Big 3, not the parts suppliers
Aerospace - No - EES has global outsourcing with Boeing and Lockheed Martin (the two biggest)
Paper Manufacturing - includes all forest products - OK
Glass - No - they have outsourcing with the largest companies already

In general, this seems reasonable, subject to middle-ground on dealing with agricultural processors.  fyi Baughman is negotiating with Archer Daniels Midland re a 300MW high load factor grain processing load and Luce has several deals with meat and grain processors.

John,

I surveyed the group.  In general, people are fine but we should ask for a bit more.  This should apply to US only as Milnthorp has already cut a separate deal with Janet.

EES Proposed that they own all SIC Codes EXCEPT the following:

Mining
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper Manufacturing
Chemical Manufacturing
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
Fertilizer Industry
Rail Transportation

In our discussion with Dave, we suggested and he agreed that Primary Metals should be added

In discussions with the different regions:

ENA should add: 
Refining 
Grain Processing - Baughman and Luce
Meat Processing - Luce
Cement Manufacturing - Luce 
Auto Manufacturing - Luce, Baughman
Aerospace Manufacturing - Tycholiz, Baughman
Heavy Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (caterpillar, john deere) - Baughman
Paper Manufacturing should include - pulp, board, lumber, etc.
Glass Manufacturing - Luce ( I suspect Dave will resist this because of their Owens Corning deals)


Let me know if there is anything else I should do.

We received the necessary consents to split the PPA into two from both TransAlta and the Balancing Pool last week.  We expect the regulation enabling the split to be passed by the Government during the week of November 12, 2001 thereby forming two units PPA's effective as of that date.

Don Miller and his team are prepared to smile and dial on Monday October 29, 2001 thereby contacting the list of identified customers and initiating the process.

I will send you a timeline shortly outlining the entire process from start to finish.

		Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no small part, to the great people I share this place with. 

		I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family, but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Therefore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have decided not accept the offer. 

		Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday. 

		Best regards, 
		Paul

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1

Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 shares
Relative share price		$27.23							$83.13
Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,658
10% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866
Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792
Current stock price									$10
Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen

further due diligence and would like to start that process, as soon as is
convenient for you.

In addition, I would be willing to discuss the purchase of your gas and
power books, trading floor and other associated assets.   I would like to

"EES Risk","John,

Lots of stuff swirling around, but wanted to give you a few thoughts on me coming to Houston, some business, some personal.

Business:
- Key functions and list of people?
- Immediate Priorities? fix stuff, minimize chaos, cost structure? project execution? 
- Objectives for 2002 - what could this thing look like after 12 months? Should we be in this business?  Do we price correctly?
- Reporting structure, book ownership, my relationship to you, Dave, etc., management committee?
- Figuring out west power - Belden or other structure (I have not talked with him in the last few weeks)

Personal:
- Dealing with the risk of moving to Houston when Enron could still implode
- Mitigants: Bonus, retention stuff nailed down, prepaid relo or bridge loan
- Max relo package including buying house, house rental?, etc.
- Getting the family unit down there - 

You have my complete loyalty and I obviously trust you, but these are extraordinary times.

Regards,

Chris

Dear Mr. Lavorato:

Following up on your and Ken Lay's conversation with Gary Cohn, I would like
to forward the following proposal, acting for each of Goldman Sachs Capital
Markets and J.Aron.
> In order to provide Enron North America with additional liquidity, J. Aron
> and GSCM have discussed entering into the following series of transactions
> on terms to be agreed between each of the relevant parties:
>
> 1.  Enron Corp./J. Aron - FX Option sold by Enron Corp. to J. Aron with a
> settlement date of Dec 11, 01 would be settled on Nov 21, 01.
>
> 2.  Enron NA/GSCM - Interest Rate Swap Portfolio - At Enron NA's option,
> we would either (a) close out and portfolio on Nov 21, 01, resulting in a
> payment from GSCM to Enron NA or (b) bilaterally reduce applicable margin
> trigger from $10mm to zero, which based on current MTM would result in
> $10mm of additional margin being paid by GSCM to Enron NA.
>
> Weather Derivative Transaction - Applicable margin trigger would be
> reduced from $50mm to $5mm, which based on current MTM would result in
> ~$18mm of margin being paid by GSCM to Enron NA.
>
> 3.  Enron NA/J. Aron - Financial Derivative Portfolio - At Enron NA's
> option, we would either (a) close out and portfolio on Nov 21, 01,
> resulting in a payment from J. Aron to Enron NA or (b) bilaterally reduce
> applicable margin trigger from $10mm to zero, which based on current MTM
> would result in $10mm of additional margin being paid by J. Aron to Enron
> NA.
>
> Physical Natural Gas Receivable - In consideration of the foregoing, Enron
> NA would settle $10.5mm physical natural gas receivable for value Nov 21,
> 01.
>
Please call me at the number below at your soonest convenience to discuss
further.  Thank you.

So after paying at Barton Creek.  We split the bill 3 ways.  They added another $ 800 to my Amex.  I think they may have added the other room to the bill although we cancelled it and they resold it.  Can you check what the 800 was.

"Re: FW: Contract sale idea","Interesting idea.  Here are some of the issues we would need to think about.
California - since Direct Access is suspended, we would need to evaluate that the  assignment would void our   contract ( at least one commissioner at the PUC is still trying to further  limit DA ).  would need to check with our DASR team to see what restrictions exist on DASRing
Assignment - the contracts generally would require consent to assignment by the customer
confidentiality - may need consent of the customer to show the contract to the seller
DYNEGY - would need Dynegy consent to the sale
Other - issues may exist after we read the contracts.  At least one of the customers on this list is bankrupt (Paradise Textille).

I'll wait for some business direction before we start anything. 

Thanks. Vicki

Subject:	FW: Contract sale idea

 		


Guys, I think Don has a good idea here - but it needs to be managed prudently.

a) Mark who do we talk with in Dynegy to inform them that we are selling or otherwise disposing of material contracts or assets of EES?
b) Jeremy, it is important to have a view on the viability of getting these customers to agree to an assignment and releasing us on confidentiality issues so that we can approach dealers/producers/utilities with a tight book?
c) Vicki, clearly legal issues on the contract (ie) confidentiality, assignability, DASRing or assignment in a post non-deregulated California, etc.

These issues need to be vetted before we approach any producers.

The idea is to raise significant cash quickly

Please respond ASAP.

Regards
Delainey

I think Sempra or one of the producers would have interest in buying these contracts (obviously with a haircut)

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Did Montovano clarify things for you? Also, Roy Boston may give you a call. I know you may be skeptical( at best) of me at the moment, but I care as much as anyone about salvaging this company and its enormous talent and I also ""get it"" in terms of what's necessary to get there( the perception last week  that I was trying to hang on to an organization and organization structure that was obsolete is just dead wrong....I was trying to salvage as much of an organization that I and others are convinced has always produced bottom line value far in excess of its cost( unfortunately, I failed on this point with two of the most important people at Enron, you and John...and I'm talking before this ""crisis"" set in)...I do recognize the need for the cuts we're about to make. Hopefully, in time, I can regain the confidence of you and John. Thanks.

"","They best way to manage your day gas problem would be to find counterparties that you are long last day prompt swaps (that are expiring now), and take them off throughout the day.  For example, if a counterparty wants to reduce settlement risk, you can have a futures broker help manage match swaps counterparties and do an offsetting futures position, from which you can get long futures.

This is top exposure by Counterparty and an Enron entity level.  This does not take into account OTM positions with affiliates.  Be aware the data is a direct download from the risk systems and has not been checked for accuracy.

We are still scrubbing the data for assignment opportunities to reduce margin positions.  We will brief you sometime tomorrow.

We have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3-way offset transactions. Much appreciated. Even today in the west. But I don't think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity. Pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won't even discuss. We are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all. I have informed our traders to be o
pen to such opportunities, but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. That's why the interaction of your traders is vital. There are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot. Hope you can help.

I also just got a writeup of a potential new 4-year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your EES supply desk. I am reviewing now. Of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure, so making room in other areas makes so much sense.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"California Update p.2; 5/29/01","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Senator Keeley Spearheads a New ""Plan B""
State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy

Keeley's Collective ""Plan B""
Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan ""as soon as possible""; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is not this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republicans were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so they developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  However, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough Republican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much tougher fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will be able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people who would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.  Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez ""Plan B's,"" Keeley's new plan is said to:
Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to ""high-end customers.""  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who would not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate component is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to 12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate component for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B that will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough to cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forward purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of power is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to continue operating.
The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission assets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan would be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return on the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, the value would be credited toward the loan.
In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native power generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would have to pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for direct access to power.
If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go forward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollect.  Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transmission assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets would become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constitutional.

Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy
Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding ""Plan B"" and the legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering Keeley's ""Plan B"" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of bankruptcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking seriously about purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans remain strongly opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of PG&E (except for the transmission assets, which it would retain).

"Your May 31 Pay Advice","This message is to inform you that information contained on your printed pay advice for the pay period ending May 31, 2001, may be misleading.

Regardless of whether you have single or multiple direct deposits, your net pay is correct, but your pay advice will indicate that all of your pay has been deposited collectively to ""Other Bank"".  It does not list specific bank accounts.  However, if you view your pay advice in eHRonline, you will be able to confirm your scheduled direct deposits and verify the accounts to which the deposits were made.  

You may access eHRonline and view your pay advice by taking the following steps:

?	Click the following link to open eHRonline:  https://ehronline.enron.com 
?	Read the disclaimer
?	Click Accept
?	Type your SAP Logon ID (e.g. your ""P"" ID) in the User Id field.
?	Enter your SAP password in the Password field.
?	Click the Logon button.
?	Select Paycheck Inquiry from the drop-down list
?	Click the radio button next to Results in Period to select the default for the May 31, 2001 pay advice
?	Click the Continue button.
?	Click the link for the 05/16/2001-05/31/2001 pay period to display your pay advice.
?	Scroll to the bottom of the screen to view your direct deposit details.

"FW: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid","

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

John, 

I am not sure if I have already sent you this resume. 
Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago 
and was greatly impressed by him. He may be a good candidate to

"Entergy joins SETRANS (southern, etal) RTO","Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal).  I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes:
 
-- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)
-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules
-- LMP
-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)
-- One Security Coordinator
-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area
-- local planning in Entergy footprint
 
He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.
 
Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later.  Christi

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

"Connecting with Ivey Alumni just got easier!","A MESSAGE FROM DOUG SPEERS, MBA 1970, CEO OF EMCO LIMITED AND
CHAIR OF THE IVEY ALUMNI ASSOCIATION BOARD

Dear John,

I am writing today to introduce an exciting new initiative from the Advancement Department at the Ivey Business School in conjunction with the Ivey Alumni Association Board that will benefit all members of the Ivey community. It's our new on line service called eZone!!

Collaboration is the hallmark of an Ivey Business School education. eZone offers us the ability to collaborate with members of one of the premier associations of business leaders in the world - the Ivey Alumni Network. A little further below, you will see the address for the website and the username and password that you need to log in.

CONNECT WITH CLASSMATES
My Communities is where we'll be able to have online discussions, share ideas and build relationships with classmates and other members of the Ivey Community. Send a request for a new community to Ivey Advancement today!

BUILD YOUR NETWORK
Turn to My Directory to locate a classmate or other member of the Ivey Alumni Network, or to find out how to contact a member of Ivey Faculty or Staff - for the first time, eZone brings together all members of the Ivey Community: Alumni, Students, Faculty and Staff.

MANAGE YOUR CAREER
Click on My Career to post a resume, to view online job postings targeted to Ivey Alumni, and to link to Global Workplace, a unique service open only to alumni from many of the world's premier business schools. Global Workplace gives you access to a worldwide database of senior executive appointments and automatic notification of relevant opportunities.

READ THE NEWS FROM AN IVEY PERSPECTIVE
On the eZone homepage, take note of Ivey in the News. There you will find links to articles about Ivey Alumni and the School that have appeared in the media, and see which of your classmates has been appointed to a new position.

UPDATE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION
Community is not something we can take for granted. With the job market facing such uncertainty, it is very important for Ivey Alumni to be able to contact and network with one another. Take a minute today to update your particulars by clicking on My Information in the upper right hand portion of the screen - and don't forget to check the box beside Publish.

Of course YOU CONTROL what information other members of the Ivey network can view about you, but we'll all benefit from a robust Alumni Directory.

Take a few moments and look at eZone today!!

Navigate to http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/ezone and use your username and password to start to benefit from this excellent site

Username: JLavorato.HBA1989

Sincerely,

Doug Speers

"RE: If we were going to pay....","Plan is to pull Accounting, RAC, IT, Back Office, HR, Research, EES, EEL, EBS, etc., names today. I was assuming you could just give me EA names minus ENW, Colwell, HR, and accounting, which I would get from functional leads.  I've told most people this may be roughly 10% but in some case it should be 0% others maybe deeper (maybe up to 20%).

We can go over list this evening and make changes.

Remember logic is:

People we need to help us through bankruptcy
People who are critical to core business which would otherwise hamper our ability to sell/operate
People who could easily get other jobs
People who are critical to keeping lights on
People with critical knowledge on deals/transaction we need to manage or unwind in next 2/3 months.

Top analysts and associates - we have started ranking and will be finished today.

What is Beck's list and does it include IT or is it the list we did?

Power Scheduling too.

...some bonuses this week (with some reclaw plus penalty), putting aside yourselves, the guys we already took care of, Colwell, Headicke, Beck and my people, is there anyone else in EA you would like to make a case to pay?

Plan today is to get these names and proposed numbers pulled together for Greg this evening. Plan was to ask Colwell, Headicke etc., separately, if you want to review their names I can let you see them later tonight.

I plan to sit over in old building (16.71) and do this this afternoon noon till 5pm. You can either call me on my cell or have Jeanie walk list across.

"Tomorrow - 5/30","Tammie,

Please don't forget that I will be out of the office tomorrow and Thursday.  I have elected to have an amnio done.  My appointment with the high risk doctor is at 8:45 am tomorrow morning.  They will do an ultrasound for about 1 hour and then do the amnio.  I have been told that I need to be a ""couch potato"" for 24 hours.  This is why I will be out on Thursday as well.

John has asked that you sit in at my desk tomorrow.  My passwords have stayed the same.  You should be able to add me as a viewer of your email and access it from my pc.  My Lotus Notes password is lipstick1.  John has a flight Thursday afternoon and a driver has already been arranged.  If you double-click on the entry on his calendar you will see the details as well as a phone number for reference if there should be a problem.  He will be out on Friday.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will have a second doctors appointment tomorrow at 10:00 with my regular OB/GYN so I should be home around noon.  Please feel free to call me if you need anything.

Kim

"Split PPA","Gents,

I thought that I would let you know that Rob Hemstock informed me last night that Murray Smith (Minister of Energy) got the PPA Division Regulation through Cabinet yesterday.  This essentially allows us to split the PPA with the remaining steps being a formality.  The Sundance B PPA will become the Sundance B3 and Sundance B4 PPAs within the next week.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"FW: question","John-

Late October, Enron announced a change in the administrator for the Enron Savings Plan (our 401(k)s) and locked us out from making any changes in our asset allocations or contribution rules until November 20. This has generated an awful lot of resentment and deep conspiracy theories. Can you ask the Board to offer a remedy to those affected by this?

"Trading Track","John,

Just a few things coming up:

1.	Elizabeth Shim - getting pretty negative feedback in her logistics rotation currently - this is now two rotations where she has not performed.    Suggestion, that 1) she probably needs to rotate out of the Trading Track formally and 2) probably needs to find another home. Comments?


2.	A London analyst is looking to come back to the US - has ranked well, currently in EBS.    His resume is attached... I would move to have him screened by two traders and interviewed on the 1st November along with everyone else (albeit by telephone).   

 
3.	As you know, Emil Carlson is in Stockholm - not sure if you wanted to drop him a line.


Let me know your thoughts on the above.

Thanks, Karen.

While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.

"FW: Contract sale idea","Guys, I think Don has a good idea here - but it needs to be managed prudently.

a) Mark who do we talk with in Dynegy to inform them that we are selling or otherwise disposing of material contracts or assets of EES?
b) Jeremy, it is important to have a view on the viability of getting these customers to agree to an assignment and releasing us on confidentiality issues so that we can approach dealers/producers/utilities with a tight book?
c) Vicki, clearly legal issues on the contract (ie) confidentiality, assignability, DASRing or assignment in a post non-deregulated California, etc.

These issues need to be vetted before we approach any producers.

The idea is to raise significant cash quickly

Please respond ASAP.

"RE: VMAC Transaction","Seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty - this changes the function of EnronOnline to a margin exchange mechanism.  Long run not a short term solution.

Subject:	VMAC Transaction 

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this,

Other retail marketers are starting to come out of the woodwork to purchase power for retail intitiatives.  The pending deals listed are those with >50% probability of closing.  Obviously, none of these deals are binding, and as we execute some of these, we will re-evaluate the position.

JPMorgan Chase and Citi/SSB are doing due diligence for a short term liquidity facility.  They have specifically asked for a better understanding of the T&M business.  I suspect you have a canned presentation that you use.  That will be fine.  They are very focused on cash generation.


	Trading & marketing business:
a)	What effect of a global slowdown on the business both short-term and long-term?
b)	If capital is restricted to T&M companies in general, can ENE continue to grow volumes?
c)	What happens to ENE's earnings & cash flow if volume growth slows / declines - is there an annuity part of the business?  (How much of future cash flow has been monetized through pre-paid transactions?)
d)	What happened to ENE in Europe during the quarter (volumes grew substantially and no earnings growth)?  
i)	Is this a long-term phenomenon?
ii)	Can / will something similar happen in North America
e)	What is the status of global deregulation?
i)	Scaling back venture in Japan?
ii)	Reports that gas competition in Germany is facing difficulties
iii)	Laying off people in Europe
f)	What is current VaR - if not lower than at 12/00 & 6/01 - why not?

"Re: Eletrobolt","John:

We still do not have a deal with the government.  They have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks.  The latest is that they have said that they will give us something on Tuesday of next week.

With respect to the burn rate, we are projecting about $20 million in expenditures over the next month.  Our current investment is about $220 million.

I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months.  The investment is currently funded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB.  The WestLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations.  The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehicle.  This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the take-out of the WestLB vehicle.  We are currently in the process of syndicating the equity.  We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity.  We hope to have another next week.

There are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of.  WestLB did not want to take operating risk in the financing.  Our position with WestLB is that we do not reach  commercial operations until we reach the start date of the Petrobras contract.  We are currently producing energy into the grid.  At some point, WestLB could try to force us to take out the entire vehicle prior to the OPIC funding.  Depending upon the timing, this could represent a cash flow of up to $280 million for a short period of time.

Please let me know what other questions you have.

"Cash","Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??)

(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month
	Probability:	50%
	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

(iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)

Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.

"California Update 5/29/01","Executive Summary
California Treasurer Angelides Sets Dates for Bridge Loans & Bonds
California's Supreme Court May See Challenge to ""Plan B""

Angelides on Bridge Loans and Bonds
CA Treasurer Angelides has said that beginning 15 August, the state will set up a bridge loan.  The revenue bonds will not be issued until September or October.  Angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in July or August.  However, he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in October and November.  This is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the DWR and from other parts of the government, not on payment terms for power.  He fears there will be a cash management problem.

California Supreme Court to Challenge ""Plan B""
California Attorney Michael Sturmwasser is expected to challenge ""Plan B"" before the California Supreme Court on the basis that it results in a retroactive rate increase and that it removes the PUC's authority to review power purchases.  This is because ""Plan B"" enables SoCal to collect a dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going forward.  SoCal (and PG&E) would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate component to be able to operate going forward and remain credit-worthy.  This takes the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off the state's balance sheet, a key goal of lawmakers.  However, at the same time, it also abrogates the PUC from its responsibility to review power purchases.  The state cannot give the utilities a blank check (in the form of a dedicated rate component) to operate without taking authority away from the PUC.  According to the California constitution, the legislature can add to the responsibilities of the PUC, but it cannot take away powers from the PUC.  At the same time, ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for power that they have already used.  Sources describe Sturmwasser's case as ""arguable""; in other words, it has a fair chance of succeeding.  However, regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails, it is very likely to cloud the issue of the bail-out and significantly deflate the prospects of the Plan B.

If FERC were to impose cost-based controls on power prices, sources believe it might ""go a long way toward avoiding these problems.""  Were this to happen, the PUC could declare FERC's rates ""just and reasonable,"" which would likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep SoCal liquid.  However, such measures by FERC require significant lead time.  Sources state that ""the state needs to tease the feds into doing this.""  This can be done by conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data FERC would use for determining the cost controls.  Sources report that this process of ""teasing"" FERC has not yet started.  This is chiefly because California politicians are focused on flat price caps, which FERC is very unlikely to impose.  It appears the state is asking FERC for the wrong measures, which is delaying the process.  The only way for the state to avoid these constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities, as municipal entities would not be subject to PUC regulation.  However, there remains very significant opposition to this idea, especially on the Republican side.  A state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain momentum once Plan B began to fail for the reasons cited above.  Additionally, a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were both utilities in bankruptcy.

Sturmwasser is a partner at Sturmwasser & Woocher, a Santa Monica law firm.  (His offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in Santa Monica, overlooking the beach.)  He has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years.  His clients include the consumer advocacy group TURN (Toward Utilities Rate Normalcy), among others.  Sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to support the legal challenge, but if he cannot find money elsewhere, he will likely be able to support it out of his own pocket.

"RE: Sale of Napoleonville Land","Louise,
 
On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.  
 
Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen ""victor.""  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule.
 
Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction.
 
I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187.
 
Regards, Jean

At 4pm on Wednesday Liza arrived with the DASH.  It had not been circulated prior to that and there was no-one available to discuss the deal as Eva was not in the office.  Please  have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the DASH in advance of when you want it signing.

4pm on Wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn't give enough time to complete a DASH.

Louise, 

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM. 
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental). 


I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

"Potential Long Term Transmission Purchase","we may have an opportunity to buy either 10 or 20 years worth of transmission from the northwest (john day) to COB.  we currently own roughly 170 MW of this under a long term deal with wapa that was assigned to epmi from pge back in 1998.

here's a summary of the facts on the new transmission
100 to 200 MW for either 10 or 20 years
purchase at prevailing pge rates -- if rates go up our payments go up.
monthly demand charge equal to roughly $1.10/MWh.  this equates to roughly $80k per month per 100 MW of transmission.
npv of the cost of the transmission (not value but cost) is $10 million per 100 MW for 20 years.
the spreads from nw to cob are roughly $2.50 on peak and $1.00 off peak.  line losses are roughly $0.75/MWh.
this transmission helps our cash, real time and services desks in addition to whatever value swerzbin extracts.
pge has the lowest tariff rates for intertie transmission.  can't guarantee that it will stay that way but is likely.
transmission rights would convert to an ftr if/when rto is implemented.
mike and i both want to do this transaction.
what do you think?
do we need to dash this?
we need to get this done by October 31.

"Cash analysis spreadsheet","Hi John.  Here is the spreadsheet. 
 
A couple of comments/assumptions:

Only trades done after 8/26/01 are considered (bid week started on the 27th in August).
Only North American physical gas products are considered.  All numbers are in USD; an assumed conversion of 1.40 CAD/1 USD is used for the Canadian CAD trades.
For index pricing, an index of 3.00 USD is used.
Since on Sep 25, only the spot trades done during Aug 27-30 actually roll off, there isn't much of a rolloff on that date.  There is a much larger rolloff after Oct. 25.
The first sheet has the summary data.  Each column represents the net cash we owe a particular customer as of that date.  If they owe us, the value is set to 0.
The other two sheets are supporting data.  Actually, the 1st sheet is just a copy of the second one, but the spreadsheet takes so long to calc, it is easier to play around with the summary page if you remove the dependencies on the third sheet.

Call me if you have any questions/requests.  (713/504-7540).

I arrived early today hoping to catch you.  I don't know if you've looked at your packet to see the $5 million correction I made to your Canadian Gas Daily, I wanted to fess up to this mistake in person.  There is a note on your packet, if you need to talk to me about it, please call me.

"RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)","
The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

Subject:	Talked to Bryson

FYI.  I ran into Bryson last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it. 

Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?

Best,
Jeff

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Coralina, you'll recall that all of the above companies were set up to be part of the Power Plant/Regasification facility JV with Union Fenosa.  That has died, and these companies are now considered ""shelf"" companies, with no business and no purpose; however, we cannot keep them as such, since they are costly, I'd like to dissolve them before year-end.

Would you kindly send me a return message with your approval to proceed with dissolving all of the above entities.  I of course will send an annoucement memo company-wide (""Notice of Intent to Dissolve"") to give those involved a chance to review and respond back if there is any reason NOT to dissolve them.  I do have one group wanting Enron Dominicana B.V.

Thanks Cora.

Be assured that I am extremely sensitive to the issues affecting board members in Canada.  We also have similar issues in the UK.  We will endeavor to communicate as best we can.  However, all behavior with respect to your concerns must be practical in light of Enron's cash management systems.  We cannot always hold a board of directors meeting in order to effect a wire transfer.  I am choosing not to interpret your memo as some sort of threat, but as an effort to highlight a reasonable concern.

"TD Waterhouse IPO Center is accepting Conditional Offers","TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of Anthem, Inc., which is expected to price on 10/29/2001.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
- Login to your account
- Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then click on the ""Continue"" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the registration statement and the price as determined by the managing underwriter. This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by 3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously submitted Conditional Offer. Please note that the e-mail notification will likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided an
e-mail address that you are able to access after that time. You may change your e-mail address at anytime via the ""Update E-mail"" function within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the ""IPO Order Status"" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you want to reaffirm, and clicking ""Reaffirm Conditional Offer"".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period, your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price, determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an allocation of shares.

Thank you,

TD Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.
Member NYSE, SIPC.

"California Update 6/08/01","
CPUC Delays QF Payment Vote 
Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs 15% of  their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a ""preference payment"" to the QFs (the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity, given the current environment) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15% payment.  The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.  It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal's and PG&E's cash flows currently.  Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.  This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.

"FW: Meeting 10/25 at 10:00am JPMorgan/Chase and Citi/SSB","Meeting is tomorrow 10/25

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Caudell, Greg  
Sent:	Wednesday, October 24, 2001 4:52 PM
To:	Lavorato, John
Subject:	Meeting 10/24 at 10:00am JPMorgan/Chase and Citi/SSB
Importance:	High

John:  Listed below are questions that the banks have asked us to address in the meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning at 10:00am in Room 20C2.  JPMorgan Chase and Citi/SSB are doing due diligence for a short term liquidity facility.  They have specifically asked for a better understanding of the T&M business.  I suspect you have a canned presentation that you use.  That will be fine.  They are very focused on cash generation.


	Trading & marketing business:
a)	What effect of a global slowdown on the business both short-term and long-term?
b)	If capital is restricted to T&M companies in general, can ENE continue to grow volumes?
c)	What happens to ENE's earnings & cash flow if volume growth slows / declines - is there an annuity part of the business?  (How much of future cash flow has been monetized through pre-paid transactions?)
d)	What happened to ENE in Europe during the quarter (volumes grew substantially and no earnings growth)?  
i)	Is this a long-term phenomenon?
ii)	Can / will something similar happen in North America
e)	What is the status of global deregulation?
i)	Scaling back venture in Japan?
ii)	Reports that gas competition in Germany is facing difficulties
iii)	Laying off people in Europe
f)	What is current VaR - if not lower than at 12/00 & 6/01 - why not?

"Contingent Call Options for Power","Given Enron's focus on what is core vs non-core, David Hoog and I would like to spend some time with you early next week (Monday or Tuesday) to go over the unit contingent call option product (CCO) and why we believe it should be considered a core activity for Enron's power desk.

The attached summary briefly descibes this past year's activity, what has changed in the market place, and our strategy for 2002.  Our experience managing the CCO portfolio of trades this past summer confirmed we can successfully manage the price risk through the purchase of power options and swaps. The support and cooperation of the power traders and originators was also critical to our success. In addition, excess reinsurance to cover the P100 risk was available, but not as economic as using derivative hedges so we declined the cover. Excess reinsurance is a viable risk management tool and one we are currently putting in place for the 2002 season.

Let me know if meeting makes sense to you and I'll book a time for Monday or Tuesday. If those dates don't work, we'll work around your schedule.

Thanks.

"Enron plans to oppose Dynegy in FERC power issue","A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at 
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow ""capacity"" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Subject:	Sale of Napoleonville Land

Louise,

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the ""Act of Sale"" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).

I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding ""war"" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

"Eletrobolt Update","John:

The following is a quick update on the actions that we have taken with El Paso:

Nov. 19 - I met with El Paso's commercial team giving them a full briefing on the project.  During the meeting we signed a confidentiality agreement and I delivered to them a full data-room disk with approximately 80 project documents.

Nov. 21 - We delivered a follow-up email with two additional documents completed in the interim.  We scheduled a site visit for Nov. 28th for the date requested by El Paso.

Nov. 26 - We delivered all additional information requested by El Paso in preparation for their site visit.

We are currently awaiting further requests from El Paso to schedule further conference calls to address specific issues.  These will be scheduled immediately upon their request.

Please let me know if you hear anything from Greg Bafalis.

Thanks,
Brett

"Sithe Demand Charge Escalations","Dear John -

The attached worksheet has my perspective on how the tolls should be escalated.

I still think this is a conservative view, since I feel that we would be able to go to these pipes and negotiate a fixed toll for the remainder of the term, or even negotiate out of these contracts for a fee. (I'd love to take a crack at that!)

TCPL is still a wild card, and I did not change the escalations that were shown.  More will not be known with them until they get through their new rate design process, which will probably be another year (since they haven't even filed anything yet).

Call if you have any questions..

Julie  :-)

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Kitchen, Louise

To:	Schoppe, Tammie
Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Rick

Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no small part, to the great people I share this place with. 

I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family, but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Therefore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have decided not accept the offer. 

Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday. 

Best regards, 
Paul

"Northwest Reserves","We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds.  $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book.  During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.

Attached for your review is the process that I am pursuing at Mariner.  I
would like to discuss it with you tomorrow if you are available in person or
by phone.

Also, it appears that Mariner has another discovery in its Swordfish
prospect.  The results from the 1st well are positive and we are preparing
to drill the 2nd well in the next few days.  Second well will be down around
Christmas.  A definitive economic impact is impossible to provide at this
point but could be in the $15-$25 million range +.

"Special Assets--Enron Executive Services","
For several months we have been working on an idea to exploit the staff and experience we have in Special Assets to develop a fee-for-service ""executive services"" business.  The key idea is to participate in potentially rewarding companies and projects without commitment of Enron's investment capital.  I believe that this would be a logical extension in applying the skills and management approach we already are taking with our own portfolio.

As part of some initial feasibility evaluations, we recently have had discussions with Bill Gartland, a Houston entrepreneur, with extensive contacts with national and provincial governmental development agencies in Spain.  Gartland is seeking management and financial expertise to promote industrial, commercial and real estate projects in Spain.  Among other things, he presently lacks the professional skills to evaluate and package projects for presentation to sophisticated capital providers in the United States and Europe.

In addition to checking personal and business references, we had Rick Carson's group perform a due diligence review of Mr. Gartland.  His background and reputation are clean.

Through Gartland's contacts we have been invited to meet with representatives with the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Indrustriales (SEPI), the Spanish state-owned holding company for business development.  In addition, we will meet with representatives of Instituto de Fomento (INFO), the regional government of Murcia's business development group.  INFO has agreed to fund all of our incountry expenses while in Murcia on this initial visit.

In order to take advantage of this opportunity we have accelerated our plans to test the market for the types of services we envisage providing and are scheduled to meet with SEPI, INFO and other contacts in Spain the week of June 11th.  

Unfortunately, with the tight schedule we could not arrange a general meeting to cover the concept of Enron Executive Services (EnronExec).   However, we have prepared an informal presentation as a briefing prior to next week's trip.

I would stress the following points:

These initial meetings are informational and relationship focused.  No commitments will be made next week.

One of the key principles of EnronExec is that we are not a source of capital.  Among the services we offer will be analysis of capital needs and preparation of business and/or project plans for presentation to capital providers.

Activities contemplated for EnronExec will complement the normal workload of Special Assets.  There will be no reduction in our efforts to achieve our primary business objectives for the team.

The expenses to evaluate the potential and, if viable, to startup the activity are modest and are consistent with our approved 2001 expense plan.

Our eventual objective to fund EnronExec is to structure cash fees at least sufficient to cover staff time and out-of-pocket costs.  We will look to acquire significant equity participation that would offer the attractive potential value upside.  As a byproduct benefit through contacts with various businesses, we may identify new synergies and opportunities for other Enron businesses.

I am very enthusiastic on EnronExec.  It appears that it may be a way to leverage Enron's unique resources and strengths into a profitable enterprise that does not require separate capital.  I would appreciate your comments and questions.

So after paying at Barton Creek.  We split the bill 3 ways.  They added another $ 800 to my Amex.  I think they may have added the other room to the bill although we cancelled it and they resold it.  Can you check what the 800 was.
 
Thanks

"Meeting","Louise and John,

Thank you for having the meeting with all Gas and Power origination this morning.  I was very impressed by the employee attendance and your responses to individuals' concerns.  I would recommend having periodic meetings in the future.  My only disappointment was the most of my questions should have been articulated by my employees because they were concerns and queries articulated to me these past few days.  I have appropriately chided them and will chalk it up to stage fright.

Regards, Mrha

"RE: Sleeves/bookouts","We should condition all ""free"" sleeve trades on future trades with the counterparty.   For example if Reliant does not do at least 20 trades per week with Enron, then an $0.25/Mwh charge will apply.
 
I simply don't believe these guys will do incremental business with us at this time so why not make some money in the sleeving process.   I can almost assure you that these counterparties are motivated to do these trades anyway.   Once they are done cleaning there books with us, they will do very limited business (only very large margin deals like the 4 yr EES supply deal and then command a huge cash collateral.).
 
I will do what you ask, but I strongly disagree.

We have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3-way offset transactions. Much appreciated. Even today in the west. But I don't think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity. Pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won't even discuss. We are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all. I have informed our traders to be o

pen to such opportunities, but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. That's why the interaction of your traders is vital. There are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot. Hope you can help.

I also just got a writeup of a potential new 4-year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your EES supply desk. I am reviewing now. Of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure, so making room in other areas makes so much sense.

"How Are Your Investments Doing Today?","Dear Morningstar.com Premium Member:

With the market gyrating more than usual, monitoring your investments
in a timely fashion has never been more critical.

We can't do anything about the market (though we wish we could).
However, you've made it easy for you to monitor the stocks and funds
in your portfolio--and those you've earmarked as prospective
opportunities. Just go to:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/Sub_center.html?memail=alert112701p

Then tell us what you want to receive. Here's a quick rundown:

NEW PORTFOLIO ALERTS
Exclusively for Premium Members, these Alerts report on the
performance of your portfolio in five areas: Asset Allocation,
Investment Style Box, Mutual Fund Expense Ratio, Stock Overlap, and
Stock Sector. You decide the lower and upper limits in each of these
areas and we notify you when they hit your low and high targets.
Where to find them:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/xrayalerts.html?memail=alert112701p


NEW INTRADAY PRICE QUOTE ALERT
Alerts you to changes during the day, while the market is open. You
set an upper and lower limit for stocks, ETFs, and closed-end funds.
We e-mail you when a price goes above or below your limits. (You can
use this alert for open-end funds, too. Since these are priced once a
day, at the end, you'll receive an alert at the close of the day.)
Ideal for keeping an eye on investments and prospects in today more
volatile market. Where to find it:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/intraday.html?memail=alert112701p


STOCK AND FUND ALERTS
Alerts you to changes in any of the 35 different criteria you set.
You can ask for alerts on stocks and funds in your portfolio. You can
also ask for alerts on stocks and funds you just want to keep an eye
on. It's a convenient way to watch over your holdings--and to be in a
position to take action on potential investments of interest to you.
Where to find them:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/sfalerts.html?memail=alert112701p


PORTFOLIO UPDATE
Updates the value of each of your portfolio holdings every evening
after the markets close. Also provides you with links to news stories
about your holdings. It's another quick, simple way to keep up with
your investments--even if you don't have time to be online during the
day. Where to find it:
http://www.morningstar.com/rd/portupdate.html?memail=alert112701p


Our completely revamped and improved alerts are among the most
sophisticated on the Web. So, give them a try now at:

"HPL and Pan Nat accounting","
A follow up to your questions on the accounting for the above:

HPL - when Gosset began marking the position 9\30, our balance sheet gave your book the $33 Million annuity that we held as the difference between the $2.34 (original swap price with B of A) and the market price at the time of the bammel unwind.  He obviously needed this amount to keep your book whole when he began marking it.  Included in the $33 was the original $1.2      bid\offer spread.  On October 1, when Jeff pulled the total marked value off of schedule C and recognized the income, he recognized the bid\offer spread as well.  All Accounting looks clean!

Pan Nat - The day 1 booking of the arbitration changes resulted in a $18 MM loss that we booked to the office of the chair.  Since that time I am told that all of the related resid positions that you now hold are marked everyday and taken into income.
Again accounting looks fine.


The only two items that remain in the ""Wes Colwell"" accrual book are the (1) mark of the Napoleonville pad gas and the related hedge (scheduled to begin the withdrawls 8\02) and (2) the hedge of the financial obligation to fill the Enron 1 cavern with financial gas.  You locked in the capital contribution for about $20 million with the hedge.  The hedge began liquidating in September and we began paying Bridgeline.  The payments take place for 4 months.

Call me with any questions

"URGENT - ENA Associates & Analysts"," 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley

"TD Waterhouse IPO Center is accepting Conditional Offers","TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of Principal Financial Group, Inc, which is expected to price on 10/22/2001.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
- Login to your account
- Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then click on the ""Continue"" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the registration statement and the price as determined by the managing underwriter. This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by 3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously submitted Conditional Offer. Please note that the e-mail notification will likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided an
e-mail address that you are able to access after that time. You may change your e-mail address at anytime via the ""Update E-mail"" function within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the ""IPO Order Status"" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you want to reaffirm, and clicking ""Reaffirm Conditional Offer"".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period, your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price, determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an allocation of shares.

Thank you,

TD Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.
Member NYSE, SIPC.

The enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product, by counterparty, for a number of liquid gas products.  Each column represents the life-to-date position generated on that product, for that customer, through the date in the heading of the column.  

I don't see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions.  

If I can put this into a more convenient form, let me know what would help.

15% discount rate on equity;
Exelon Board approval would be required;
There were some tax issues to be problem solved; and

On a back of the envelope, I think there offer is probably over $300 million in cash, but may have some significant book loss implications.

Their filing asks that the order should be in affect around the clock instead of just during Stage 1, that the actual costs be tied closer to the pricing of the product, and anyone that exceeding the cost-based pricing system have a 100% penalty.

Hertzberg and Keeley had a press conference today at 1:30 PST.  Questions included the impact of today's ruling and how it would affect Plan B, Hertzberg replied he was not sure.    He also indicated that they support the Feinstein bill and if the lawsuit or the rehearing efforts do not work, legislation is the last chance for price caps.  Hertzberg also indicated that he was getting to the point where CA ""may just say no to prices that are too high"" (via buyer cartel).
