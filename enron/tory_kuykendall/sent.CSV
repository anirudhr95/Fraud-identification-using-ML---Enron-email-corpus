Dave -- 

I've access to the MKM data sources and am investigating what resides there and how 
it can be requested and assembled.  I spoke to Thomas yesterday and it looks like they 
have all the ERMS curves and can convert the curve amounts into any currency so Frankie's
rate service might not be required afterall.

My hope is to use MKM to retrieve the data sets as XML, smash them together on time boundaries,
and use XSLT to peform simple math, translation and presentation functions.

I've updated Tori that I now have access to the datasource and am looking into what's 
there and how to assemble it.   Fortunately for me she's been very patient -- as I've not been 
able to provide her with an estimate yet, but will do so as soon as I understand what's all involved.

Kim

Here are Jake's thoughts on the situation.  Chris said he would be willing
to take you to lunch - completely under the radar if you can break away
sometime.  He said you can also just call him at home to discuss how the
environment is (team vs. individuals focused on bonuses).  He also indicated
the package for your level is in the six figures.  I have all his
information if you need it.  By the way, he reports up through Randy right
now...

On another topic.  Rick Riley thinks we are about to see capitulation in
Enron.  He thinks we should through out a number we are comfortable with and
when the stock comes down hard, it will take the number out (10K shares a $9
is what he recommends).  He also believes it will be a short-lived hard
drop. Then the stock will spring back up very quickly (I suppose he means to
above book value) and underperform the market for six months.  He thinks
Enron employees who stay on board will be rewarded handsomely..

I have heard that a couple of companies have stopped trading with them, but
I don't know which ones.  I don't think the banks will let the company
totally go down, but I do think they are in for a rough ride over the next
year or so.  The problem is that Enron is such a huge player in the energy
markets that the market is fairly illiquid and inefficient without them.
Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest (including the banks and
counterparties) for Enron to make it out of this.

Tori,

	I just wanted to give you an update.  We hope to be able to start work on building your report early next week.  We are currently looking at two sources of data and
working with other teams on who can provide us with the best source.  As far as the Canadian prices I did find out we have real-time access to the currency rate so converting
that to US should not provide any issues either.  I'll be in touch early next week.

Thanks,

Please Email me your date preference and I will get back with you on the date chosen and I will get back to you with all the other details.

We just refinanced this past Monday.  We were going to do a 15 year at 6%,
but changed our minds and decided to do the 30 year again, but could only
get 6-5/8% (still much better than the 8% we had before).  We are still
going to pay on it like a 15 year mortgage, but the 30 years gives us
flexibility to make the lower payment in case of an emergency.  5.75% sounds
really good -- do you have to pay points to get it that low?  I like 15 year
loans for the interest rate, but like 30 year loans for the flexibility --
it's really a matter of personal choice.  That's why we went with the 30
year and will pay like a 15 -- it costs a little more (due to int rate) than
a straight 15 year mortgage, but is kind of an insurance policy because you
only have to pay the small 30 year payment.  Sorry to hear about the golf
membership.  I know how much you enjoyed that.  We have focused this entire
year on paying down debt, so we really haven't saved anything other than
401k and ESPP.  However, we payed off my student loans back in March and
will pay off the car next month (yeah!!).  After next month, our only debt
will be the house.

We are just glad that Tori is up this year and was up last year in her book.
Basically, her desk has agreed to put their head down and make as much money
as possible.  That way, if the axe starts falling, it falls somewhere else. 

The employees in general are disgusted with upper management and would
prefer for all of them to be replaced.  Who knows, if the stock remains too
low you would have to consider the possibility of a hostile takeover (i.e.,
GE, Exxon etc..).  All speculation of course.  In short, we have lost alot
of money and are making changes in our finances to accomodate in future
issues.  No more golf membership :(   

We are considering refinancing again at 5.75 for 15 years.  It saves us 160K
over the life of the loan.  Any thoughts on 15yr mortgages?

Not much going on.  I am hoping CPN stays low for about another 5 weeks so I
can load up with my ESPP $.  I get a 15% discount on the price on the last
day of Nov.  How are things going with Tori over at Enron -- it sounds like
they are in a bad situation over there.

Still in the process of refinancing - we should close in a couple of weeks.
Susan doesn't want to start trying for a baby until after the holidays.  The
answer to your Calpine question is a little complex, but the short and
simple answer is the following:

1.  Although there is a lot of new power coming online, most companies are
not accounting for the fact that a lot of the old generation will be
displaced by the new generation (i.e. the new generation is much cheaper to
operate, so it will ""win"" the battle in the end).

2.  New power generation has not kept up with the growth of the 80's and
90's - plain and simple, this is a fact.  However, if we go into a
long-lived recession, some of the growth will erode.

3.  A lot of the current plans for more generation will not materialize.
Many companies will shut down plans to build more generation because of
fears of over-building.  Whoever gets the new generation on the ground first
will force the other companies to back off.  In the 80's, Calpine's CEO
recognized the fact that there would be a lack of power in the US by the
late 90's and into the 2000's.  Therefore, he bought call options from the
major turbine producers (GE, Westinghouse, etc.) which gives us the rights
to a large portion of the turbines that are currently being built and will
be built over the next few years.

Jake,

What does Calpine see that the rest of the world doesn't when it comes to
power?   Calpine keeps building-out to produce more power and the so called
""experts"" indicate there is a glut of power coming out.  I don't
understand..   Any thoughts?

I heard you guys refinanced the house :).   I hope everything is going well
over at CPN.   Any new developments on the Baby front or are you guys just
still practicing :).

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

Hello All!

Just wanted to give you guys an update.  The weather looks good for the
garage sale this weekend.  So that is a good thing.  

If you want to bring your stuff by Friday evening, that might be a good plan
for us all to get things set up.  That way all we have to do saturday
morning is drag the tables out of the garage.  Also, I do not have a rack
for hanging clothes, so they will have to be folded or hung on the fence.

How about coming over friday evening around 630-7pm.  Also, if you have any
card tables, please bring them.  I have one and am borrowing two from my
parents.  But I am sure we may need a couple of more.

I bought a couple of garage sale signs on Monday and plan to put them out on
the main street, South Braeswood.  Another idea would be for us to take out
an ad in the greensheet.  Someone told me they cost around $15.  I am in the
process of getting some info as to the exact cost and will let you know when
i get the info confirmed. I am leaving that up to the majority vote as to
whether we all chip in for the add or not.  I think it may be worth it, some
people look for those adds and spend all day saturday doing garage sales.
But whatever you guys think

The hours of the Sale will be from 7am-1230ish.  I think by then whatever
doesn't sale either goes home or to goodwill.  I know some of you cant be
there all day or right at 7am, but I will need some help so let me know what
time you plan on coming over that morning.

Ok, so to summarize all my chatter, 3 questions, 1:  do we take out an ad in
the greensheet?   2: are you coming over friday to set up? and 3:  what time
will you be there on sat?

See ya

Jennifer

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

you are the first to reply. So I will let you know about the consensus on
the ad thing.  

We will probably be up around 615 on Saturday.  I don't plan on fixing
myself up for the event.  Probably just throw on some shorts and a hat.  

So if you can't make it Friday, then let me know what time you were thinking
on Saturday.  No big deal, just wanted to mention that we would be home on
friday evening for those who wanted to bring the stuff over that night.

So what all do you have for the sale??

I have a coffee table, end table, typewriter, stereo speakers and then some
other misc stuff.

I'm happy to hear that your chances to stay on are good, but like you said
it never hurts to explore the outside world.  Things are going pretty well
for me, I'm actually on my week off from work.  I'm still working on the
Real Time desk, I really enjoy it.  The shift work doesn't bother me, I only
end up working about 12 days a month so there is plenty of free time.
Stacey is no longer with Bristol Myers.  She and one of her co-workers
wanted to job share, but the company denied them, so she is working part
time as a nurse.  It's pretty cool, she gets to set her own schedule and she
only works twice, sometimes three days a week.  Our goal was to get her on a
part time position.  We are ready to have a little bundle of joy ourselves,
I think we are going to start trying in May.  Any advice?  Keep me posted on
what happens at Enron.

Take care.

Scotty

I left keith's as well.  Hopefully you two are both big swingin' dicks in the industry these days and my potential new employers will swoon over your glowing praise!  For now though i am trapped at my parents' house wasting days doing little other than reading.  Its indian summer here in mass today though so i'm going to get outside before the sun goes down.  Read a couple of good books while i was away, Rich Man Poor Man by Irwin Shaw and Memoirs of a Geisha w! ere both pretty good.  got any recommendations of your own?

Are you still up for next Sunday.  If so....ya'll could plan on coming at
12:30 or so.  We can cook out and also take a tour of the canals on our
little boat if ya'll are up for it and ...... if the weather cooperates.
If Erin isn't ready for her boat rides we can take turns going!

John and I have to go to Memorial City that night for a opening party.
It's casual, but we would need to start getting ready around 4 or so!

What do you think?

I'll keep you informed next week as to how it goes.

Tori,

I received your name from Diane Hoyuela. You and I spoke
back in 1999 about the gas industry. I tried briefly back
in 1999 and found few opportunities during de-regulations
first few steps. Well,...I'm trying again. I've been
applying for a few job openings at Enron and was wondering
if you could give me an internal referral. Also, any advice
on landing a position at Enron or in general as a scheduler
or analyst.
Last week I applied for these positions at Enron; gas
scheduler 110360, gas analyst 110247, and book admin.
110129. I have a pretty good understanding of the gas
market.

I've attached my resume for you. Congrats. on the baby!
I'll give you a call this afternoon to follow-up, I know
mornings are your time.
Regards,

Fritz Hiser

Hi all,

We need to figure out how much we owe and to who now.  I think we all
agreed
we would not include food now, only the flowers, stuffed animals, cake and
stroller.

Tori, you mentioned to me you spent $65.00 on the cake, flowers and
animals.

Dana, can you please let us know the total for the stroller?  If you did
already I apologize.  I don't remember it.

I think Saturday went great...we all worked so well together and Jennifer
was very happy.  Cheers to us!

Thanks!

Subject:	Hello from UT

Hola,

If all recipients would please be soooo kind as to respond back with a home
mailing address....except for suebob and jojo..got your's already.

Well, we I made it safely to UT.  We made the drive in about 2 days getting
to Provo the 2nd evening and Park City the following morning.  Now I am
reminded why they always say that it is much safer to fly than to drive
cross country.  The first day we NARROWLY avoided running out of gas in
NOWHERE texas...and I also got a speeding warning from a state trooper.  The
2nd day of driving across UT on a two-land highway from Moab to Provo was
harsh...it was snowing..i had a deathgrip on the steering wheel while
oncoming cars blinded me with their headlights and john slept.  Those are
just the bad parts but it was well worth the time hanging with John and
seeing the country.

I've met my 3 roomates, Jimmy, James & Thomas... and they seem normal and to
John's delight none of them will be gracing a ""Gorgeous Hunks of Park City
Utah"" calendar anytime soon.  It has been snowing almost non-stop since I've
been here...and it seems that everyone is off to ski or board here in town.
I'm trying my best to hold off until the end of the week when all of my
skiing and boarding activities will be free.  I am scheduled to start this
thurs at the bakery.  I'm considering picking up another part time job just
to keep things interesting, but I'm going to see how things go with a 40hr
schedule first.

I hope everyone is doing well.  I just wanted to say hello and most
importantly get everyones home address. So take care all and I'll be in
touch.

Sno-mo

Hello Mrs. Kuykendall, hope all is well with you and the baby.  All done with my trip round the world (and got a big boy email account as well now that employers will be looking at it!) and of course i have to go through the dreaded interviewing process to find gainful employment..... just spoke with a head hunter lady who is going to help me find a trading job in gas/power and of course i left her your name as one of my many pristine references.  I left keith's as well.  Hopefully you two are both big swingin' dicks in the industry these days and my potential new employers will swoon over your glowing praise!  For now though i am trapped at my parents' house wasting days doing little other than reading.  Its indian summer here in mass today though so i'm going to get outside before the sun goes down.  Read a couple of good books while i was away, Rich Man Poor Man by Irwin Shaw and Memoirs of a Geisha w! ere both pretty good.  got any recommendations of your own?

Subject: REvised October Nominations


Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-

As I said to Kim, I made an error in the total amount of gas we have
purchased for the month of October.  One contract (2500MMBtu/day) ended in
September.  Therefore the total nomination for month of October 2001 is
14,529MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the
following:
 
1. 4,029MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses
4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of
1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
 
As before, losses on the PG & E line are unchanged from September 2001 at
2.57%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.
 
We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect,
temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit
(Broadway 3) is on line and a second one, Broadway 2, is off and on during
the month.  During the last few days of September and the first week of
October, we will have our third steam unit Broadway 1 online for testing.
Usage should be up during this time.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve

Subject: Our tree trimming storey.....



Bryan and I decided to start putting up the Christmas decorations this
week.  Sunday, we got the tree out of the closet and set that up in the
living room.  Our plan was to do a little bit every night.  By
Thanksgiving, we would have a beautifully decorated house.  On Monday,
Bryan put the lights on the tree.  Then I started unwrapping some of the
ornaments.... just to look at them.  Well, after I unwrapped *all* of the
ornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree.  Bryan was hanging back
and letting me do most of the decorating.  Though I did notice that one of
the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole
ornament.  After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights and
admired our tree.  That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find my
NEW ornament.  He had put something new on one of the trees.  (we have a
charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.)  I
could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the big
tree.

After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me said,
""Look for a ring, look for a ring"".  But the practical side of me said,
""Find the ornament"".  Well, just about then I found a beautiful diamond
ring hanging from the heart shaped Nicole ornament.  My engagement ring had
been on the tree the entire time.  I was so focused on the decorating that
I never saw it.  Bryan has since been teasing me that any other woman would
have known right away that there was a diamond ring on the tree.

I am very happy and excited to tell everyone that Bryan and I are engaged
to be married.  We do not have a date, time, place or even a ctiy yet.  I
just couldn't wait to tell everyone.  I know that I will be wearing a big
smile for a long, long time!

Happy Holidays, Nicole

2.  Deal confirmations - Anne Bike misbooked a deal for me from March, cost $3.5 million.  How do we deal with this issue of confirmations missing deals.

3.  Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.  We need to do a good job of coordinating when we are out.

Jeff,

If there is no limit to size, we would ideally like to move everything within the following directories:

o:\ect_trading\West
r:\webcontent\GasTrading\west_desk

Let me know if we need to narrow these anymore.  They include all west desk files on the network excluding those in the central fundies directories.  Also, will we have a mechanism to transfer individual network directories from the H: drive?  In not, we'll move everyone's directories into one of the above directories.  Thanks.

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

Subject: Anybody Interested in going to the Theatre


Ed and I are getting tickets to Tuna Christmas and wanted to know if any of
you were interested in going with us.  Here is the scoop:

Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm

Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive home
but the show is not coming to Houston this year.

Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good
seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit together.

I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday, say
by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the
play.

Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our tickets by
tomorrow.

Jennifer

Hello Friends!

Anyone interested in going to dinner this Friday night?  Ed and I haven't
seen you guys in awhile and with the holidays coming up, it may be January
before we can all get together again.  I am open for suggestions as to where
we go.  Guess it really depends on the number of people we have that can
make it.  However, I was thinking around 7pm as the time.  Momma over here
gets hungry and tired early, so don't want to make it a late night.  :)

Let me know if you are interested in getting together.  Pam feel free to
invite Carla and her husband as I know you mentioned something about that
earlier and Pat and Tori please bring Erin if you want.  We would love to
see her and can go where she will be welcome.

"FW: Overview of Investor Conference Call","

Subject: Overview of Investor Conference Call


Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Since you want to make the reservations, why don't you go ahead and choose.
Someone else can pick next time and make the reservations.

Hi everyone,

This is a reminder about dinner Wednesday night, November 14th.  Is
everyone
still available?  We should pick a spot and I will make reservations.  I
only ask we don't do BBQ.  I can't get excited about BBQ. ;-)

OK guys - I need help deciding what gift to get for the shower.  Jennifer's
registry can be viewed on the internet at www.babiesrus.com.  I was
thinking we could get her one of the more expensive items since there are 5
of us pitching in.  Susan suggested the 3 way pack n' play portable playard
-- sounded good to me.

Let me know what you think.  My plan is to go pick something up next
weekend.

Thanks.

Hello Ladies!

I've talked to all of you and you all have expressed interest in
co-hostessing (if that is a word) Tripp's baby shower. I just wanted to
send
out an initial email to let you know where we are and a date.

*    After perusing a calender and talking with Tripp, the planned date
is Saturday, November 10th. (I know the time between Thanksgiving and New
Years is crazy for everyone and right after New Years is cutting it close
since Tripp is due Jan. 20th plus or minus 2 weeks.)

*    It will be a brunch (11-1ish).

*    Tripp will send me an invitation list around October 1st.

*    At this point, Tripp is undecided on whether it will be just a girls
shower or a couples shower.

*    Tripp is thinking that it may be about 15 people max.

*    The default venue will be my place; however, Susan has offered to
use her place which I may need to take her up on because our living room is
really only good for 10 people max. Susan are you still okay with that?

As we get closer, I will send out a list of things we need to do and let
you
pick what you want to do. Or let me know before then if there is anything
you are dying to do.

See you soon!

If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago, 
it would now be worth $49. 

If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock) one year
ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit, you
would have $79. 

My advice to you is to start drinking. Heavily.

Here are Jake's thoughts on the situation.  Chris said he would be willing
to take you to lunch - completely under the radar if you can break away
sometime.  He said you can also just call him at home to discuss how the
environment is (team vs. individuals focused on bonuses).  He also indicated
the package for your level is in the six figures.  I have all his
information if you need it.  By the way, he reports up through Randy right
now...

On another topic.  Rick Riley thinks we are about to see capitulation in
Enron.  He thinks we should through out a number we are comfortable with and
when the stock comes down hard, it will take the number out (10K shares a $9
is what he recommends).  He also believes it will be a short-lived hard
drop. Then the stock will spring back up very quickly (I suppose he means to
above book value) and underperform the market for six months.  He thinks
Enron employees who stay on board will be rewarded handsomely..

I have heard that a couple of companies have stopped trading with them, but
I don't know which ones.  I don't think the banks will let the company
totally go down, but I do think they are in for a rough ride over the next
year or so.  The problem is that Enron is such a huge player in the energy
markets that the market is fairly illiquid and inefficient without them.
Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest (including the banks and
counterparties) for Enron to make it out of this.

Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-

As I said to Kim, I made an error in the total amount of gas we have
purchased for the month of October.  One contract (2500MMBtu/day) ended in
September.  Therefore the total nomination for month of October 2001 is
14,529MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the
following:
 
1. 4,029MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses
4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of
1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
 
As before, losses on the PG & E line are unchanged from September 2001 at
2.57%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.
 
We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect,
temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit
(Broadway 3) is on line and a second one, Broadway 2, is off and on during
the month.  During the last few days of September and the first week of
October, we will have our third steam unit Broadway 1 online for testing.
Usage should be up during this time.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve

Subject: Our tree trimming storey.....



Bryan and I decided to start putting up the Christmas decorations this
week.  Sunday, we got the tree out of the closet and set that up in the
living room.  Our plan was to do a little bit every night.  By
Thanksgiving, we would have a beautifully decorated house.  On Monday,
Bryan put the lights on the tree.  Then I started unwrapping some of the
ornaments.... just to look at them.  Well, after I unwrapped *all* of the
ornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree.  Bryan was hanging back
and letting me do most of the decorating.  Though I did notice that one of
the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole
ornament.  After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights and
admired our tree.  That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find my
NEW ornament.  He had put something new on one of the trees.  (we have a
charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.)  I
could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the big
tree.

After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me said,
""Look for a ring, look for a ring"".  But the practical side of me said,
""Find the ornament"".  Well, just about then I found a beautiful diamond
ring hanging from the heart shaped Nicole ornament.  My engagement ring had
been on the tree the entire time.  I was so focused on the decorating that
I never saw it.  Bryan has since been teasing me that any other woman would
have known right away that there was a diamond ring on the tree.

I am very happy and excited to tell everyone that Bryan and I are engaged
to be married.  We do not have a date, time, place or even a ctiy yet.  I
just couldn't wait to tell everyone.  I know that I will be wearing a big
smile for a long, long time!

Happy Holidays, Nicole

are going to try.  Diane can probably update you with more details as it
gets closer.

I want to look at some places near Katy.  I am going to try to look at the
Equestrian Center and maybe the Cinco Ranch Country Club (if it lets
non-members use their facility).  I am going to try to have a all-in-one

the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole
ornament.  After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights
and
admired our tree.  That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find
my
NEW ornament.  He had put something new on one of the trees.  (we have a
charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.)
I
could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the
big
tree.

After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me
said,
""Look for a ring, look for a ring"".  But the practical side of me said,
""Find the ornament"".  Well, just about then I found a beautiful diamond
ring hanging from the heart shaped Nicole ornament.  My engagement ring
had
been on the tree the entire time.  I was so focused on the decorating
that
I never saw it.  Bryan has since been teasing me that any other woman
would
have known right away that there was a diamond ring on the tree.

I am very happy and excited to tell everyone that Bryan and I are
engaged
to be married.  We do not have a date, time, place or even a ctiy yet.
I
just couldn't wait to tell everyone.  I know that I will be wearing a
big
smile for a long, long time!

Happy Holidays, Nicole

Subject: Driveway Sale


Hey guys!

Looks like the driveway sale is on for Saturday morning Oct 27th 7am-Noon.
I was thinking if you wanted to bring stuff over to set up we could put it
in the garage on friday night and then you guys could meet at our house
around 645am on Sat. and we can drag it all out in the driveway.  If we wait
to get started setting stuff on tables until sat morning, we would have to
start really early.  I know this is early, but believe me those garage sale
people get started early and by noon things will be dead.

The only request I have is that you label all your stuff and stay to help
sale it.  Depending on the cost, I may put an add in the chronicle.  Or I
may just put a sign out on South Braeswood by the JCC.  What do you guys
think?

I apologize for not getting back with you all last week.  We ran a few transactions on the spread product with the Auto Hedge function, but no hedge transaction was booked.  Unfortunately, this function is not available on the spread product itself.  I will let you know if/when a solution is available to accomodate this request.  It has been brought to our attention before.  The only immediate solution would be to manually change the risk book, but I know you guys do not want to go that route.  I'll be in touch.

I want to put a stop-loss on MS at 49.  It's support is at 50 and if it

We can hold if you want to though.  SAP already said they would not let CMRC
go bankrupt.  SAP also indicated CMRC book value to be no less than $4.00.
We should probably just ride this one out.  I have no idea about CPN...

If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago, 
it would now be worth $49. 

If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock) one
year
ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit,
you
would have $79. 

My advice to you is to start drinking. Heavily.

I bought Jennifer's gift last week -- I ended up getting them a stroller
since what we originally picked out had already been purchased.

I wanted to get your opinion on something -- the stroller box is pretty big
and heavy.  I'm not sure how much luck I would have getting it up to the
second story of Susan's house, so what I was thinking was that we could
give her a card which says what we got her and either leave the actual gift
downstairs at Susan's house during the shower or in the back of my Jeep and
I could drop it off at Ed & Jennifer's house after the shower.  Also, if we
go with the card idea, do you think I should still wrap the stroller box?

Let me know what you think.  I'll be at work today until 4:30.  I'm taking
off tomorrow so if you need to get in touch with me tomorrow, just call me
at home and leave a message if I'm not there (713-721-7101).

She's a pro a rolling over and grabbing and chewing on everything she can get her hands on.  I wish you guys could see her.  I'm attaching a picture even though it's a little old.

 
After you see this  - I won't have to tell you how much she looks like her daddy.  Life has definitely changed, but for the better.  Believe it or not, I haven't gotten drunk in over a year and have no desire to do so - HA!!  I'm still working at Enron, trading away -- it's still been the best move I ever made.  Pat is now at Waste Management after getting laid off from the little .com company.  Again, a very good turn of events.  We are loving Katy, especially with the swimming pool built in the back yard and some really great neighbors.  
 
Enough about me -- please write back with updates - I feel like I've totally lost touch and I don't want to keep it that way.
 
 
Take Care and talk to you soon,

Hello Friends!

I am contemplating having a driveway sale at our house on Saturday Oct 27th
from like 7:30am-1pm.  People get started early at those things and then it
dies off early afternoon.  I don't have a ton of stuff but thought you guys
might have some things you were looking to get rid of.  I only want to keep
it to this small group of people as i think if we get more than this it
would be too confusing.   

I only have 2 conditions:  if you bring stuff over, you must stay to help
out and sell it.  We could do shifts as we won't need everyone there the
whole time.  But everyone would have to be there at first to set up.
Second, all unsold stuff must be taken with you that afternoon.  

It could be somewhat fun, if we make it that way. The sale would be in our
driveway as i don't want stranger hanging out in our garage.  

Let me know if you are interested in participating.  I will let you know if
the response is positive.

Jennifer

Subject: Bunko Party


With most of the email responses back, the consensus is that there is no consensus.  Half of the people can make it on the 7th, and the other half can make it on the 14th.  Since we cannot get the majority of the people together, I suggest that we have a beginning of the New Year party with the significant others sometime in January.  Please let me know if this is OK with you. 


Thanks, 
Kim

Several Enron Bowling Association members  were unable to participate in the Special Olympics Bowl-A-Thon on Saturday November 17, 2001.  Your support is imporant to the success of the atheletes.

The purpose of the Bowl-A-Thon was to raise funds for the Atheletes with Mental Retardation to compete in year-round sports and  training that will enable them to develop not only physically but emotionally and socially.

Dennis Lee has received 100 T-shirts (sizes ranging from L to XXXL) to sell for a $25 donation to continue raising funds for Special Olympics.  We are asking each EBA member to sell  3 to 5 shirts.  

Please pick up T-Shirts from Dennis Lee   EB3982   ext. 31715

We appreciate your support especially during these uncertain times.

Thank You In Advance

Tori:  This is really a central issue, but they are asking us for the appropriate curves. I think they have been asked to move some old central deals from WNG Williams to WFSC\Perminan.  My suggestion is:

intraminth Curve  - IF-ELPO/PERMIAN
gas daily curve   -  GDP/ELPO/PERM2.

Let me know what you think.

I set up the new zone in Global, however before we can move any deals to this location it needs to mapped
to a valid intramonth, long term and gas daily curve. Wes, can you or someone in risk let me know which curves?
Perhaps it can be mapped like some other location that already exists.

Thanks
