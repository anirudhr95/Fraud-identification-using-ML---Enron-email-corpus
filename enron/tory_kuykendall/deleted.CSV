"Work Hours","Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

"FW: A THANKSGIVING POEM","


A THANKSGIVING POEM

    TWAS THE NIGHT OF THANKSGIVING, BUT I JUST COULDN'T SLEEP
    I TRIED COUNTING BACKWARDS, I TRIED COUNTING SHEEP.

    THE LEFTOVERS BECKONED -- THE DARK MEAT AND WHITE
    BUT I FOUGHT THE TEMPTATION WITH ALL OF MY MIGHT.

    TOSSING AND TURNING WITH ANTICIPATION,
    THE THOUGHT OF A SNACK BECAME INFATUATION.

    SO I RACED TO THE KITCHEN, FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR
    AND GAZED AT THE FRIDGE FULL OF GOODIES GALORE.

    I GOBBLED UP TURKEY AND BUTTERED POTATOES,
    GREEN BEANS AND CARROTS, STUFFING AND TOMATOES.

    I FELT MYSELF SWELLING SO PLUMP AND SO ROUND,
    'TIL ALL OF A SUDDEN, I ROSE OFF THE GROUND.

    I CRASHED THROUGH THE CEILING, FLOATING INTO THE SKY
    WITH A MOUTHFUL OF PUDDING AND A HANDFUL OF PIE.

    BUT I MANAGED TO YELL AS I SOARED PAST THE TREES ...
    ""HAPPY EATING TO ALL - PASS THE CRANBERRIES, PLEASE.""

    MAY YOUR STUFFING BE TASTY, MAY YOUR TURKEY BE PLUMP.
    MAY YOUR POTATOES 'N GRAVY NOT HAVE A LUMP.

    MAY YOUR YAMS BE DELICIOUS, MAY YOUR PIES TAKE THE PRIZE
    MAY YOUR THANKSGIVING DINNER STAY OFF OF YOUR THIGHS.


    MAY YOUR THANKSGIVING BE BLESSED!!

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"FERC Initial Decision in Hearing on TW Negotiated Rate Deals","FERC today issued an Initial Decision in the hearing in the Transwestern case concerning several negotiated rate agreements to which Indicated Shippers and the CPUC had raised objections.  Briefly, the Judge ruled that Transwestern had not exercised market power and that the capacity was advertised and awarded in accordance with Transwestern's tariff.  However, Transwestern must modify its tariff to add a separate provision where all the posting, bidding and award procedures for purposes of awarding capacity are clearly stated.  A highlighted copy of the ruling is attached for your information.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Dog Fight

George and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all.  They sat down 
and decided to settle the whole dispute with one big dog fight.  They agreed

that they would have five years to breed the best fighting  dogs in the 
world and whosever dog won would be entitled to dominate the world.

Osama and his dog handler Mohammed found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and 
Rottweilers in the world, then bred them with the biggest, meanest Siberian 
wolves they could find. From the litters, they selected the biggest and 
strongest puppy and trained it day and night to fight to the death.

After five years Osama and Mohammed came up with the biggest, meanest dog 
the world had ever seen.  It's cage needed steel bars that were five inches 
thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, George and his dog handler Boudreaux, 
showed up with a nine foot long Dachshund.  It was the strangest looking dog

anyone had ever seen.  Boudreaux said it was a Cajun Dachshund.

Everyone felt sorry for George and Boudreaux because they knew there was no 
way that this poor excuse for a dog could possibly last 10 seconds with 
Osama's big, mean animal.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund slowly came out of it's cage, 
wagged it's tail, then waddled over towards Osama's dog.

The Doberman/Rottweiler/Wolf snarled and leaped out of it's cage,then 
charged the poor Dachshund.  But when it got close enough to bite the 
Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and ate Osama's dog in one

bite. There was nothing left at all of the snarling beast.

Osama came up to George and Boudreaux shaking his head in disbelief.  ""We 
don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people 
working for five years with the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers, 
and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves in the world.  How did you do this?""

""Da's easy"", said Boudreaux, the Cajun.  ""We 'ad our bess plasic surgins 
workin' fo' five year for to make dat alligator look like a weenie dog.""

"Re: FW: erin pics","
What a cutie!  Will I be able to see her in person on the 28th?  You are
welcome to bring her!

Are you still up for next Sunday.  If so....ya'll could plan on coming at
12:30 or so.  We can cook out and also take a tour of the canals on our
little boat if ya'll are up for it and ...... if the weather cooperates.
If Erin isn't ready for her boat rides we can take turns going!

John and I have to go to Memorial City that night for a opening party.
It's casual, but we would need to start getting ready around 4 or so!

What do you think?

Jennifer mentioned we should all do dinner together once a month.  I think
it's a great idea and would like to commit to the next date.  How about
you?
I was looking at Wednesday, November 14th.  This is definitely open to
suggestions.

"New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

Ed and I are going to dinner at Maggiano's on Wednesday and wanted to
know
if anyone was interested in joining us.  We will most likely head up
there
around 6:30ish.  Depending on how many people, I may try to get a
reservation, so let me know ASAP if you are interested in going.  If we
don't see you tomorrow, then hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

Subject: Monthly Girls Night Dinner


Jennifer mentioned we should all do dinner together once a month.  I
think
it's a great idea and would like to commit to the next date.  How about
you?
I was looking at Wednesday, November 14th.  This is definitely open to
suggestions.

Thanks!

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 

Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI: I am stuck on my last starter. 
Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty 
Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he 
is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should 
be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the 
season.

G.G.: Alexander has been a revelation in his first two 
starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to 
him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not 
be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and 
Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who 
may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker 
will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not 
destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a 
great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score 
a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a 
Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.

Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA: Should I start Rod Gardner or 
Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is 
looking better each week.

G.G.: Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains 
instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be 
geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The 
Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of 
the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is 
quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' 
No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing 
Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. 
Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with 
Hilliard because of his experience and continuing 
improvement.

John Kersey, Denver, CO: I have already decided to start 
LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - 
Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?

G.G: Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but 
the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in 
him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas 
after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a 
respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a 
Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against 
the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with 
the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.

TIP OF THE WEEK:

Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is 
a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions 
override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in 
the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the 
Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. 
And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be 
surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

THANKSGIVING FOOTBALL

Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: 
Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 
4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from 
these four teams on your roster, they must have their final 
status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of 
their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be 
able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one 
hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football 
Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner 
to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.


SORTABLE STANDINGS

Did you know that every column on your Standings page is
sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column 
to sort the report by the results of that category. In head-
to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order 
of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you 
can click the ""PF"" (Points For) column to display the top 
point-scoring teams at the top; or the ""PA"" (Points Against) 
column to display, in descending order, the teams with the 
most fantasy points scored against them.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese 
at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?

G.G. - Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries 
this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle 
injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been 
bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer 
seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But 
remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has 
never been able to string many good performances together in 
the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be 
primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by 
Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post 
respectable numbers at Dallas.

Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I 
have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest 
Holmes and Garrison Hearst.

G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is 
facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but 
will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. 
Staley should have little trouble ripping through the 
Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at 
Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, 
Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.

Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have 
Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they 
play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).

G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and 
each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. 
Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of 
a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. 
With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew 
Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New 
England QB.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not 
have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for 
people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be 
surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a 
great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a 
back like Alexander.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Spreads/Curves Status","Dave -- 

I've access to the MKM data sources and am investigating what resides there and how 
it can be requested and assembled.  I spoke to Thomas yesterday and it looks like they 
have all the ERMS curves and can convert the curve amounts into any currency so Frankie's
rate service might not be required afterall.

My hope is to use MKM to retrieve the data sets as XML, smash them together on time boundaries,
and use XSLT to peform simple math, translation and presentation functions.

I've updated Tori that I now have access to the datasource and am looking into what's 
there and how to assemble it.   Fortunately for me she's been very patient -- as I've not been 
able to provide her with an estimate yet, but will do so as soon as I understand what's all involved.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season.   ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.  </FONT>

Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.  </FONT>

The Rams' defense won't be able to stop the Tampa Bay offense from gaining yards this week so Gramatica will get a lot of opportunities to score, whether it's a field goal attempt or a point after. Expect him to make good on his opportunities. He is currently the hottest kicker in the NFL having made 19 of his last 20 attempts. Gramatica's hot streak was good enough to earn him a selection to this season's Pro Bowl team. Look for him to turn in another Pro Bowl-caliber performance against the Rams Monday and score a lot of Fantasy points for your squad. <BR>

garage sale this weekend.  So that is a good thing.  

If you want to bring your stuff by Friday evening, that might be a good plan
for us all to get things set up.  That way all we have to do saturday
morning is drag the tables out of the garage.  Also, I do not have a rack
for hanging clothes, so they will have to be folded or hung on the fence.

How about coming over friday evening around 630-7pm.  Also, if you have any
card tables, please bring them.  I have one and am borrowing two from my
parents.  But I am sure we may need a couple of more.

I bought a couple of garage sale signs on Monday and plan to put them out on
the main street, South Braeswood.  Another idea would be for us to take out
an ad in the greensheet.  Someone told me they cost around $15.  I am in the
process of getting some info as to the exact cost and will let you know when
i get the info confirmed. I am leaving that up to the majority vote as to
whether we all chip in for the add or not.  I think it may be worth it, some
people look for those adds and spend all day saturday doing garage sales.
But whatever you guys think

The hours of the Sale will be from 7am-1230ish.  I think by then whatever
doesn't sale either goes home or to goodwill.  I know some of you cant be
there all day or right at 7am, but I will need some help so let me know what
time you plan on coming over that morning.

Ok, so to summarize all my chatter, 3 questions, 1:  do we take out an ad in
the greensheet?   2: are you coming over friday to set up? and 3:  what time
will you be there on sat?

See ya

Jennifer

This must-have resource provides a virtual tour of the North American power

traders, analysts, or anyone else who wants to understand how the entire
system works.
The RDI Electric Power Atlas is a 270-page spiral-bound reference work. Each
11"" X 17"" full-color page shows these key features:

  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

Existing power plants larger than 25 megawatts, symbolized by capacity and
fuel, and labeled with operator and name.





  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

Existing and proposed transmission lines, 115 kV and above, identified by
voltage and number of lines.





  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

Substations and line taps connected to the grid at 115 kV and above.





  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

All IOU service territories.





  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

All non-IOU and municipal service territories.





  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

RTO/ISO pricing regions.





  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

Insets of 17 metropolitan areas.





  <http://public.resdata.com/htmlmail/atlas%20bullet.gif>

Megawatt Daily pricing regions.
Although it offers a highly detailed look at the electric power
infrastructure of North America, this remarkable atlas has been condensed
into a handy, portable format. It's a power supply expert's bible for
planning, analysis, and trading activity throughout the North American
continent.
Introductory price of $1,495 if purchased before November 16, 2001. That's a

Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team.

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=133230&""><B>David Boston</B></A>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego.

In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans.

><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns.

He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=1184&""><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helveti!

Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury.

He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=1011&""><B>Alex Van Pelt</B></A>, QB BUF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE!

He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=12363&""><B>Jay Fiedler</B></A>, QB MIA - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=133361&""><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=1859&""><B>James Thrash</B></A>, WR PHI - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington.

The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=1089&""><B>Ki-Jana Carter</B></A>, RB WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=1762&""><B>Isaac Byrd</B></A>, WR CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday.

Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=734&key=1191&""><B>Derrick Alexander</B></A>, WR KC - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.

"RE:","hey puddin head, congratulations!  glad to hear
everything went well with the newest kuykendall.  i'm
sure the sleep deprivation will pass... my sis has a 9
month old now and she gets a pretty regular night's
sleep now. are you back at work then?  who has the
baby during the day?  i am now in porto portugal and
if i ever see another glass of port again, i am likely
to vomit.  i hate the stuff anyways but we decided
that since we're here in porto, we gotta drink some
port.  well we spent an afternoon of tasting and the
stuff never did get bearable, even when we were
plastered.  from here i am going to make my way to
ireland to meet up with an old college friend and
maybe even trevor if he should be so lucky.  ok well
glad to hear everything is going well and that you are
back behind the enron locomotive. 

talk to you soon
andrew

little one arrives.  The weekend that it is playing there doesn't work out
for us, otherwise we would have done it then.

Subject: Anybody Interested in going to the Theatre


Ed and I are getting tickets to Tuna Christmas and wanted to know if any
of
you were interested in going with us.  Here is the scoop:

Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm

Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive
home
but the show is not coming to Houston this year.

Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good
seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit
together.

I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday,
say
by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the
play.

Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our
tickets by
tomorrow.

Jennifer

"Play Toys + Imagination = Hours of Fun","
Our play toys nurture creative spirits.

Remember what it was like to be a kid? You just couldn't 
grow up fast enough. Things haven't changed--your kids love 
to pretend they're just like you. In fact, chances are they're 
already imitating the things you do around the house. Playing 
with Dad's tools and dressing up in Mom's clothes are all a 
natural part of growing up. 

The best toys for imaginative play are ones that encourage 
kids to try out these new roles in a way that's safe and fun. 
Our Workbench Desk and Tool Kit let children pretend to fix 
things, and a Vanity Table and Makeup Kit make it fun to dress 
up for that special tea party.

Subject: Anybody Interested in going to the Theatre


Ed and I are getting tickets to Tuna Christmas and wanted to know if any of
you were interested in going with us.  Here is the scoop:

Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm

Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive home
but the show is not coming to Houston this year.

Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good
seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit together.

I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday, say
by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the
play.

Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our tickets by
tomorrow.

Jennifer

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"RE: Spreads/Curves Status","Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

"Anybody Interested in going to the Theatre","Ed and I are getting tickets to Tuna Christmas and wanted to know if any of
you were interested in going with us.  Here is the scoop:

Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm

Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive home
but the show is not coming to Houston this year.

Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good
seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit together.

I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday, say
by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the
play.

Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our tickets by
tomorrow.

Please use the web site's ""Contact Us"" link, located at the
bottom of every page, for any inquiries.


Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox 
at the end of every week, and will include news about the 
web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron 
Guru."" 


PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Subject: RE: Just curious


We just refinanced this past Monday.  We were going to do a 15 year at 6%,
but changed our minds and decided to do the 30 year again, but could only
get 6-5/8% (still much better than the 8% we had before).  We are still
going to pay on it like a 15 year mortgage, but the 30 years gives us
flexibility to make the lower payment in case of an emergency.  5.75% sounds
really good -- do you have to pay points to get it that low?  I like 15 year
loans for the interest rate, but like 30 year loans for the flexibility --
it's really a matter of personal choice.  That's why we went with the 30
year and will pay like a 15 -- it costs a little more (due to int rate) than
a straight 15 year mortgage, but is kind of an insurance policy because you
only have to pay the small 30 year payment.  Sorry to hear about the golf
membership.  I know how much you enjoyed that.  We have focused this entire
year on paying down debt, so we really haven't saved anything other than
401k and ESPP.  However, we payed off my student loans back in March and
will pay off the car next month (yeah!!).  After next month, our only debt
will be the house.

We are just glad that Tori is up this year and was up last year in her book.
Basically, her desk has agreed to put their head down and make as much money
as possible.  That way, if the axe starts falling, it falls somewhere else. 

The employees in general are disgusted with upper management and would
prefer for all of them to be replaced.  Who knows, if the stock remains too
low you would have to consider the possibility of a hostile takeover (i.e.,
GE, Exxon etc..).  All speculation of course.  In short, we have lost alot
of money and are making changes in our finances to accomodate in future
issues.  No more golf membership :(   

We are considering refinancing again at 5.75 for 15 years.  It saves us 160K
over the life of the loan.  Any thoughts on 15yr mortgages?

Not much going on.  I am hoping CPN stays low for about another 5 weeks so I
can load up with my ESPP $.  I get a 15% discount on the price on the last
day of Nov.  How are things going with Tori over at Enron -- it sounds like
they are in a bad situation over there.

Still in the process of refinancing - we should close in a couple of weeks.
Susan doesn't want to start trying for a baby until after the holidays.  The
answer to your Calpine question is a little complex, but the short and
simple answer is the following:

1.  Although there is a lot of new power coming online, most companies are
not accounting for the fact that a lot of the old generation will be
displaced by the new generation (i.e. the new generation is much cheaper to
operate, so it will ""win"" the battle in the end).

2.  New power generation has not kept up with the growth of the 80's and
90's - plain and simple, this is a fact.  However, if we go into a
long-lived recession, some of the growth will erode.

3.  A lot of the current plans for more generation will not materialize.
Many companies will shut down plans to build more generation because of
fears of over-building.  Whoever gets the new generation on the ground first
will force the other companies to back off.  In the 80's, Calpine's CEO
recognized the fact that there would be a lack of power in the US by the
late 90's and into the 2000's.  Therefore, he bought call options from the
major turbine producers (GE, Westinghouse, etc.) which gives us the rights
to a large portion of the turbines that are currently being built and will
be built over the next few years.

Jake,

What does Calpine see that the rest of the world doesn't when it comes to
power?   Calpine keeps building-out to produce more power and the so called
""experts"" indicate there is a glut of power coming out.  I don't
understand..   Any thoughts?

I heard you guys refinanced the house :).   I hope everything is going well
over at CPN.   Any new developments on the Baby front or are you guys just
still practicing :).

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"RE: Garage Sale Information","you are the first to reply. So I will let you know about the consensus on
the ad thing.  

We will probably be up around 615 on Saturday.  I don't plan on fixing
myself up for the event.  Probably just throw on some shorts and a hat.  

So if you can't make it Friday, then let me know what time you were thinking
on Saturday.  No big deal, just wanted to mention that we would be home on
friday evening for those who wanted to bring the stuff over that night.

So what all do you have for the sale??

I have a coffee table, end table, typewriter, stereo speakers and then some
other misc stuff.

Subject: Garage Sale Information


Hello All!

Just wanted to give you guys an update.  The weather looks good for the
garage sale this weekend.  So that is a good thing.  

If you want to bring your stuff by Friday evening, that might be a good
plan
for us all to get things set up.  That way all we have to do saturday
morning is drag the tables out of the garage.  Also, I do not have a
rack
for hanging clothes, so they will have to be folded or hung on the
fence.

How about coming over friday evening around 630-7pm.  Also, if you have
any
card tables, please bring them.  I have one and am borrowing two from my
parents.  But I am sure we may need a couple of more.

I bought a couple of garage sale signs on Monday and plan to put them
out on
the main street, South Braeswood.  Another idea would be for us to take
out
an ad in the greensheet.  Someone told me they cost around $15.  I am in
the
process of getting some info as to the exact cost and will let you know
when
i get the info confirmed. I am leaving that up to the majority vote as
to
whether we all chip in for the add or not.  I think it may be worth it,
some
people look for those adds and spend all day saturday doing garage
sales.
But whatever you guys think

The hours of the Sale will be from 7am-1230ish.  I think by then
whatever
doesn't sale either goes home or to goodwill.  I know some of you cant
be
there all day or right at 7am, but I will need some help so let me know
what
time you plan on coming over that morning.

Ok, so to summarize all my chatter, 3 questions, 1:  do we take out an
ad in
the greensheet?   2: are you coming over friday to set up? and 3:  what
time
will you be there on sat?

See ya

Jennifer

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 

Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA: Which two receivers should I 
start this weekend: Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris 
Carter, Terry Glenn or James McKnight? Who would you 
recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron 
Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?

G.G. - As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must-
start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch 
to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. 
Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. 
Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to 
go with Carter in this case. This season has been very 
unpredictable, so going with your most established player in 
this case is the best move. To answer your second question, 
we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense 
and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, 
but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be 
splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. 

Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL: I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye 
this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or 
picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?

G.G. - Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy 
perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be 
facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and 
vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes 
and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.

Scott Buzby, Newark, DE: Who should I start this week: 
Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop 
James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston 
and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.

G.G. - Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the 
red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the 
league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the 
tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able 
to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one 
per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good 
enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so 
his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is 
to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like 
Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving 
Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best 
offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more 
rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With 
Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will 
continue to be a productive player all season.

""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3664&key=133263&""><B>Daunte Culpepper</B></A>, QB MIN - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3664&key=1204&""><B>Curtis Conway</B></A>, WR SD - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy.

s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches.

<FONT SIZE=2>The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3664&key=1612&""><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle.

McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble.

He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3664&key=1149&""><B>Charlie Garner</B></A>, RB OAK - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sund!

He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3664&key=133361&""><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3664&key=12623&""><B>Michael Pittman</B></A>, RB ARI - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas.

While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3664&key=1003&""><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 10/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be.

 Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary.

"Re: FW: erin pics","Hey there,
Thanks for the pics.  What a cutie.  I like the first pic a lot.
I'll IM ya later on this week.  Today I started my first day at the 
Woodlands bakery.  I was up at 4am and literally rolling dough by 5:10.  
Later today I had 2 fillings done and my dentist accidentally anesthisized 
the wrong side of my mouth...TWICE...bc we got to talking about baking and 
the first round of shots wore off....then after the second round he realized 
that he was working on the wrong side.  Not good!  You should tell this to 
Phillip.  We have the same dentist.  It was actually not too bad but I'm 
super groggy.
Hope all is well at work.  I can't believe the stock price.  I almost fell 
over today when I saw it.  Unbelievable.
Take care and I'll talk to you soon.
Mo.

"RE: FW: erin pics","
Let me know if anything changes with the parental visit.  I'm sure we can
find another time.

You're right...it is rough out there on the job search front.  He's still
keeping a positive attitude though, so hopefully something will work out
soon.

I talked to Diane for a quick minute, and she said that she had a lot of
fun in Austin.  I miss Nicole!

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2762&key=1094&""><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2762&key=1184&""><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><!

Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2762&key=1234&""><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2762&key=1440&""><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Upda!

Jennifer mentioned we should all do dinner together once a month.  I think
it's a great idea and would like to commit to the next date.  How about
you?
I was looking at Wednesday, November 14th.  This is definitely open to
suggestions.

Thanks!

"Thank You","Hey Guys!

I am glad we all met up for dinner last night.  It was great getting just
the girls together.  We need to do that more often.  Maybe we can make it a
monthly deal one night during the week.  

Also, thanks for treating me to dinner for my birthday.  That was not my
intention of dinner, but I do thank all of you.  


See you all later.

Jennifer

Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=15&""><B> Dolphins</B></A>, DT MIA - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.</FONT></FONT!

He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=1032&""><B>Mark Brunell</B></A>, QB JAC - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=12753&""><B>Fred Taylor</B></A>, RB JAC - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain !
in!
 his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=2125&key=1220&""><B>Rod Smith</B></A>, WR DEN - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

"Socal Window Meeting","Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle

Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)
