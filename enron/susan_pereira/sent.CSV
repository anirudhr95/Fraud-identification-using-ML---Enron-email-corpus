"Colonial Park","Dear Mr. Farley-

I am writing to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field at Colonial Park from February through May every year.  If not allowed to use the field, WUSA will have a very difficult time finding a suitable replacement on such short notice, especially near West U.  What harm can it do to postpone the work a couple of months?  West U is a city focused on families and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space??

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira

"RE: Hello!!!","Still here, but don't know for how long...

I still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground.  Because our credit rating keeps dropping, our trading abilities are being adversely affected.  I don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate.  We may not make it to the end of the year, Dynegy deal or not.  I'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt, but if they don't, it doesn't look good....

Oh, well.  We'll all just move on and look for other jobs.  

Oh, by the way, we just moved into the new building this past weekend.  We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes.

Hope everything is going well for you.  How is your house coming along??  Send me a note back.  I'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on Monday.  They start laying off people next week.  It won't be in gas and power, but in other areas of the corporation.  Merry Christmas!!

Take care,

Susan

I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

Have a great holiday season.

Take care,

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

"Sweet Mesquite site","David-

After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.

Subject:	TGT cashout language

Susan - Here is the section of the tariff that is currently available on the TGT website that applies to our situation for October:

Customers using in-kind replacement for imbalance resolution have thirty (30) days from date of notification by Transporter to nominate and resolve their imbalances. Imbalances not resolved within this thirty (30) day period are subject to cash-out at the 5% to 10% Net Imbalance Percentage for determining the Cash-Out Index Price. The cash-out index price to be used for cash-out shall be the greater of the month in which the imbalance occurred or the month in which the imbalance is cashed out. If Customer makes a good faith effort throughout the 30 days provided for in-kind replacement of imbalance volumes, but is unable to fulfill its in-kind make-up obligations solely as a result of Texas Gas's inability to take or deliver such make-up gas, then Texas Gas will cash- out Customer's imbalance at 100% monthly average index. 

Thus for October production, since we are short gas,  the gas price would be 110% of the highest price  for October or for November.

I am going to get with Suzanne Calcagno to find out the status of the TGT tariff filings and if it is still going to be effective retro  to  October.

I would also encourage you to closely examine the proposed changes to
Colonial Park (a nuance transformation from a Community Park to a

With the YMCA coming into city ownership next year, there should be no

Susan,

I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in the
""system""  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

Thank you,

Stevens

"ENRON - A Study in How So Few Could Screw So Many","Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrence. 

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and held on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e., +/- 20%.  

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

Susan,

We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from
our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement
shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,
rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with
Tricia Truong and she suggest I speak to you.

Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?

Is something in error or has the contract changed?

Thank you,

Stevens

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

Thanks

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

"Colonial Park","Mayor Lewis-

I would like to recommend strongly that the City of West University postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  At least 50-60 girls (ages 6-8) in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park from February through May each year.  What harm can it do to postpone the work so that the girls can play there this upcoming season?  If the field is unavailable in 2002, it will be very difficult to find suitable practice sites on such short notice, especially near West U.  West U is all about family and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Russ,

Can you please remap KOCH/Zone 4 Area 3/000464 to IF-Tetco/ELA and GDP-Tetco/ELA?

This meter was remapped to this curve last month but there were many changes on the KOCH pipeline between zones on October 1st, could that be why the mapping was changed back to the original curve?

Kam

Susan, this fix can't be done until tonight as it takes overnight to take effect.  You should see the impact in tomorrow night's P&L.

Subject:	New Sweet Mesquite at existing Eckerd's site

Hi, fellow P&Z members.

I just wanted to let you know about the meeting David Moss and I had with Dan Muniza of Center America.  Sweet Mesquite restaurant is very interested in the existing Eckerd's site and is now willing to wait until next summer when Eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the property (where Weiner's is now).  Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement  along Braes for a patio area.  Currently, that area is being used for parking.  The proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.  Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts Eckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative fencing or brick.  They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc.  David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potential liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.  Also, there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to be relocated closer to the street.  I think David will be able to give us a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.  David did mention that the line is in need of replacement anyway.

As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elevations from Eckerd's yet.  He's expecting to get something this week.  He's reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing center.

Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the additional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.  Dan Muniza indicated that the parking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be available for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide open after 5 pm.

David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to discuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.  He wanted to do that prior to Comp. Plan meeting on the 30th.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

following order:

Subject:	Kindergarten teacher gifts for Christmas


Hello -
 
Part of our $15.00 homeroom fee that you paid at the beginning  of the school year is used to purchase gifts for the teachers at  Christmas.  Michael Davies encouraged the room moms to think of something  that the children could participate in and make for the teachers.  Families  are welcome to give individual gifts as well, if they want.
 
Our class will be making/painting a ceramic piece, one for  Mrs. Munford and one for Mrs. Thuot.  I am going to pick out a piece this  weekend at the Mad Potter - it will either be a platter or a flower pot that I  will then fill with a plant for each of them.  If you have any preferences  or thoughts on what our piece should be, please let me know right  away.
 
Once I pick out the piece, you will be able to take your child  to the Mad Potter, 1963A W. Gray (next to Fundamentally Toys and Mesa Grill,  just east of Shepherd).  They are open daily with hours that should be  convenient for working and non-working parents.  Their hours  are:
 
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday    11 a.m. - 10  p.m.
Tuesday                                      11  a.m. - 6 p.m.
Friday,  Saturday                           11  a.m. - 11 p.m.
Sunday                                          1 p.m. - 6  p.m.
 
Your child will put a thumbprint on each piece in the paint  color of his/her choice.  You will need to write his/her name in pencil  underneath the thumbprint and we will paint their names in before the piece is  fired.  I will make something (hopefully a dalmation) out of their  thumbprints.  If anyone is artistic and would like to help, I would welcome  their help.
 
The pieces need to be fired by Monday, December 10 in order  for me to pick them up before the class Christmas party on December  18.
 
Please plan on taking your child to the Mad Potter one  day between Monday, December 3 and Sunday, December 9 to do their  thumbprints.  You will not be charged anything, and anyone in the  studio will be able to help you.  They will have the piece and written  instructions from me, along with a list of the class members.
 
If you have any questions or comments, please call me at  713-626-9726 or email me.  I know we are all busy at this time of year, so  I appreciate your cooperation in getting this done next week.   Thanks!

TGT submitted another new filing which proposes using weekly averages in Natural Gas Week and also proposes changing the tiers.  TGT wants to implement this retroactive to October1st.   Numerous entities have filed oppositions to this proposed TGT tariff change.     So at this time,  the method to be used by TGT for cashouts is uncertain.   
I will let you know when a cashout methodology gets final approval by FERC.

"Colonial Park","Dear Mr. May-

I am writing to request that West U postpone the planned work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls (ages 6-8) involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in the park from February through May every year.  WUSA would have a very hard time finding a replacement field at this late notice, especially anything close to West U.  What harm would it do to delay the City's plans until the summer?  West U prides itself on being a city focused on community and families.  What's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to practice on public park space??

1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.


I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

OK .  The girls got their mission accomplished and they will be treated to ice cream during the 2nd half of practice Wed.
I will bring my Suburban and take them to the Baskin and Robbins in the Randall's Shopping Center at Weslayan and Bissonnet. at about 8pm and you can pick them up there at the regular time of 8:30.

If you will notice they are progressing as a team right in line with what we have been teaching them.. They learned a little individual and team defensive tactics for the lst couple of weeks, so they started holding the oppositions scoring down to reasonable levels.  The last couple of weeks we have  been working strengthening their kicks, on finishing and on working crossing passes.  They have improved in all those areas. They gave us as many thrills as the Yankees on Sunday, so they now will get their just desserts.

I am trying to arrange a makeup for next Sun. and will let you know at practice.

The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.  We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.  I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.  They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.  I don't know who has been notified.  We may all be walking out the door soon.

As for the kids, Yes, Kali still believes in Santa Claus.  I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!  We'll be here in Houston for Christmas.  Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.  

Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.  They haven't written their lists yet, though.  

We went to a dude ranch in Bandera, TX for Thanksgiving weekend.  The kids had a blast and want to go back next year.  

I guess I'll be updating my resume this weekend.  It looks pretty bleak.

hey Susan,

How is it going this week?  I heard that people are mostly sitting around

said she will be let go just before Christmas.  I can't believe how they are
laying people off just before Christmas, the whole scenerio is like a bad
movie.  She's coming to visit this week, so maybe we can cheer her up with
some Christmas shopping in Rothenburg, it's an adorable little mid-evil town
that has the greatest Christmas decoration stores ever...and they are open
year round.  We took Julie there when she was here a couple of weeks ago.

How are the kids doing?  Does Kali still believe in Santa Claus?  We are
going to spend Christmas with Melissa and family.  Christmas is just not
much fun without children to watch.  Armin needs a vacation, well we both
do.  We leave on Dec 21 and CAN'T WAIT TO GO!  Are ya'll staying home for
Christmas?

Well, just wanted to check on you!  Take care...connie

Susan, I just got an invoice from Superior for the unwinding of the Sonat trigger deal.  The invoice covers production months 12/01 through 08/02 and is for $3,761,900.00.  Have you put something in the system for this?

Thanks

   Susan,

   I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
   message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
   prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in
   the
   ""system""  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
   different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

   Thank you,

   Stevens

Can you please remap KOCH/Zone 4 Area 3/000464 to IF-Tetco/ELA and GDP-Tetco/ELA?

This meter was remapped to this curve last month but there were many changes on the KOCH pipeline between zones on October 1st, could that be why the mapping was changed back to the original curve?

Sent:	Tuesday, November 13, 2001 1:38 PM
To:	Lay, Kenneth
Subject:	ENRON - A Study in How So Few Could Screw So Many

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrence. 

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and held on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e., +/- 20%.  

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354

"RE: WOW!","Hi, Connie!!  Sorry I didn't get back to you on Friday.  Things got busy.  

The stock is still going down, but not as much.  It's at $13.92 right now, yippee!!!  I'm hoping all the skeletons are out of the closet now.  I guess I'll be working another 5 years or so -- I don't think the stock will get back to $45 or $50 until then.  There aren't any new businesses for Enron to get into to make the stock analysts excited.  All the money we're making in trading is apparently not doing it for them.  

Who knows what will happen to the executives who are still here?  It might be hard to get a concrete case against them.  I'm sure some of them are in the same boat as the rest of us.  Oh, news flash....ENE $13.80.....I think Wall Street wants Ken Lay's head on a platter.  I'm sure the stock analysts are really frustrated that Jeff Skilling isn't here anymore --- they would have gutted him.  Old Skilling is just grinning in his new River Oaks mansion.  I think I would gut him if I crossed paths with him.  I think I should sign up for anger management classes.  

As for my car purchase.... yes, I traded in my Land Cruiser for a Toyota Sequoia.  I got a really good deal on my trade-in and paid cash for the balance.  Two days later, Renato found out from his new boss that Renato's position was superfluous.  This boss is the only Entergy guy to survive the Entergy-Koch trading merger.  They put him in between Renato and his former boss, and this guy decided that they didn't need both of them.  Entergy-Koch is so small that there aren't any other comparable positions open.  The guys working for Renato are sick about it.  The upper management at Entergy-Koch has done a review of this Entergy guy since he told Renato to take a hike ---everyone, peers and employees, told management in the review process that the guy was a two-faced loser with zero personality. Of course, now, Renato has already signed off on his settlement agreement; plus, he'd never consider going back.  They are paying him through the end of the year and vesting him in all the savings plans.  They are also paying him a year's salary, and he's currently doing a consulting job for the pipeline.  He's been actively looking for a new job.  Hopefully, he'll find one, or I'll be working until I'm 70!!

Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have some good news next time.....

Dear Susan,

That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sure
hope things are going better where Renato is working!

So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big
either.  I actually love those little ""Smarts"" have you seen them, I doubt
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has more
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finished
and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seeing
a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills and
eating good!

Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell
Renato hello for me.

Take care,
Connie

I would like to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 neighborhood girls involved in West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park February through May every year.  It will be difficult for WUSA  to find an alternative site on such short notice, especially near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months?  West U prides itself on being family- and community-minded; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Oh, Susan, I can't believe that ENE is trading soooo low!  I am so sorry for
all of you there, hopefully a miracle will happen.  But you REALLY didn't
want to retire, did you?  You're WAY too young!  The bad thing about
marrying a man so much younger is, I probably won't retire until he does and
that may be awhile since we just started our own business this year and he's
only 31.  I don#t want anyone else being the CFO of MY company, but ME!  But
the good thing is having a full time cook/maid.

Well, I heard this morning that they are expecting more terrorist attacks
this week.  You all take care.  Are people that work at Enron flying as much
as they used too?

Well, I hate to hear that things are up in the air for Renato right now, but
sounds like he got a great package.  He will find something good in no time,
I'm sure..then you just have all that extra money!

We have some American guests visiting, my sister-in-law's, cousin's, 2 sons.
They are really nice guys, 19 and 21 and they have been soooo lucky with the
weather.  It's great!  Sunshine and warm, well warm for us...like 65?.  All
the leaves are turning right now, I hope the sunshine lasts a few more days.
They are off touring around town right now, there's so much to see right
here alone, then later in the week they are headed further south to see more
castles and stuff.

Well I have to go get some work done.  Hope things start looking up over
there SOON for you all!

Later,

We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from
our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement
shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,
rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with

Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?

"New Sweet Mesquite at existing Eckerd's site","Hi, fellow P&Z members.

I just wanted to let you know about the meeting David Moss and I had with Dan Muniza of Center America.  Sweet Mesquite restaurant is very interested in the existing Eckerd's site and is now willing to wait until next summer when Eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the property (where Weiner's is now).  Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement  along Braes for a patio area.  Currently, that area is being used for parking.  The proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.  Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts Eckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative fencing or brick.  They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc.  David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potential liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.  Also, there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to be relocated closer to the street.  I think David will be able to give us a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.  David did mention that the line is in need of replacement anyway.

As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elevations from Eckerd's yet.  He's expecting to get something this week.  He's reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing center.

Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the additional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.  Dan Muniza indicated that the parking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be available for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide open after 5 pm.

David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to discuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.  He wanted to do that prior to Comp. Plan meeting on the 30th.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

Have a great holiday season.

Take care,

Susan Pereira


P.S. - Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?  I don't have their email address.  Thanks.

"Colonial Park","Dear Mr. Jackson-

I am writing to request that the City of West U postpone the proposed work at Colonial Park until at least late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association  practice at the field from February through May every year.  At this late notice, it would be very difficult for WUSA to find a replacement field near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months??  West U prides itself on its focus on community and families; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira
