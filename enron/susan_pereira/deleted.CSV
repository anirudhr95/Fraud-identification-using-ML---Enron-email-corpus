FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

   Word of the Day for Monday October 15, 2001:

   tatterdemalion \tat-ur-dih-MAIL-yuhn; -MAY-lee-uhn\, noun:
   A person dressed in tattered or ragged clothing; a ragamuffin.
   adjective:
   Tattered; ragged.

     Last  time peasant blouses surfaced, in the 1960s and '70s,
     they  were part of an epidemic of Indian bedspread dresses,
     homemade  blue-jean  skirts,  Army  surplus  jackets, Greek
     bookbag   purses   and   love  beads,  the  whole  eclectic
     tatterdemalion  mix meant to express egalitarian sentiments
     and countercultural solidarity with underdogs everywhere.
     --Patricia  McLaughlin, ""The peasant look,"" [1]Philadelphia
     Inquirer Magazine, April 25, 1999

     I   was   expecting   a  wild  hair,  clanking  jewelry,  a
     tatterdemalion  velvet  cape  from  whose  folds wafted the
     scent  of incense, a house full of candles, dream catchers,
     cats, and bad art.
     --David Rakoff, [2]Fraud

     To my ear, though, the prose has the tatterdemalion feel of
     something  hooked  together  by  commas, tacked together by
     periods.
     --Brad  Leithauser,""Capturer of Hearts,"" [3]New York Times,
     April 7, 1996
     _________________________________________________________

   Tatterdemalion  derives  from  tatter  + -demalion, of unknown
   origin, though perhaps from Old French maillon, ""long clothes,
   swadding clothes"" or Italian maglia, ""undershirt.""

   Word of the Day for Monday November 19, 2001:

   redound \rih-DOWND\, intransitive verb:
   1. To have a consequence or effect.
   2. To return; to rebound; to reflect.
   3. To become added or transferred; to accrue.

     Even  if  we don't officially round them up, as we did with
     Japanese  Americans in World War II, the unofficial acts of
     meanness  and  hatred against those who look like our blood
     enemies are likely to redound to our shame.
     --William  Raspberry,  ""Worse to Come,"" [1]Washington Post,
     September 15, 2001

     Women  are so inclined to vote Democratic that a Republican
     drive  to  get out the women's vote may actually redound to
     the Democrats' advantage.
     --   Ruth   Conniff,  ""No  more  angry  feminists,""  [2]The
     Progressive, October 1, 1996

     [T]he  Kemp  Commission  tracked  three  periods of reduced
     taxation  in this century. Each was followed by an economic
     boom that redounded to the benefit of the entire society.
     --Mona  Charen,  ""You Can't Punish the Rich Without Hurting
     the  Rest  of  Us,"" [3]St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 25,
     1996

     O'Sullivan  busied  himself  writing would-be contributors,
     outlining  his  plan  for  the enterprise and how its glory
     would redound to all associated with the project.
     --Edward  L.  Widmer,  [4]Young  America:  The Flowering of
     Democracy in New York City
     _________________________________________________________

   Redound,  originally ""to be in excess or to overflow,"" derives
   from  Latin  redundare,  ""to  overflow,  to be in abundance or
   excess,"" from re- + unda, ""wave.""

"NEW WEATHER SWAPS ON THE INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE","  
[IMAGE]
IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory  with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.  
We encourage all or our users to take a serious  look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange.  Please contact one of our following representatives to find out about the new  weather products, or check back on our website product guide:

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Subject: 

I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

Have a great holiday season.

Take care,

Susan Pereira


P.S. - Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?  I don't have their email address.  Thanks.

   Word of the Day for Friday October 19, 2001:

   extemporaneous \ek-stem-puh-RAY-nee-us\, adjective:
   1.  Composed, performed, or uttered on the spur of the moment,
   or without previous study; unpremeditated; impromptu.
   2. Prepared beforehand but delivered without notes or text.
   3. Skilled at or given to extemporaneous speech.
   4. Provided, made, or put to use as an expedient; makeshift.

    . . .  the  intimate goofiness of an extemporaneous story
     told to a child.
     --Barbara  Tritel,  ""What  the Wicked Magician Did,"" [1]New
     York Times, February 22, 1987

     She  summed  up  the long and complex sessions in an hour's
     extemporaneous   speech   that   was   remarkable  for  its
     organization, pithiness and coherence.
     --""Anna Freud, Psychoanalyst, Dies in London at 86,"" [2]New
     York Times, October 10, 1982

     In  fact,  his  particular  strength  may  well  have  been
     improvisation,  and  he  may  not  have  been interested in
     committing  the  results of his extemporaneous performances
     to paper.
     --Christoph  Wolff,  [3]Johann  Sebastian Bach: The Learned
     Musician
     _________________________________________________________

   Extemporaneous comes from Late Latin extemporaneus, from Latin
   ex tempore, ""out of time,"" therefore ""immediately, at the very
   time  the  occasion  arises.""  It  is  related  to  temporary,
   ""lasting  for a limited time""; contemporary, ""belonging to the
   same  time""  (con-, ""with, together""); and tempo, ""the rate or
   degree of movement in time.""

   Word of the Day for Wednesday October 17, 2001:

   dulcet \DUHL-sit\, adjective:
   1. Pleasing to the ear; melodious; harmonious.
   2. Generally pleasing, soothing, or agreeable.
   3. (Archaic) Sweet to the taste.

     If  you want to catch up with our most famous songster, the
     nightingale,  just  visit  Minsmere at the end of April, or
     early  May,  and  stand on the edge of the car park. You'll
     soon hear the dulcet tones of the poets' favourite bird.
     --Stephen  Moss,  ""Birdwatch,"" [1]The Guardian, October 23,
     2000

     Amanda . . . rages at her young 'uns in a voice that may
     have been full of dulcet notes when she turned the heads of
     her  gentleman  callers  in  her  youth,  but has now grown
     hard-edged and ringing, like a cracked bell.
     --Hal Hinson, [2]Washington Post, November 11, 1987

     Just  as my eyelids started to get heavy and my brain began
     to  relax  its hold on wakefulness -- bam! -- the less than
     dulcet  tones  of  Britain's  top  breakfast  DJ started to
     emanate from my radio alarm.
     --""Secs in the City,"" [3]The Guardian, July 30, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Dulcet  comes  from  Old  French  doucet,  diminutive of dous,
   ""sweet,"" from Latin dulcis, ""sweet.""

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Re: FW: Way to Go, Hawks!!","Susan,

Thanks again for all your help.  This is the first team that I have ever been involved with that had the asst. coaches get to 100% of the practices. Also, thanks for standing in for me when I had to miss the last couple of games. You did a great job. Maybe if we get a Spring team we could exchange places, and you could   take over as the coach.  I would help you out when I could, and maybe Jon could, too.

I hope you,Kali, Renato and Michael have a happy Thanksgiving.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Kindergarten field trip","
We are still looking for a couple of parents to attend the  Blue Barn field trip on Tuesday, October 16.  The field trip will take up  the entire school day - from 8:00 a.m. until carpool time.  Because we had  late notice about this field trip, some of the parents who originally signed up  to go cannot attend.  It is my understanding that parents drive their own  cars, while students take school busses.  I have been told that Blue Barn  is approximately 1 hour away from the school.
 
If there is any way that you or your spouse can attend,  please email me at schick1@earthlink.net  or call me at  713-626-9726 as soon as possible.  Thank you - have a great  weekend!

   Word of the Day for Saturday October 20, 2001:

   copse \KOPS\, noun:
   A thicket or grove of small trees.

     A  lit window shone from between the trees below them, then
     vanished  again  as  the car dipped over a ditch and passed
     through a copse.
     --Kate Bingham, [1]Mummy's Legs

     Among the mountains, hills, streams, waterfalls, and little
     copses,  the  child  rejoiced in ""savouring the delights of
     freedom"" that stimulated his boyish dreams and reveries.
     --Suheil Bushrui and Joe Jenkins, [2]Kahlil Gibran: Man and
     Poet

     They  sang  freely in the copses and thickets round Bohain,
     and in the ruins of the mediaeval castle where he played as
     a boy.
     --Hilary Spurling, [3]The Unknown Matisse
     _________________________________________________________

   Copse derives from Old French copeiz, ""a thicket for cutting,""

Subject:	New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

   Word of the Day for Sunday October 14, 2001:

   disquisition \dis-kwuh-ZISH-uhn\, noun:
   A formal discourse on a subject.

     Hence,  although  the  publisher  calls Mr. Roth's work ""An
     Essay  on  Evil  in  the Modern World,"" it will be found to
     differ  materially in approach and manner of treatment from
     the usual disquisition on an ancient topic.
     --Percy   Hutchison,  ""That  Old  Arch-Enemy  of  Man,  the
     Antichrist,"" [1]New York Times, May 12, 1935

     Gore was partial to eye-glazing disquisitions on reciprocal
     trade.
     --Bill Turque, Inventing Al Gore: A Biography

     The  treatises and pamphlets of the late eighteenth century
     about the reform of commerce were considered, very soon, to
     be disquisitions of only limited and technical interest.
     --Emma Rothschild, Economic Sentiments

    . . .  a  rambling  disquisition, with copious historical
     discussion and many anecdotes.
     --James McCourt, Delancey's Way
     _________________________________________________________

   Disquisition  comes  from  Latin disquisitio, from disquirere,
   ""to  inquire  into,  to investigate,"" from dis- + quaerere ""to
   seek.""   It  is  related  to  inquire  (""to  seek  into"")  and
   exquisite,  which  describes  something  that  is ""sought out""
   (ex-, ""out"") because of beauty, delicacy, or perfection.

"Undeliverable: New Sweet Mesquite at existing Eckerd's site","
--------- Inline attachment follows ---------

From:  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPEREIR>
To: 'ev1.net,jpiper5360@aol.com' <dbland@velaw.com,lucy1>
Date: Monday, October 15, 2001 6:33:34 GMT
Subject: 

Hi, fellow P&Z members.

I just wanted to let you know about the meeting David Moss and I had with Dan Muniza of Center America.  Sweet Mesquite restaurant is very interested in the existing Eckerd's site and is now willing to wait until next summer when Eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the property (where Weiner's is now).  Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement  along Braes for a patio area.  Currently, that area is being used for parking.  The proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.  Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts Eckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative fencing or brick.  They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc.  David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potential liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.  Also, there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to be relocated closer to the street.  I think David will be able to give us a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.  David did mention that the line is in need of replacement anyway.

As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elevations from Eckerd's yet.  He's expecting to get something this week.  He's reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing center.

Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the additional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.  Dan Muniza indicated that the parking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be available for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide open after 5 pm.

David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to discuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.  He wanted to do that prior to Comp. Plan meeting on the 30th.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

   Word of the Day for Tuesday December 11, 2001:

   gambol \GAM-buhl\, intransitive verb:
   To dance and skip about in play; to frolic.

   noun:
   A skipping or leaping about in frolic.

     I've  been  told  dolphins  like  to gambol in the waves in
     these waters, and that sighting them brings good luck.
     --Barbara  Kingsolver, ""Where the Map Stopped,"" [1]New York
     Times, May 17, 1992

     The  bad  news  is that while most of us gambol in the sun,
     there will be much wringing of hands in environment-hugging
     circles about global warming and climate change.
     --Derek Brown, ""Heatwaves,"" [2]The Guardian, June 16, 2000

     Then they joined hands (it was the stranger who began it by
     catching  Martha  and  Matilda) and danced the table round,
     shaking  their  feet  and tossing their arms, the glee ever
     more  uproarious,  --  danced  until  they were breathless,
     every  one of them, save little Sammy, who was not asked to
     join  the gambol, but sat still in his chair, and seemed to
     expect no invitation.
     --Norman  Duncan,  ""Santa  Claus  At  Lonely  Cove,"" [3]The
     Atlantic, December 1903
     _________________________________________________________

   Gambol,  earlier  gambolde  or  gambalde,  comes from Medieval
   French  gambade,  ""a  leaping  or  skipping,""  from Late Latin
   gamba, ""hock (of a horse), leg,"" from Greek kampe, ""a joint or
   bend.""

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

   Word of the Day for Sunday December 9, 2001:

   foofaraw \FOO-fuh-raw\, noun:
   1. Excessive or flashy ornamentation or decoration.
   2. A fuss over a matter of little importance.

     A somber, muted descending motif opens and closes the work,
     which  is  brief  but  effective.  It  provided much needed
     relief  from the fanfares and foofaraw in which brass-going
     composers so often indulge.
     --Philip  Kennicott,  ""Brass  Spectacular is a Spectacle of
     Special  Sound,""  [1]St.  Louis  Post-Dispatch, January 17,
     1997

     After  working  in the news business for a number of years,
     I've  become  a  bit  cynical  about mass-media coverage of
     events like the Y2K foofaraw.
     --Roy  Clancy, ""Ready for Y2K...,"" [2]Calgary Sun, December
     15, 1999

     Making  the Times best-seller list, or a movie, or all that
     other  foofaraw  is  not  necessarily  proof of [a novel's]
     lasting significance.
     --Roger  K. Miller, ""'Peyton Place' was remarkably good bad
     novel,"" [3]Minneapolis Star Tribune, December 29, 1996
     _________________________________________________________

   Foofaraw is perhaps from Spanish fanfarr?n, ""a braggart.""

"AW: WOW!","Oh, Susan, I can't believe that ENE is trading soooo low!  I am so sorry for
all of you there, hopefully a miracle will happen.  But you REALLY didn't
want to retire, did you?  You're WAY too young!  The bad thing about
marrying a man so much younger is, I probably won't retire until he does and
that may be awhile since we just started our own business this year and he's
only 31.  I don#t want anyone else being the CFO of MY company, but ME!  But
the good thing is having a full time cook/maid.

Well, I heard this morning that they are expecting more terrorist attacks
this week.  You all take care.  Are people that work at Enron flying as much
as they used too?

Well, I hate to hear that things are up in the air for Renato right now, but
sounds like he got a great package.  He will find something good in no time,
I'm sure..then you just have all that extra money!

We have some American guests visiting, my sister-in-law's, cousin's, 2 sons.
They are really nice guys, 19 and 21 and they have been soooo lucky with the
weather.  It's great!  Sunshine and warm, well warm for us...like 65?.  All
the leaves are turning right now, I hope the sunshine lasts a few more days.
They are off touring around town right now, there's so much to see right
here alone, then later in the week they are headed further south to see more
castles and stuff.

Well I have to go get some work done.  Hope things start looking up over
there SOON for you all!

Later,
connie

   Word of the Day for Tuesday November 20, 2001:

   languid \LANG-gwid\, adjective:
   1.  Drooping  or flagging from or as if from exhaustion; weak;
   weary; heavy.
   2. Promoting or indicating weakness or heaviness.
   3. Slow; lacking vigor or force.

     Deliberately  languid,  slow to rise to a dignified height,
     his  handsomely  graying  wavy hair perfectly combed, Floyd
     sits  most of the day with his long legs sprawled under his
     table.
     --William S. McFeely, [1]Proximity to Death

    . . .  in  the  languid  heat  of Rome, late summer, late
     afternoon.
     --Matthew Stadler, Allan Stein

     With  their  strength,  grace,  and  endurance, [they] move
     about  naturally,  freely, at a tempo determined by climate
     and tradition, somewhat languid, unhurried, knowing one can
     never  achieve  everything  in life anyway, and besides, if
     one did, what would be left over for others?
     --Ryszard Kapuscinski, [2]The Shadow of the Sun (translated
     by Klara Glowczewska)
     _________________________________________________________

   Languid  comes  from Latin languere, ""to become faint or weak;
   to droop; to be inactive.""

   Word of the Day for Sunday October 21, 2001:

   ludic \LOO-dik\, adjective:
   Of or relating to play; characterized by play; playful.

     Um,  there's  only  one  problem:  her mother. Who, being a
     substantial executive, has a somewhat different attitude to
     the  worth  of  the  professions  than  her  wastrel, ludic
     husband.
     --Pat Kane, ""Pleasing papa,"" [1]The Guardian, July 11, 2001

     He  is  indeed the outstanding imaginative prose stylist of
     his  generation,  with  an  entirely  recognizable literary
     manner,  fizzy  and playful (I am trying to avoid the words
     ""pyrotechnic"" and ""ludic"").
     --Geoffrey  Wheatcroft,  ""What  Kingsley Can Teach Martin,""
     [2]The Atlantic, September 2000

     But  within  this  ludic tale there lurks a tragedy of love
     and  loss  that  does  not  lose  its  tenderness even when
     embedded  in  [the  author's] perpetually farcical frame of
     mind.
     --Richard   Bernstein,   ""Lalita,   Post-Modern  Object  of
     Desire,"" [3]New York Times, September 8, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Ludic derives from Latin ludus, ""play."" Ludicrous, ""amusing or
   laughable,"" shares the same root.

Subject:	System Imbalance Notice

October 24, 2001 

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive 
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of 
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective 
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional 
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent 
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to 
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further 
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its 
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently 
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers 
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to 
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits 
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may 
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies 
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

I would like to get you all set up with the RAC website (icon above).  This will enable you to see your daily VaR, drill down to VaR by risk type, by month and run VaR scenarios.

This is where we pull in our information for the VaR report we publish each morning, and with this you won't have to wait for us to publish before you can see the numbers.

Everyone has been granted access to the east desk VaR and some of you are already set up with your defaults on the website.

For those who aren't................

Copy this icon to your desktop
Once you enter the site (rac.enron.com) click on ""Market Details"" on the bottom of the list on the left
The top left box (VaR) will be where you will see the numbers each day
""Edit"" to pick your names

below are the names listed for the east desk (this will show you the total east var and break it down by trader)...identical to what we have been publishing

   Word of the Day for Sunday November 18, 2001:

   acerbic \uh-SUR-bik\, adjective:

     --Benoit  Aubin,  ""Quebec's  King of Comedy,"" [1]Maclean's,
     August 27, 2001

     Since  I  started  out  as  a writer many years ago, I have
     built a reputation as an acerbic, mean-spirited observer of
     the human condition.
     --Joe Queenan, [2]My Goodness: A Cynic's Short-Lived Search
     for Sainthood

     Joey  gained  a  reputation  as  a  smart  aleck  adept  at
     delivering acerbic one-liners.
     --""Joseph Heller, Author of 'Catch-22,' Dies at 76,"" [3]New
     York Times, December 14, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Acerbic  comes  from  Latin  acerbus,  ""bitter,  sour, severe,
   harsh.""

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

   Word of the Day for Monday October 22, 2001:

   popinjay \POP-in-jay\, noun:
   A vain and talkative person.

     One  popinjay  shrieking from the left and another from the
     right  about  last  week's  headlines  is  not the whole of
     Washington's   political   dramas.  Occasionally,  American
     politics is more complicated and more momentous.
     --R.  Emmett  Tyrrell,  Jr., ""Feds Go Drug Crazy,"" American
     Spectator, May 26, 2000

     A  writer  who  appreciates  the  seriousness of writing so
     little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally
     educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay.
     --Ernest Hemingway, [1]Death in the Afternoon

     The  dignified, high density of personality of [Clark Gable
     and   Humphrey  Bogart]  is  completely  missing  from  our
     popinjay contemporary actors.
     --Camille Paglia, [2]Salon, March 1998
     _________________________________________________________

   Popinjay  is  from  Middle  English papejay, popingay, meaning
   ""parrot,""  from  Old  French papegai, deriving ultimately from
   Arabic babagha.

Subject:	TGT - Imbalance Trade provisions

Here is the provision in the tariff for Imbalance Trading:
Subject to the provisions of Section 17.3(h) above, Customers may resolve their monthly transportation imbalances by trading their imbalance with another Customer. If requested by Customer, Texas Gas will post imbalances available for trades on its EBB. Customers trading offsetting imbalances must provide Texas Gas a notice of their agreement to trade imbalances in writing and signed by both Customers. All imbalance trades must be completed within ten (10) days of the date Texas Gas renders notice to Customer as to their monthly transportation imbalance. Customers must make-up in-kind or cash out all monthly transportation imbalances not resolved through trading in accordance with Section 4 of these General Terms and Conditions. 

Since the imbalance data sent to ENA was dated November 10th,   then it appears that TODAY would be the last day to trade this imbalance.    

STEPHANIE -- Can you verify this imbalance trading deadline with your TGT rep ?     Does TGT post the imbalance data earlier in the month on their nomination system ?    If so,  then the deadline could have already passed to trade the imbalance.

Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance


November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

   Word of the Day for Friday October 12, 2001:

   mulct \MULKT\, noun:
   A fine or penalty.
   transitive verb:
   1.  To punish for an offense or misdemeanor by imposing a fine
   or demanding a forfeiture.
   2. To obtain by fraud or deception.
   3. To defraud; to swindle.

     Officials  repaid  such  loans  by mulcting the public in a
     variety of legal and extra-legal ways.
     --William H. McNeill, [1]A World History

     The  fact  that  major corporations don't have to pay their
     own  way,  and  instead  are  able to enlist legislators to
     mulct  common  citizens  -- and businesses with more modest
     Washington  connections  --  deforms  the  entire political
     system.
     --Doug  Bandow,  ""The  Bipartisan Scandal of U.S. Corporate
     Welfare""

     [S]tate lawmakers and state courts... [have] ditched old
     common  law  rules  so  as to charge deep-pocket defendants
     with  harms that were once considered other people's fault,
     thus  making it thinkable to mulct automakers for the costs
     of drunk drivers' crashes
     --Walter Olson, ""Firing Squad,"" [2]Reason, May 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Mulct comes from Latin multa, ""a fine.""

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.

   Word of the Day for Monday December 10, 2001:

   autochthonous \aw-TOCK-thuh-nuhs\, adjective:
   1. Aboriginal; indigenous; native.
   2. Formed or originating in the place where found.

     For  cultures  are  not  monoliths.  They  are fragmentary,
     patchworks of autochthonous and foreign elements.
     --Anthony  Pagden,  ""Culture  Wars,""  [1]The  New Republic,
     November 16, 1998

     I  thought  of  the  present-day  Arcadians, autochthonous,
     sprung  from  the  very  earth on which they live, who with
     every  draught  from a stream drink up millennia of history
     and legend.
     --Zachary  Taylor, ""Hot Land, Cold Water,"" [2]The Atlantic,
     June 17, 1998
     _________________________________________________________

   Autochthonous  derives  from Greek autochthon, ""of or from the
   earth  or  land itself,"" from auto-, ""self"" + chthon, ""earth.""
   One   that  is  autochthonous  is  an  autochthon  (pronounced
   \aw-TOCK-thuhn\).

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

As such, we are seeking proposals to ""pass through"" these ""incentives"" to any person or persons who would like to ""outsource"" our sweep process.  Proposals will be accepted up until 12:00 PM today.  We reserve to right to accept all or any part of  any proposal and may or may not negotiate with one or more parties to provide the sweep service.

   Word of the Day for Tuesday October 16, 2001:

   panjandrum \pan-JAN-druhm\, noun:
   An important personage or pretentious official.

     Needless  to  say,  when  governors  and  ministers and the
     panjandrums  of  British  public life asked these appointed
     advisers and those from whose ranks they were largely drawn
     for  their  views  on democratic development, they gave the
     answers that might have been expected.
     --Christopher Patten, East and West

     And   so   I  have  appointed  myself  the  chairman,  High
     Panjandrum,   Grand   Inquisitor--and   sole  member--of  a
     grievance committee of my own making.
     --Alan K. Simpson, [1]Right in the Old Gazoo
     _________________________________________________________

   Panjandrum was coined by Samuel Foote (17201777) in a piece of
   nonsense writing:

     So  she  went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make
     an apple-pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming
     up  the  street,  pops  its  head  into the shop. ""What! No
     soap?""  So  he  died,  and she very imprudently married the
     barber:  and  there  were  present  the Picninnies, and the
     Joblillies,  and  the  Garyulies,  and the grand Panjandrum
     himself,  with the little round button at top, and they all
     fell  to  playing  the  game of catch-as-catch-can till the
     gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots.

   It  was  composed  on  the  spot  to  challenge  actor Charles
   Macklin's  claim  that  he could memorize anything. Macklin is
   said to have refused to repeat a word of it.

   Word of the Day for Monday November 26, 2001:

   malapropism \mal-uh-PROP-iz-uhm\, noun:
   The   usually  unintentionally  humorous  misuse  of  a  word,
   especially  by  confusion  with one of similar sound; also, an
   example of such misuse.

     At  15,  Rachel, the whiny would-be beauty queen who ""cares
     for  naught  but  appearances,""  can think only of what she
     misses:  the  five-day  deodorant pads she forgot to bring,
     flush  toilets, machine-washed clothes and other things, as
     she  says  with  her willful gift for malapropism, that she
     has taken ""for granite.""
     --Michiko  Kakutani,  ""'The  Poisonwood  Bible': A Family a
     Heart of Darkness,"" [1]New York Times, October 16, 1998

     He  also  had, as a former colleague puts it, ""a photogenic
     memory""--a  malapropism  that  captures  his  gift  for the
     social  side  of  life,  his Clintonian ability to remember
     names of countless people he has met only briefly.
     --Eric Pooley and S.C. Gwynne, ""How George Got His Groove,""
     [2]Time, June 21, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   A  malapropism  is  so called after Mrs. Malaprop, a character
   noted  for  her  amusing  misuse  of words in Richard Brinsley
   Sheridan's comedy [3]The Rivals.

   Word of the Day for Saturday November 24, 2001:

   forgo \for-GO\, transitive verb:
   Inflected forms: forwent, forgone, forgoing, forgoes
   To abstain from; to do without.

     This  one  has given up smoking today, I knew; that one his
     weekly  visit  to the cafe, another will forgo her favorite
     foods.
     --Joanne Harris, [1]Chocolat

     If  my  deepest  wish is to sit on a beach in Maine fishing
     for  bass,  I  might  cheerfully  forgo  stock  options  in
     Microsoft to do it.
     --Alan  Ryan,  ""It's  Not  Easy  Being  Equal,"" [2]New York
     Times, June 18, 2000

     As  much  as I wanted to forgo college and head straight to
     New  York  to  become  an  actress, my father said that all
     knowledge  would serve me and that the more I knew the more
     I could bring to my work.
     --Jane Alexander, Command Performance
     _________________________________________________________

   Forgo  derives  from  Old  English  forgan, ""to go without, to
   forgo,"" from for-, ""without"" + gan, ""to go.""

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

   Word of the Day for Thursday October 18, 2001:

   serendipity \sehr-uhn-DIP-uh-tee\, noun:
   The  faculty  or  phenomenon  of  making  fortunate accidental
   discoveries.

     Still,  I  was more subject to serendipity than I yet knew.
     Soon  risk, chance, and a letter from Sir Alun Reese-Jones,
     the Master of Trinity, my college at Cambridge, were to set
     my life on an adventurous course.
     --David Freeman, One of Us

     Yet even as I planned a rough route, leaving plenty of room
     for  serendipity,  I  was uncomfortably aware that journeys
     have a way of creating their own momentum.
     --Lesley  Hazleton,  [1]Driving  To  Detroit: An Automotive
     Odyssey

     There   again,   perhaps  because  of  serendipity,  or  an
     especially  conscientious  team  of  doctors,  it  can also
     happen  that the crucial clues are noticed and recorded for
     posterity.
     --Edward  Hooper,  [2]The River: A Journey to the Source of
     HIV and AIDS
     _________________________________________________________

   The  word  serendipity  was  formed  by  English author Horace
   Walpole (1717-1797) from Serendip (also Serendib), an old name
   for  Sri  Lanka,  in  reference  to  a Persian tale, The Three
   Princes   of   Serendip,   whose   heroes  ""discovered,  quite
   unexpectedly, great and wonderful good in the most unlikely of
   situations, places and people.""

   Serendipitous    describes   that   which   is   obtained   or
   characterized by serendipity.

"FW: Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production","All,  A fix to prevent the occurrence of deals not bridging to Sitara from EOL when deal start and end dates were not entered on EOL has been installed and tested.THANKS

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Russ,

Can you please remap KOCH/Zone 4 Area 3/000464 to IF-Tetco/ELA and GDP-Tetco/ELA?

This meter was remapped to this curve last month but there were many changes on the KOCH pipeline between zones on October 1st, could that be why the mapping was changed back to the original curve?

Kam

Susan, this fix can't be done until tonight as it takes overnight to take effect.  You should see the impact in tomorrow night's P&L.

   Word of the Day for Thursday November 22, 2001:

   repletion \rih-PLEE-shun\, noun:
   1. The condition of being completely filled or supplied.
   2. Excessive fullness, as from overeating.

     We  have  to earn silence, then, to work for it: to make it
     not an absence but a presence; not emptiness but repletion.
     --Pico  Iyer,  ""The  Eloquent  Sounds of Silence,"" [1]Time,
     January 1993

     With  distended  belly  and  bursting  waistcoat,  his eyes
     glazed  with  repletion,  he  picks listlessly at his teeth
     with a fork.
     --Kenneth  Rose,  ""Madness  of King George's son,"" [2]Daily
     Telegraph, November 14, 1998

     He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.
     --Jeff  Guinn,  ""The  Ghoul, the Bad, the Ugly,"" [3]Arizona
     Republic, June 7, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Repletion  is  derived  from Latin replere, ""to fill again, to
   fill  up,""  from  re- + plere, "" to fill."" Plenty is a related
   word.

   Word of the Day for Wednesday October 24, 2001:

   idyll \EYE-dl\, noun:
   1.  A  simple  descriptive  work,  either  in poetry or prose,
   dealing  with  simple,  rustic  life; pastoral scenes; and the
   like.
   2.  A  narrative  poem  treating  an epic, romantic, or tragic
   theme.
   3. A lighthearted carefree episode or experience.
   4. A romantic interlude.

     Sheep  are  not  the  docile,  pleasant  creatures  of  the
     pastoral idyll. Any countryman will tell you that. They are
     sly, occasionally vicious, pathologically stupid.
     --Joanne Harris, [1]Chocolat

     From  too much looking back, he was destroyed,... trying
     to  re-create  an  idyll that never truly existed except in
     his own imagination.
     --Gore Vidal, [2]The Essential Gore Vidal

     [S]he  kept  a  diary that poignantly captured the sense of
     youthful  gaiety  shattered by events suddenly intruding on
     their teenage idyll.
     --James  T.  Fisher,  Dr.  America:  The Lives of Thomas A.
     Dooley, 1927-1961

     The Guevaras' honeymoon idyll, such as it was, did not last
     long.
     --Jon Lee Anderson, [3]Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life
     _________________________________________________________

   Idyll  ultimately  derives  from  Greek  eidullion,  ""a  short
   descriptive  poem  (usually  on pastoral subjects); an idyll,""
   from  eidos,  ""that  which  is seen; form; shape; figure."" The
   adjective form is idyllic.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Russ,

Can you please remap KOCH/Zone 4 Area 3/000464 to IF-Tetco/ELA and GDP-Tetco/ELA?

This meter was remapped to this curve last month but there were many changes on the KOCH pipeline between zones on October 1st, could that be why the mapping was changed back to the original curve?

Kam

Susan, this fix can't be done until tonight as it takes overnight to take effect.  You should see the impact in tomorrow night's P&L.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the 
specified dates. 

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123 
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia 
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start 
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and 
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments 
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for 
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly 
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and 
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into 
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"remapping","Russ,

Can you please remap KOCH/Zone 4 Area 3/000464 to IF-Tetco/ELA and GDP-Tetco/ELA?

This meter was remapped to this curve last month but there were many changes on the KOCH pipeline between zones on October 1st, could that be why the mapping was changed back to the original curve?

Kam

Susan, this fix can't be done until tonight as it takes overnight to take effect.  You should see the impact in tomorrow night's P&L.

   Word of the Day for Saturday November 17, 2001:

   bibulous \BIB-yuh-luhs\, adjective:
   1.  Of,  pertaining to, marked by, or given to the consumption
   of alcoholic drink.
   2. Readily absorbing fluids or moisture.

     Vineyards  are everywhere, especially when Felix approaches
     Paris,  the  most  populous  city in Christendom -- and the
     most  bibulous  too, since lousy local wine had to be drunk
     before it turned sour in a few months.
     --Eugen  Weber, ""Renaissance Men,"" [1]New York Times, April
     13, 1997

     Ever since the joys of the fermented grape were discovered,
     the  bibulous  have  been  waking  up feeling the worse for
     wear.
     --Sally  Chatterton, ""The Daily Website: www.hungover.net,""
     [2]Independent, September 3, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Bibulous comes from Latin bibulus, from bibere, ""to drink.""

"Wed. practice/ice cream","OK .  The girls got their mission accomplished and they will be treated to ice cream during the 2nd half of practice Wed.
I will bring my Suburban and take them to the Baskin and Robbins in the Randall's Shopping Center at Weslayan and Bissonnet. at about 8pm and you can pick them up there at the regular time of 8:30.

If you will notice they are progressing as a team right in line with what we have been teaching them.. They learned a little individual and team defensive tactics for the lst couple of weeks, so they started holding the oppositions scoring down to reasonable levels.  The last couple of weeks we have  been working strengthening their kicks, on finishing and on working crossing passes.  They have improved in all those areas. They gave us as many thrills as the Yankees on Sunday, so they now will get their just desserts.

I am trying to arrange a makeup for next Sun. and will let you know at practice.

Terry Lester

Hi All--

Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Line / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding.

Transco is saying they won't implement ""prior to April 1"" but haven't decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement.  Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes.

On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more ""Transco-like"" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.  Will keep you posted.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

=============================================================================================================
TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES

Capping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval from FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply with orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practices and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 587.

According to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Line complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP01-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco's proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.

The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

On order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenue sharing.
FERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the claim that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours.

FERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tiered cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified ""why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days,"" said the
commission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that ""Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue."" But the commission went on to say that it ""may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading"" to avoid certain charges.

Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances. FERC said that ""it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded.""

=============================================================================================================
FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/low daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed during and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co. to ""remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system,"" FERC said.

To stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing
plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the applicable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commission noted that Texas Gas ""has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided.""

However, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language, the order explained that daily high/low index prices ""may unduly increase penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637.""

The order went on to say that ""a less draconian measure"" may be appropriate. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism ""that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price"" if it wanted to provide ""an incentive for shippers to remain in balance,"" FERC said.

   soi-disant \swah-dee-ZAHN\, adjective:
   Self-styled; so-called.

     The   study  exposes  most  varieties  of  'human  resource
     management'   as  a  complete  waste  oftimes  promoted  by
     soi-disant  gurus  and self-serving consultants with an eye
     for a quick buck.
     --""Support  for an old-fashioned view,"" [1]Independent, May
     12, 1994

     The  troupe, soi-disant egalitarians, mostly turn out to be
     royal phonies.
     --Craig Offman, ""Whiz Kid,"" [2]Time, February 1, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Soi-disant  comes  from  the  French,  from  soi,  ""oneself"" +
