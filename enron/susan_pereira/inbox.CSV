It is my understanding that Enron will not be receiving gas on Destin
pipeline in the month of December.  Therefore we have made arrangements to
sale the gas to another party.  If I have misunderstood the situation,
please advise.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Morning!","Dear Susan,

Well how's it going now?  Have they formed a salvage plan for the company?

I heard that Cuba Waddlington past away.  He had bone cancer?  I'm very
sorry to hear that, he wasn't so old either.  Was he still Frank's boss?
What's with Frank these days?  And Karen?

It's sooooo cold here!  The high maybe 32? F, MAYBE.  So, I am freezing to
death!  I've been staying in mostly, decorating and wrapping presents.  I
love this time of year!  I have been making Christmas gift baskets (filled
with wine, candies and chocolates) for our important clients and business
partners.  They look so nice sitting all around our office that I don't want
to give them away.  I bought little boxes of chocolates filled with schnapps
for the delivery people and postmen.  When you have kids, you get your
fullfillment of wrapping and giving, but when you don't, you have to focus
that energy somewhere!  We have hung icycle lights inside and out, the
germans make some that are like a meter long...we hung them inside, from the
galary and upper floor of the foyer, then hung american icycle lights (they
are much brighter) that Julie sent us outside.  It's so festive.  Are your
kids getting excited?  Kids make Christmas.  (It looks like we MIGHT have a
new baby by the end of the year, afterall.  Melissa's doctor is thinking
that his first due date, Dec 31, could be right on target!  WE HOPE SOOO!)

Hope that you and your family are all doing well.  And I hope that you are
able to get into the Christmas spirit, in spite of all that's been
happening.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
Connie

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
I'll let you know what I find.

"TGT cashout language","Susan - Here is the section of the tariff that is currently available on the TGT website that applies to our situation for October:

Customers using in-kind replacement for imbalance resolution have thirty (30) days from date of notification by Transporter to nominate and resolve their imbalances. Imbalances not resolved within this thirty (30) day period are subject to cash-out at the 5% to 10% Net Imbalance Percentage for determining the Cash-Out Index Price. The cash-out index price to be used for cash-out shall be the greater of the month in which the imbalance occurred or the month in which the imbalance is cashed out. If Customer makes a good faith effort throughout the 30 days provided for in-kind replacement of imbalance volumes, but is unable to fulfill its in-kind make-up obligations solely as a result of Texas Gas's inability to take or deliver such make-up gas, then Texas Gas will cash- out Customer's imbalance at 100% monthly average index. 

Thus for October production, since we are short gas,  the gas price would be 110% of the highest price  for October or for November.

I am going to get with Suzanne Calcagno to find out the status of the TGT tariff filings and if it is still going to be effective retro  to  October.

"Contract Price for Bazor Ridge Enron Contract 96045124","Susan,

We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from
our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement
shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,
rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with
Tricia Truong and she suggest I speak to you.

Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?

Is something in error or has the contract changed?

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001

"AW: WOW!","Dear Susan,

That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sure
hope things are going better where Renato is working!

So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big
either.  I actually love those little ""Smarts"" have you seen them, I doubt
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has more
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finished
and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seeing
a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills and
eating good!

Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell
Renato hello for me.

Take care,
Connie

"Kindergarten teacher gifts for Christmas","
Hello -
 
Part of our $15.00 homeroom fee that you paid at the beginning  of the school year is used to purchase gifts for the teachers at  Christmas.  Michael Davies encouraged the room moms to think of something  that the children could participate in and make for the teachers.  Families  are welcome to give individual gifts as well, if they want.
 
Our class will be making/painting a ceramic piece, one for  Mrs. Munford and one for Mrs. Thuot.  I am going to pick out a piece this  weekend at the Mad Potter - it will either be a platter or a flower pot that I  will then fill with a plant for each of them.  If you have any preferences  or thoughts on what our piece should be, please let me know right  away.
 
Once I pick out the piece, you will be able to take your child  to the Mad Potter, 1963A W. Gray (next to Fundamentally Toys and Mesa Grill,  just east of Shepherd).  They are open daily with hours that should be  convenient for working and non-working parents.  Their hours  are:
 
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday    11 a.m. - 10  p.m.
Tuesday                                      11  a.m. - 6 p.m.
Friday,  Saturday                           11  a.m. - 11 p.m.
Sunday                                          1 p.m. - 6  p.m.
 
Your child will put a thumbprint on each piece in the paint  color of his/her choice.  You will need to write his/her name in pencil  underneath the thumbprint and we will paint their names in before the piece is  fired.  I will make something (hopefully a dalmation) out of their  thumbprints.  If anyone is artistic and would like to help, I would welcome  their help.
 
The pieces need to be fired by Monday, December 10 in order  for me to pick them up before the class Christmas party on December  18.
 
Please plan on taking your child to the Mad Potter one  day between Monday, December 3 and Sunday, December 9 to do their  thumbprints.  You will not be charged anything, and anyone in the  studio will be able to help you.  They will have the piece and written  instructions from me, along with a list of the class members.
 
If you have any questions or comments, please call me at  713-626-9726 or email me.  I know we are all busy at this time of year, so  I appreciate your cooperation in getting this done next week.   Thanks!

"TGT - Imbalance Trade provisions","Here is the provision in the tariff for Imbalance Trading:
Subject to the provisions of Section 17.3(h) above, Customers may resolve their monthly transportation imbalances by trading their imbalance with another Customer. If requested by Customer, Texas Gas will post imbalances available for trades on its EBB. Customers trading offsetting imbalances must provide Texas Gas a notice of their agreement to trade imbalances in writing and signed by both Customers. All imbalance trades must be completed within ten (10) days of the date Texas Gas renders notice to Customer as to their monthly transportation imbalance. Customers must make-up in-kind or cash out all monthly transportation imbalances not resolved through trading in accordance with Section 4 of these General Terms and Conditions. 

Since the imbalance data sent to ENA was dated November 10th,   then it appears that TODAY would be the last day to trade this imbalance.    

STEPHANIE -- Can you verify this imbalance trading deadline with your TGT rep ?     Does TGT post the imbalance data earlier in the month on their nomination system ?    If so,  then the deadline could have already passed to trade the imbalance.

"RE: August Sonat","Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

"Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14","Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Laurie-

No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.  I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term  of the existing sitara ticket.  I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.  You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.  Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.  The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.  Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
