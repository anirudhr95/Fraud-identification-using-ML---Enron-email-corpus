Errol,

Do you know if the trade below Frank is talking about was booked to NGI-Malin or to another curve.  His concern is that there isn't a volatility curve set and the P&L/Positions may be off.

Bharat was digging around in ERMS and noticed that NGI-Malin is missing a vol curve.. 
The immediate concern was gas VAR, and think I'm, okay given below?
The second concern is Larry May.
Larry booked $8MM last week on SoCal option trade.  The question I have is where is his vol curve?  How can he book $8MM when he isn't even posting a vol curve for Malin?was his trade elsewhere
Can you all noodle around for me?
Thanks
Frank

Frank,

For all gas basis curves, if it does not have its own vol, then NG Nymex Vol will be used.

Winston,
Bharat meet with Francis Lim regarding ERMS and he learned that NGI-MALIN does not have any vol curve assigned to it.  However when we simulate that curve in ad hoc we don't get any errors.  Can you tell us what vol curve is being used for NGI-Malin in risk trac?
Thanks

Subject:	Adjusting a Warning Screen for traders.
When:	Monday, October 29, 2001 1:30 PM-2:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where:	

A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?

Thank you in advance.

From Tammy Shepperd.... Asst's Please communicate the information below to your groups and remind them also, to make sure that 
their desks are completely cleaned out, in preparation of those who will move behind them.  There should be NOTHING left in our areas
once we have been moved.  

Thank you, Heather Choate 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

After we spoke tonite, I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week.  This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03.  A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal.  Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss.  I apologize for the error.  We just found it today, when Derek was catching up from being out on Th & Fri.

Hi Errol, 

We're trying to generate our executive reports for Power positions from EnPower directly (trying to avoid using multiple spreadsheets). For the Financial group's power positions, I'm using the GASPOW portfolio in Enpower. For effective date 10/24, the query returned the numbers below for Peak and Off-Peak, respectively. Please confirm that these are correct and that these numbers capture all of your traders' positions.

They might need to be on inexact for basis and index.
Once those are done, can you email the id #'s to John Powell, Debbie Brackett and Stephanie McGinnis?

Thanks

Kam

Subject:	PortCalc Stage Release 10/29/2001 Version 4.2.1s1

Dear All,

Please test the Stage Release of PortCalc version 4.2.1s1 and let us know of the results.  

The executable is      /stage/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr        

	New Features:

Version 4.2.1s1

Changes Affecting All:

Asian strip

Fixed the Curve shift numbers in the adhoc table.

Index Option

Break up one single adhoc record into two records for physical and financial.

Basis Option

Fixed the issue on the break down of Peak and Off Peak curve shift for the second delivery point.

Performance Improvement

Disable unnecessary sensitivity calculation to improve performance typical for hourly options.

Cross Portfolio flag form deal entry is now used. Before this change, PortCalc used to determine which deal is cross portfolio using internal logic.

Curve and Position Manager

PortCalc will now populate the peak_hours_num, off_peak_hours_num, sun_peak_hours_num and sat_peak_hours_num columns in the adhoc table to provde volumetric information for the Curve and Position Manager.


Changes Affecting Australia:

Asian strip

Always use curve price for effective date to avoid next-day financial true up for that day, so that current previous day value can tie up yesterday's value.

SRA

	New Deal type.


Changes Affecting VATR:

Populate the INSTR_TYPE_CD as TRANSMISSION in the pwr_vatr_port_posn  table for Transmission deals.


Please do not hesitate to ask if there is any questions.

	Thanks,


Norman.

Subject:	Adjusting a Warning Screen for traders.
When:	Monday, October 29, 2001 1:30 PM-2:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where:	

A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?

Thank you in advance.

Errol,

Is a Macro problem your final answer on this??

I need an answer on this. If the beginning balances were changed in error, please let me know this so I can determine what I need to do to fix this variance. Again, this change did not affect your P&L.

In the January 2001 PG book DPR, for the EOL Gas Daily Roll, you reduced your beginning Gross Balance for January by $9,066,220 and you increased your beginning Liquidated Balance for January by $9,066,220. So, the EOL Gas Daily Roll stayed flat in total and did not cause a problem P&L wise. However, this amount is falling out on my reconciliation for January. Could you please tell me what deal or deals were liquidated for $9,066,220, which in turn caused a reduction in your MTM?? We are concerned that these may be third party deals that Financial Settlements are not aware of.

Thanks!!

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"RE: Lunch","I am sorry.  I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.  That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.  I feel awful now.  I thought it would be fun.  We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.

Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.

Your resume looks good.  You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.

I actually wanted to discuss what opportunities are open in your area, as well.  I'd prefer to discuss this, for now, with just yourself.  Meliza had actually mentioned it earlier , that I should talk with you, so maybe we can casually discuss it during lunch.  I know that being in your area is quite demanding on your personal time, and I have 2 year old.  But I have strong background and I am just curious as to what else is out there.  This group is ok, but I am not being fully utilized.  I will attach my resume, for your review.

Thanks again for agreeing to sit me with.  It's getting pretty tight around here!!!

If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.  Please let me know either way if any of these are your books so that I won't harass you anymore!  I need a response ASAP.

I appreciate your help!  Thanks,

Jeff, 

Can you take this over for me?  There is a deal with Procter & Gamble that Troy Black originated.  It was booked as a sale with ENA but should be in the EES books.  According to Mark Breese ENA should be kept whole, to the mids only, not against offers.  There were also hedges on the volumes that need to be moved as well.  I have asked Troy and Derek Baily about these hedges and they don't know anything about it.  I doubt that a hedge was done specifically for these deals so we may have to get bids/offers to fill the position that is left when the deals are moved to EES.  Can you get with Derek Baily and take care of this today?

Thanks

Errol,

We think that we have discovered an error in the system.  Elena has been valuing the San Diego Gas & Electric position.  It looks as if the mid for Dec 01 NGI Socal is in the system as $-.046.  The actual index however was $2.27.  Could you or someone in your group pls look into this and let us know asap.  We need to value this deal correctly so that we can unwind it.

Dear all-

Could you all please review the attached list and see if these are any of your books (or if you know anything about them)?  If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.  Please let me know either way if any of these are your books so that I won't harass you anymore!  I need a response ASAP.

I appreciate your help!  Thanks,

Christy

"RE: CES Trades","Kam,

I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co.  I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet, and they look like normal swaps.  No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature, so I can't see any reason they have not to pay.

Let me know how I can help.

Errol,

Apparently CES has stopped paying us for the attached deals.  Michelle Stevens in financial settlements is wondering if all CES trades were sold off  to The New Power Company but I have no idea if that's true.  Do you know anything about this?  The bottom 5 trades are in your books.

Let me know if you know more about CES.

The day after Thanksgiving is NXB4.  We (Price-Desk) have some special procedures we have to follow regarding swaption expiration.  Other than that, it should not be that different from a non-bidweeek day.  I apologize, I thought the 23rd was going to be NXB3.

In December, the day after Christmas (Wednesday) is NXB2 and the Friday before that is NXB3.  Monday and Tuesday are exchange holidays.

After speaking with Enpower IT, I was informed there were 2 calcs performed for Lavo's power books yesterday.

14370 - 4:11 PM (officialized)
14378 - 4:17 PM (not officialized)

14370 didn't have the positions, therefore, nothing is being picked up in RiskTrac. 14378 had the positions, but it was not saved as officialized, so RiskTrac is not picking it up as well.

We need to have 14378 saved as official so RiskTrac can pick up the positions.
Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Subject:	Let's try this one more time

Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.  I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:
Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight, sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.  Thanks for your help in eliminating this in the future.

I have saved a DPR, in the regions path, for the NG Gas Deferred for 10/01. Please save the file NGDKRS1001good, as your file for the NGDKRS1001. I had to change your beginning balances for 10/01 to tie to your ending balances for 09/01 and I changed your gross book balance so that it ties to the value in Schedule C. These changes, however, did not change your P&L for the month.

We have a request from AA.  I listed the books involved in this attachment.  I have asked Kim Theriot group to provide some of the confirmation information or whatever they can get us.  

We need:
deal tickets
print out of curve strip (curve fetch)
global counterparty database print screen
new deal forward detail

Per Jeff we need to get this back to them today.

You can drop me off a copy of your deals and I'll coordinate with AA.

Thanks

Kam

Errol,

Do you know if the trade below Frank is talking about was booked to NGI-Malin or to another curve.  His concern is that there isn't a volatility curve set and the P&L/Positions may be off.

Bharat was digging around in ERMS and noticed that NGI-Malin is missing a vol curve.. 
The immediate concern was gas VAR, and think I'm, okay given below?
The second concern is Larry May.
Larry booked $8MM last week on SoCal option trade.  The question I have is where is his vol curve?  How can he book $8MM when he isn't even posting a vol curve for Malin?was his trade elsewhere
Can you all noodle around for me?
Thanks

For all gas basis curves, if it does not have its own vol, then NG Nymex Vol will be used.

Winston,
Bharat meet with Francis Lim regarding ERMS and he learned that NGI-MALIN does not have any vol curve assigned to it.  However when we simulate that curve in ad hoc we don't get any errors.  Can you tell us what vol curve is being used for NGI-Malin in risk trac?
Thanks

All, the numbers below are from EnPower Adhoc (commodity only and without ancillary curve positions) for EOD 10/26. Please confirm if these are consistent with your reports -- we want to be able to use these numbers for the DPR.

Also note, these do not include positions outside EnPower; I'll pull those spreadsheet positions from RiskTrac.

Thanks.

Errol,

We think that we have discovered an error in the system.  Elena has been valuing the San Diego Gas & Electric position.  It looks as if the mid for Dec 01 NGI Socal is in the system as $-.046.  The actual index however was $2.27.  Could you or someone in your group pls look into this and let us know asap.  We need to value this deal correctly so that we can unwind it.

Thanks,
Craig

Hey guys,
 
I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder to please have someone go through all your books to look for any deals with ECC and a third counterparty for October and November 2001 production.  I'll try to find as many as I can, but I'm not as familiar with all of your books as you are, and I don't want any deals to be missed.  If you come across any deals can you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible as there are only a couple more days left this month, and settlements needs to get started on invoicing.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions on this.
 
Thanks
Stacey
