"Re: AW: AW: I am sooo sorry...","Well, I think for now that he's not wanting to be in a serious relationship.  I don't think he ever really did, but we just ended up having one.  But I think he's got alot of other stuff going on in his life now with job and friends and feels that he can't be committed to a relationship and knows he's not going to make the effort.  I don't know if that will change anytime soon or not.  I'm assuming it won't, but hoping it will.  Anyway, I'm just super-depressed now and my birthday is tomorrow!  This will not be a birthday to remember.  :(  I really wasn't ready for our relationship to end, and didn't think it was about to, really.  So, I have to deal with the shock as well as the sadness.  I'm going to talk to him tonight about a couple of things, but if nothing is different today, I guess we'll just leave each other alone for a while and see what happens.

Scott, 

I just wanted to inform you that Vineyard Oil and Gas has not paid this deal for March 2001 production.  I have made several calls to speak with the lady in charge of payables.  They tell me she is never in the office, and there is no one else that is handling her duties.  I was wondering if you can speak to the trader/your contact there, so I can get this issue resolved.

Thanks,
Shielah

Actually, they reacted very well - or at least as well as can be expected.  They were sad, but not horrified or anything.  They respect me and know that it's not a choice.  It was just so weird, because I did not have any agenda or intention on telling them that at that point, we were just talking about stuff (and drinking) and I just told them.  And I told them, you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no.  They had questioned it before, but had not wanted to offend me by asking.  At the same time, they were holding out hope that it wasn't true.  But now they know.  They didn't really have alot of questions or anything, but were just accepting of it.  I'm very happy to have it off my chest.

Sorry to hear about your stomach!!!  That doesn't sound fun at all.  I had a pretty bad hangover yesterday, because I drank profusely before durning and after the whole outing myself to my parents ordeal.

Scott""

So, maybe you already read that.  Anyway, is Armin getting alzheimers???  I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I actually have a couple of dates, but nothing major.  I've made a couple of new friends, so I want to continue to cultivate those sort of relationships...if other types come up that's fine, but I'm not really concentrating on it.  But I had to go out and tell a couple of my new friends about my revelation to my parents.  A couple of them have not done it themselves, so everybody's all proud of me and stuff.  It's kinda funny really.  But it's like the one thing that was always your biggest concern just isn't there anymore.  I hope it was the right thing to do, but I feel like it was.  Hard to say whether it was good or bad for my mom.  But, honesty is the best policy, right?

Subject:	AW: Morning!


It was so good to get your email and to hear that you are at least doing ""ok"".
I still hope I can meet Rayfael when I come to Houston this summer.  He sounds
really wonderful and good for you.  Hopefully he will get over this rough spell
he's going through and realize what a catch you are!  I think that is a GREAT
idea about the dogs, if ya'll get back together.  They would love doggie day 
care and be soooo tired at night that they would sleep like logs in their little
doghouses.

I am so glad to hear that your parents are traveling.  what a beautiful time
to visit New England..did they drive or fly?

Things are fine here, the house is coming along now and we talked to a
landscaper about setting up our acre of yard...hopefully that will happen in
the next couple of weeks...WE NEED GRASS THIS YEAR!!!  We spent most of the
weekend with Christina and Mitch, they are transferred back to the states in
a month....we are all depressed about that, they love it here and don't want
to go...but when the military says JUMP, what else can you do???  We all
grilled out Sat with Lolo and family, he has his garten looking so?? fine
(we all are shocked at what he has been capable of...he built a wooden deck,
edged it in stone, filled the whole yard with dirt, planted a full yard of
shrubs, etc...THEN he layed a stone driveway and walk way...IT'S
BEAUTIFUL!!!

Then on Sun Christina, Mitch and us went to A?manns for lunch and started
having aperitiffs..they were so good and we were IN THE MOOD..so we had
more, then Herr A?mann treated us all to our favorite schnapps!  We were
feeling good by the time we left to go to our building and have MARGARITA'S
AND WINE!!! After sunning and drinking all day we feasted on a fleisch
dinner...that was all we had here to eat, so we grilled bauchfleisch, steaks
and bratw?rst...WE ATE SOOO MUCH, but we had DRANK SO MUCH THAT WE NEEDED
IT, good greasy stuff.  They left about 8pm and we went home to bed.  GREAT
DAY!  Wish so bad you could've been here!!!!

Today I worked all morning in the office, went home for lunch and we ate
outside on the terrace, then came back to the office and slept in my lounge
chair (with Angus in my lap) until Claudia woke me at 4 pm!  Just in time
for an appointment I had with one of our vendors over some bills.  the
appointment went well, we went home for dinner that Claudia made and now we
are back here at the office.  Armin has a bid to get out and Angus needed to
walk and visit with his dog friends, since he slept alllll afternoon!

Well, Armin says he's getting finished, so I better go water my flowers
outside before he's ready to head home...write me, write me...WRITE ME!!!
Connie

"Re: Morning!","No, I didn't see my mom for Mother's Day because they left early Sunday morning to go to New England for about 10 days.  So, I'm glad that they feel okay to travel!  We'll do something after they get back to celebrate both my birthday and Mother's Day.

My weekend was fine.  I didn't do anything exciting....didn't really feel like going out.  I did run both days and am starting back at the gym today so I can become superbuff.  I've lost 6 lbs during this whole thing at least.  Just 9 more lbs to my goal of 140.  I saw Rayfael Friday when he came over to bring me a birthday present (he didn't think I was home!)  Then I took him some stuff that was at my house yesterday and we hung out a little bit.  I'm still hoping there's a chance we can get back together, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.  He definitely needs some time to himself and to get over this bout of depression.  I just hope that if he does, then he wants to get back together then, but I'm not sure he does.  We'll see.  I'm not interested in seeing anyone else right away, so I guess I can afford to give it a little time.  Can you put a spell on him?  hehehe

Of course, if we do get back together, that's bad news for the puppies.  If it did come to that, though, I would take them to doggie daycare during the day and they could stay outside at night - that wouldn't be so bad and they wouldn't be lonely.  Anyway, that's a BIG IF that I really shouldn't be concentrating on...so there.

How are things in Germany?  How was your trip to London?  I saw Heather in the elevator here last week, but I didn't get a chance to talk to her.

Write back!!!

Subject:	FW: FW: BIG CAT!!!


Even if you don't have time to read the story below definitely check out the
photo at the end.  That is one DAMN BIG feline!


Now this is a Big Cat!

Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River. The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around the old labs, abandoned since the late 50's. With the help of his tuna  sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could  pick them up. A self described animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the local Humane Society. Later that evening his wife Louise and their two children came to a family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found.  Lost was a female and Found was a male. When nature finally took its course, a litter of kittens was born 6 years later. One of the litter was a big white female with unique black markings on her side and tail.

Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family, and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere, Snowball stayed with the Degagne's.  In her 9 years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball.  Put simply, Snowball is no ordinary cat -- she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87 lbs.  She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing.  She always meowed for more food and would climb up on the counter to eat food which I forgot to cover.  Chicken is her favorite. 

""Once I left a cooked chicken on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic, an hour later the chicken was gone,"" Louise said. We knew that snowball wasn't your average cat when the neighbor's German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her.  She just isn't afraid of any animals.  After we found a half eaten raccoon out by the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in. We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard, we couldn't keep raccoons from Snowball.  ""At least it kept the food bills down,"" Rodger laughed. ""Like all female cats she is very territorial, but with us she is just a big ole kitten,"" he said.
				
So what does a 87 pound cat eat? Snowball goes through about 3 lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken, supplemented with deer and moose that Rodger hunts in the fall.  She likes Pike a lot, so I don 't throw them back any more.  Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight.  So what do the Degagne's attribute Snowball's size to?  Rodger says ""Well,the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat, she's just a real big cat. I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they shouldn't have.""
				
NOW go have a look at ""Snowball.""

actually live on their land hasn't even started building yet.  They gave us
their plans for approval last week and they are building their house around
an atrium like area...so they won't even have any windows this way!

I needed something uplifting..I just finished calculating how much we pay

I'm paying the price now though.  But I had a really good time and kept very busy :).  I've been two times to your house so far.  Everything seems fine.  I saw Ellie the first time - pigging out on the canned food.  Didn't see Frankie, but I didn't look either.  The weather here has been very hot, but sunny.

Sounds like Prague is treating you well.  Is it beautiful?  Tell Peggy I'm not spreading myself TOO THIN...but remember, you can never be too thin or too rich!!!  I can't believe the prices.  And if you get me something that costs 20 cents you better get alot of them!!!  HEHEHEHE

I'll go to your house again on Wednesday before you get back on Thursday.  Sadly, the Tsunami has not been used - although there were opportunities!!!  hehehehe

Miss you!  Hurry back!

Depends on how long before I really feel the need :).  Actually, I'm more interested in just making some new friends right now.  I've decided I need a few gay friends to hang out with.  That will get me out meeting more people for other stuff too.

Yeah, mom and dad got back over the weekend.  They had a good time, sounds like they did nothing but shop!  She's been going to MD Anderson for a while now.  In fact they did bloodwork yesterday and she goes in to see the doctor today.  Anyway, that's the scoop from this side of the Atlantic....

"Howdy!","Guten Morgen!!!

How was your weekend?  We had the long Memorial Day weekend here....hahaha!

Things are fine here.  I just tried to relax this weekend.  Friday night I went to a movie with Rayfael. We saw Angel Eyes with Jennifer Lopez.  It was pretty good.  Saturday, I pretty much just vegged out a good chunk of the day.  Julie and I went to lunch and ran errands.  I went running every day this weekend, too!  I've lost 10 lbs since the big breakup!!!  Down to 145 now, may go for 140 - not sure.  I didn't go out on Saturday because I was just in a mood to stay in.  Sunday, I took care of some stuff around the house.  I wasn't really planning to go out, but one of my new friends, Kevin, called and wanted me to meet him and some other folks out at a bar, so I went at about 9:00.  Well, you know how 1 or 2 drinks always turns into alot more...I ended up staying there pretty late and having a good time.  I crashed at Kevin's house and got back to mine at about 7:00 am.  So all the work I'd done on getting caught up on sleep was ruined!!!  I came home and got right in bed, but the dogs really wouldn't let me sleep much.  I went over to Julie's yesterday to get instructions on taking care of her cats this week.  She leaves Wednesday for Prague and gets back next Thursday.

Now it's back to work, but it's a short week at least.  I'm getting more and more used to the fact that I'm single now, and even though I'd like me and Rayfael to get back together - it's nothing I'm gonna be able to push, if it happens, it happens.  I really hope it does, but the best thing for me is not to push it.  So, in the meantime, I guess I'm a free agent!  That feels weird...but, oh well.

Anyway, how are things there?

"Re: Morning!","I dunno what's going on there...the board gave approval to pull out of the deal, but I think that was just a threat.  I think we must be staying in the deal.  But our stock price is not so great right now.  There was an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE article about Enron in Bloomberg Markets magazine.  It basically said we were a house of cards and lied about all our earnings expectations from new businesses.  It was very unflattering.  That came out yesterday, I think.  If I could find it in an electronic format, I'd send it to you, but I only have it on paper....

Enjoy your sun!  It's been pretty rainy and nasty here the last few days, but that's good for the yard.  Don't forget that my birthday is Friday!  I need a present from you!!!  hehehe

It's like he's building up an immunity to the allergy medicine.  He's just miserable anytime he's at the house - obviously, that doesn't help a relationship.  So, starting tonight (?) they are going to move outside.  I'm gonna have to get them one or two (probably one) doghouse.  I'm so depressed about the whole thing.  Rayfael feels bad too, but it's important he not be near death anytime we're together.  He feels like the bad guy.  And I feel like a bad father!!!  I can't bear to think of their cute little faces staring in the french doors wondering what they did wrong!

I'm getting paid back for all the nasty things I said about Barbara Dillard and her dogs!!!  I want  you to move back and let Mr. Bean and Greta live with you and Angus!!!  Nextdoor!!!  (the house is still for sale! - $269,000 list now, down from $314,000).

They are opening a Freebird World Burrito here next to that Le Peep that
we've eaten at - across from 59 Diner.  Jealous much?

"Re: AW: I am sooo sorry...","I hope it's not really over, but i think it is, at least for now.  I'm very, very sad.  I don't want to be at work, but I might as well be here and depressed and somewhat busy, rather than at home and depressed with nothing to divert my attention.  At least the doggies still love me!

"RE: How to get emails....","But I'm super busy in the mornings trading, so I can't write much....I can barely even catch my breath in the mornings!!!  Especially today because I just turned my alarm off for some reason this morning rather than getting up when it went off.  So, I woke up later and made it to work in like 15 minutes....showered, shaved, clothed and all.  But I'm not quite all here.  I had my front door refinished yesterday (which it REALLY needed - and it looks great now!), and I think the fumes all went upstairs to my bedroom and gave me brain damage and made me want to sleep!  I promise I'll write more in a bit after trading slows down....

You know, you have to WRITE emails to GET emails...and I would hardly call
your last two, WRITING..they were just acknowlegements of your existence,
not your normal informative form of communication.

WELL????

"Re: AW: Morning!","Well, sounds like everything is great in Germany!  You still didn't tell me about your trip to London?

I'm still doing just ""ok"".  The busier I am, the better I am, so I'm trying to keep as busy as possible.

If I wasn't poor and worried about my JOB right now, I'd schedule a trip to come see you, but I have to see how things shake out here.  I need to make some money quick!!!  And yesterday didn't help!  I need a vacation!!!  You guys MUST come stay with me at some point while you're here, and I wanna have a party one night while you're here.

Well, trading's getting busy....write back and I'll write more later!

"Larry's on the Loose!!!","

          Panic-Hit City Hunts 'Ape-Like' Attacker    NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Fear gripped some suburbs of the Indian capital on Tuesday after dozens of residents reported attacks by an ape-like creature able to leap from roof to roof.  Police had received about 65 reports of a mysterious attacker with a monkey's face and human body scratching and biting victims in and around Delhi since Saturday, a senior police official told Reuters on Tuesday.  Police said they had no clues about the identity of the alleged attacker.  ""Last night (Monday) alone we received 24 calls reporting such attacks,"" Manoj Lal, Deputy Commissioner of Police of Delhi's eastern district, told Reuters. ""Of these, 19 were found to have no basis. The five others had some wounds and we are trying to confirm with doctors how they may have been caused,"" he said.  Television network Star News said people in neighboring Ghaziabad town -- which reported the first attack two weeks ago -- spent the night on the streets armed with sticks waiting for the attacker.  Lal said the entire eastern district police force of about 3,000 personnel had been on patrol since Monday to hunt down the creature.  The Times of India said an industrial worker died on Sunday night in nearby Noida town when he jumped off a first-floor building after being awoken by cries the ""monkey man"" was attacking.  There are a number of monkeys running wild in New Delhi and on the outskirts of the city which sometimes pounce on unsuspecting pedestrians or enter houses.  Copyright 2001 Reuters News Service.

"New England Trades","Scott ---

I put this together to sort of summarize our activity to date on New England points.  As you can see, the volumes are moving up pretty steadily and we're at least getting a presence up there - with no assets, virtually no transport.  At the same time, we've taken pretty minimal risk.  Also of note, we are getting alot more calls for multiple month pricing on these points as well.

Please see attached spreadsheet....
