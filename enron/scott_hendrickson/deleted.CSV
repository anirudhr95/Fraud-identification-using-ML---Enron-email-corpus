BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
The vagaries of semiconductor supply and demand once again
drove stock trading -- this time to the delight of
chip-stock investors. Thanks to a positive profit spin from
National Semiconductor, stocks of companies that make chips
and chip equipment soared.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1 percent, climbing 46 to
2,264. The Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500
closed fractionally higher.

But shares in the semiconductor sector jumped more than 6
percent after National Semi, despite reporting a quarterly
loss, projected better sales in the months ahead. The chip
maker pointed out that its clients' semiconductor
inventories have plummeted, suggesting they'll need to bump
up their orders sometime soon. National Semi shares surged
11 percent to 31.04, while sector heavyweight Intel climbed
4.5 percent and Applied Micro Devices rose 6.7 percent.

Chip makers' gains spread cheer to other corners of the
technology arena. Computer networkers jumped 5 percent,
propelled by a 5.1-percent gain in Cisco shares, and makers
of electronic instruments rose 3.3 percent.

About half of S&P industry groups advanced. Among the
biggest decliners were tobacco stocks, defense contractors
and photo-imaging companies. Shares of the most widely held
companies generally rose, except for modest declines in
International Business Machines, AOL TimeWarner, and
Citigroup. Overall trading volume was light.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Monday, June 4.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Stocks shuffled aimlessly Monday in quiet trading,
eventually closing slightly higher across the board.
Neither a healthy inflation outlook from the Federal
Reserve chairman nor a bleak semiconductor sales report
seemed to excite investors.

Blue chips sported the biggest gains as the Dow Jones
industrial average rose a whopping 0.6 percent, gaining 71
points to 11,062. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 7 to 2,156
and the Standard & Poor's 500 climbed 6 to 1,267.

Overnight, Fed chief Alan Greenspan told a Singapore
monetary-policy conference that U.S. inflation is under
control, at least as far as consumers are concerned.
Normally, that would be something to shout about. But
Greenspan blunted any optimistic response by pointing out
the reason inflation remains at bay: In order to fend off
competition and keep you and me as customers, companies are
accepting slimmer profit margins instead of raising prices.

Greenspan's comments inspired an early pop that quickly
fizzled.

The other big piece of before-the-bell news -- the
Semiconductor Industry Association's April sales report --
exerted a more lasting influence, but only on chip stocks.
The SIA said chip sales slumped 4.7 percent in April from
March. In response, producers of both chips and chip-making
equipment lost ground. Applied Micro Devices fell more than
6 percent and Applied Materials lost about 2.5 percent.
Industry giant Intel was little changed, while shares of
Cypress Semiconductor actually rose, despite the company's
profit warning.

Oil-related shares rose as crude prices bubbled higher,
this time in response to more threats of supply disruption
from Iraq. The S&P oil-drilling group climbed 2.3 percent,
while the more diversified oil-and-gas group rose 1.5
percent. Triton Energy, meanwhile, surged more than 15
percent after the company announced a huge oilfield
discovery off the African coast.

More broadly, about two-thirds of S&P industry groups
tallied gains, although nothing moved particularly fast or
far.

SCOUTING REPORT: TUESDAY
Late spring can feel an awful lot like summer. A light
economic calendar and slow trickle of earnings reports
could spell -- say it with me -- quiet trading. Of course,
making that prediction leaves one vulnerable to all sorts
of surprises. So tomorrow looks slow, but that could change
with the morning headlines.


ECONOMIC CALENDAR:
*April factory orders, forecast: -2.7 percent
*Revised Q1 productivity, forecast: -0.7 percent


STOCKS
* AOL Still Spells Growth *
Most analysts like AOL Time Warner's prospects for growing
its bottomline.
http://www.cnbc.com/010604mcreynolds-stocks.html?ReferrerID=MM

* Pick of the Week: Alliant *
Alliant Techsystems may be the best defense industry stock
to buy now, analysts say.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

[IMAGE]	[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]   In the News  June 7, 2001  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]Rolling blackouts, silver linings  [IMAGE]3Com warns; discontinues cable, DSL  [IMAGE]Intel stands by its original target  [IMAGE]Microsoft, Red Hat set open-source debate  [IMAGE]Optics gear on parade at SuperComm  [IMAGE]HP storage goals switch channels   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Special reports [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]    Instant replay Microsoft's instant messaging tactics are reminiscent of those the company employed in the browser wars. Read Full Story   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Rolling blackouts, silver linings  Although California's energy crisis panics most technology companies in Silicon Valley, some start-ups aren't afraid of the dark. Executives in the energy niche say the Golden State's rolling blackouts have made venture capitalists take notice of their projects and prospects. Once considered a relatively dull subset of the broader technology sector filled with Old Economy utility behemoths, the energy industry has expanded to include start-ups such as business-to-business e-commerce ventures that build online exchanges for energy providers.  June 7, 2001, 12:40 p.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  3Com warns; discontinues cable, DSL  The network equipment maker, which has now announced an earnings warning for three straight quarters, said it now expects to earn $450 million to $475 million for the fourth quarter ended June 1. Company executives previously expected earnings of $550 to $600 million, a 3Com representative said.  June 7, 2001, 1:35 p.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Intel stands by its original target  Intel stuck to its original sales range for the second quarter. After market close Thursday and before its midquarter earnings report, the maker of PC processors, chipsets and communications chips said revenue, gross margin and expenses for the second quarter would be slightly below the midpoint of the range predicted by the company in April.  June 7, 2001, 1:35 p.m. PT |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Microsoft, Red Hat set open-source debate  After claiming last month that the open-source model is flawed and ""responsible for releasing unhealthy code,"" Microsoft Senior Vice President Craig Mundie is set to debate the issue at an open-source conference in July. Mundie is expected to explain why Microsoft's vision of ""shared source"" software, where the software giant makes the source code of some of its products available to customers and partners while still maintaining the intellectual property rights, is better than open source.  June 7, 2001, 1:25 p.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Optics gear on parade at SuperComm  Fiber-optic hardware makers strutted their stuff at SuperComm 2001, as the communications industry gathered in Atlanta to view the latest offerings from the equipment sector. Companies such as Nortel Networks, Lucent Technologies, Corning and smaller manufacturers introduced a variety of new optical gear at the annual communications industry conference, despite sluggish sales in the past year. Equipment for metropolitan networks and systems capable of 40 gigabit-per-second speeds were particularly prominent.  June 7, 2001, 11:55 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  HP storage goals switch channels  Hewlett-Packard will expand its storage products in a new direction in coming months, a move that will mean new competition against a host of networking competitors. HP currently sells storage systems, the devices that actually hold information. But by the end of this year or early next year, HP will introduce a high-end network switch for shuttling data between storage devices, Nora Denzel, vice president of HP's Network Storage Solutions Organization, said in an interview at HP's semiannual analyst day Wednesday.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, June 6.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
A day after upbeat profit forecasts lifted stocks, a couple
of earnings warnings knocked them back down. J.P. Morgan
Chase and Hewlett-Packard -- two members of the Dow Jones
industrials -- both projected difficult business conditions
in the quarters ahead.

J.P Morgan Chase fell 3.4 percent after warning of lower
trading revenue, and H-P shares dipped 4.5 percent after
the company said the global technology slowdown could
persist for some time. Other financial and computer stocks
fell in sympathy.

Their losses helped drag the Dow down 106, or 0.9 percent,
to 11,070. More broadly, the Nasdaq Composite fell 16 to
2,218 and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 14 to 1,270.

Energy stocks lost ground thanks to news that U.S.
inventories of crude oil and gasoline rose sharply in the
latest week. The weekly update from the American Petroleum
Institute showed a 3.4-million-barrel increase in crude
stocks and led prices of both gas and oil lower.

Exxon-Mobil shares fell 2.3 percent to 89.40, accounting
for about 13 Dow index points. Oil drillers, natural-gas
producers and refiners all saw their share prices decline.

Fewer than a third of S&P industry groups posted gains
Wednesday, and those that rose generally advanced 2 percent
or less. Health care companies, defense stocks,
consumer-products makers and electronics retailers did best.

     Special Offer from Traditional Home Magazine  		
 Trust yourself! Make  your home all you want it to be with gracious style for the perfect, easy  way you want to live. There's never been a better time to subscribe .     		
 Dear  scott,  Welcome  to the Better Homes and Garden Test Kitchen. All of the Better Homes and  Gardens recipes have been tested in the magazine's famed Test Kitchen.        [IMAGE]Cucumber  Buns  Cucumbers from the garden give these fluffy yeast rolls  a fresh vegetable flavor.         For a printable version  of this recipe, click  here.       For more recipes,  click here.    New this week:  Berries  of Summer: Learn about one of summer's best kept secrets: the berry.    		
[IMAGE]     3-1/4 to  3-3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 package active dry yeast   2 tablespoons  snipped fresh chives or 1 tablespoon dried chives   1 medium  cucumber, peeled and cut up (1-1/2 cups)   1 teaspoon  snipped fresh dill or 1/2 teaspoon dried dillweed               1/2 cup dairy  sour cream   1/4 cup water    1 tablespoon  sugar   1 teaspoon  salt     		
		
     1. In a large mixing bowl combine 1-1/4 cups of the flour, yeast,  chives, and dill. In a food processor bowl, process cucumber until smooth  (should have 3/4 cup). In a saucepan heat and stir cucumber puree, sour  cream, water, sugar, and salt until warm (120 degree F. to 130 degree  F.). (Mixture will look curdled.) Add to flour mixture. Beat with an electric  mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl. Beat on high  speed for 3 minutes more. Using a spoon, stir in as much of the remaining  flour as you can.      2.   Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining  flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to  8 minutes). Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn once  to grease surface. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double (about  45 minutes).  3.   Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover; let  rest 10 minutes. Divide into 12 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball;  arrange in a greased 13x9x2-inch baking pan, allowing space between each  ball. Cover; let rise in a warm place until nearly double (about 30 minutes).  Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until light brown.  Serve warm or cool. Makes 12 rolls.  Make-Ahead Tip:  Cool buns completely. Wrap in foil and place in airtight freezer container  or plastic freezer bag; seal, label and freeze up to 1 month. Thaw and  serve at room temperature or reheat foil-wrapped frozen buns in 300 degree  F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until warm.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Tuesday, June 5.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Optimistic profit reports powered technology shares
Tuesday, carrying a broad swath of the stock market higher.
Upbeat news from chip maker Xilinx, software company
Comverse Technology and even telecom-equipment pariah
Lucent inspired the kind of Nasdaq euphoria rarely seen in
recent months.

Near day's end, the Nasdaq Composite stood 3.6 percent
higher, up 78 to 2,233. Blue chips rose less markedly but
still put on a good show. The Dow Jones industrial average
climbed 114 to 11,176, largely on the strength of its
technology components (Microsoft and IBM both jumped more
than 2.5 percent). More broadly, the Standard & Poor's 500
rose 16 to 1,284.

Chip stocks and computer networkers stole the show.

Xilinx climbed 9.7 percent after the company affirmed its
earlier profit forecasts and said order cancellations were
slowing. Other makers of chips and related equipment also
rose strongly. Intel climbed 4.3 percent, Advanced Micro
Devices rose 4.7 percent and KLA Tencor advanced 7.2
percent. Many of these stocks were rebounding from big
declines Monday sparked by a worrisome April chip-sales
report.

Lucent shares surged 6 percent to 8.48 after the company
forecast improving quarterly sales figures. More than 20
million shares of Lucent changed hands on the New York
Stock Exchange, making it the day's most active NYSE-listed
stock. Other makers of telecom components and network
equipment fared similarly. Cisco rose 9.2 percent,
Cabletron Systems climbed 8.1 percent and Juniper Networks
rose 4.8 percent.

Among the most widely held names, only a handul of stocks
lost ground. Pfizer, Walt Disney and CNBC parent General
Electric tallied modest declines, while most other widely
recognized companies enjoyed gains.

More broadly, utilities, construction companies,
photo-imaging stocks and tobacco were among a small group
of S&P sectors posting losses on the day.

			Digital Dispatch    [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  				
[IMAGE]	[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]   June 7, 2001   [IMAGE]  --Steve Fox, editor in chief, CNET.com     Dear readers, I can't resist a good fight: Napster vs. the RIAA, Intel vs. AMD, Palm vs. Pocket PC. But in my opinion, nothing beats the PC vs. Mac rivalry. It's an ongoing conflict that has generated more bad blood, accusatory e-mails (just ask any tech editor), and overall charges of press bias than any other high-tech confrontation imaginable. The responsible folks on the CNET Software team considered playing peacemaker to the warring tribes, possibly building consensus and even trying to heal old wounds. But that wouldn't be much fun, would it? So instead, we've decided to add fuel to the fire with the third installment of our OS death match, this time pitting Mac OS X against Windows 2000 . This highly unscientific battle royale compares the two heavyweight contenders from each camp to see who gets to wear the crown. Tell us what you think at software-mailbag@cnet.com . We've braced ourselves for the onslaught.       This Week's Top 10   Top 10 celebrity viruses       [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Software [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Net payment nightmares  It may be convenient to pay for goods digitally, but that path is fraught with danger. Your money may get lost in the ether, you might get locked out of your account, or you may end up paying for goods you never receive. Read on for five frightening tales of transaction terrors, plus tips on how to avoid or fix them. In Software     Electronics [IMAGE] Get the PDA that's right for you  There are as many ways to use handhelds as there are hands to be held. But to make things a little easier, we've narrowed down the field a bit to students, executives, gamers, musicians, and a few other categories. If you're looking for some advice on which PDA is just right for you, click the link above. In Electronics   Wireless [IMAGE] Ask the cell phone diva  We were so impressed by the response to our Wireless Insider ""What people are asking the cell phone diva"" story that we decided to make it a regular feature on CNET Wireless. Senior Editor Joni Blecher will do her best to track down the answers to all your questions about cell phones, service providers, and accessories. So keep 'em coming! In Wireless    Software [IMAGE] OS death match: OS X vs. Windows 2000  OS X versus Windows 2000, eh? Sure, why not? Both of these operating systems are workstation ready, server friendly, and easy enough for even the smallest home office. So how does plain-Jane Windows 2000 match up with OS X's bells and whistles? We tossed these two operating systems into the arena in a heavyweight matchup, and only we can pick a winner. In Software    Hardware [IMAGE] For richer or for poorer: WinBook X1, J1  How different can two 1GHz notebooks from the same company be? Quite a bit, actually. We pit the sleek WinBook X1 against the bargain WinBook J1 to see which is the better deal. In Hardware    Web Building [IMAGE] Tricks of the trade  As dot-coms fold and thousands of Web workers get pink-slipped, adult Web sites remain a reliable and profitable online venture. Learn how the technologies that are commonly used to put adult content on the Web can be used on any site to successful ends. In Web Building          celebrity viruses [IMAGE] Top Ten  [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] The Chernobyl virus is back, this time lurking  in messages that promise naked pictures of actress/singer Jennifer Lopez. The e-mail tempts credulous users with the subject line ""Where are you,"" and an attachment (jenniferlopez_naked.jpg.vbs) that, when opened, can delete files and make hash of your hard drive. Fortunately, few people have fallen for the Lopez virus. But in light of this latest attack, coupled with February's Anna Kournikova worm , we here at CNET are worried about future celebrity-based viruses. Here are 10 nasties we hope never make it to your in-box:    10 The Madonna virus This unstoppable pathogen defies antivirus programs by constantly reinventing itself. 9 The Jim Jeffords virus Partitions your hard drive so that the two sides don't want to work together. 8 The Michael Jackson virus Launch this bad boy and your entire screen slowly fades to white. 7 The Anne Heche virus Changes all your system settings...then switches them back to the original defaults. 6 The Ozzy Osborne virus Bites the heads off BAT files. 5 The Calista Flockhart virus Claims to eat up your RAM, but we've never noticed any significant impact. 4 The Dan Quayle virus When you run spell-check, this macro virus randomly adds the letter e to the ends of words. 3 The Marcel Marceau virus Deletes all your MP3 and WAV files. 2 The Oprah Winfrey virus Resets your Amazon.com cookies so that you have nothing but Oprah's Book Club titles on your wish list. 1 The Claus Von Bulow virus Rumors that it puts your PC into permanent sleep mode are patently false.

1. LOOKING FORWARD
Our Take: Waiting Period

Economic and Market Outlook:

Two months of upswing and hesitation has crept back into the markets.  Analysts are busy downgrading sectors and stocks, stating that prices have risen too much - unsupported by the fundamentals. It is true that  industry problems are too deep rooted to be miraculously solved overnight.  The markets' rise is more likely due to a change in investor sentiment - an attitude of ""enough is enough"" - rather than an elimination of the problems.

However, it is also true that recovery is on its way. Inventories are  improving and  rate cuts are  spurring consumer spending. The production lines will start rolling again. The only hitch is a lengthy wait for consumer demand to translate into capital spending and a resolution of  overcapacity. The Fed is doing its best: patience is the name of the game. Till then, volatility in the market is inevitable.

Economic data expected next week includes factory orders, construction spending, NAPM services index, wholesale inventories and consumer credit.

Economic Calendar: http://www.123jump.com/econ_cal_live.htm

Earnings Outlook:

There is still a month before earnings season, but warnings season has begun. If the latest warnings are any sample of what has yet to come, investors have a right to be wary.

Name                           Date     Est EPS  Whispers
Comverse Technology (CMVT)     6/4/01    0.42     0.43
Riverstone Networks (RSTN)     6/4/01   -0.05      -
Carrekar Corporation (CANI)    6/5/01    0.12     0.12
Comtech Telecom. (CMTL)        6/5/01    0.17     0.17
Omnivision Technologies (OVTI) 6/6/01    0.00     0.00
BE Aerospace (BEAV)            6/6/01    0.24     0.28
National Semiconductor (NSM)   6/7/01   -0.03    -0.03

http://www.123jump.com/p5t.htm

IPO Outlook:

It is heartening to finally see some activity in the IPO market.  Two months of rally have raised the spirits of aspiring firms, encouraging them to step up to the debut plate.

2. LAST WEEK

Economic and Market Update:

Following a lackluster Friday, even the Memorial Day holiday weekend  couldn't revitalize the bulls. Stocks headed steadily downward until Tuesday evening, troubled by earnings warnings, analyst downgrades and acquisition news. Tech stocks were worst hit. Wednesday was, however, a different story - investors flocked back to the stock market to buy anything from tech to Old Economy.

Networking, semiconductor, fiber-optic, software and Internet stocks were hurt most in the tech sector. Other sectors that took a beating were utilities, biotech, retail and finance. Sectors that showed strength for the first half of the week included drug, medical, insurance, chemical and paper stocks.

On the economic front, consumer confidence rose to 115.5 in May from a revised 109.9 in April. Aggressive rate cuts by the Fed and renewed strength in the stock markets have boosted the spirits of consumers. This infused hope that consumer spending may rebound.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Friday, June 1.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Confused investors staged a two-act play Friday.

First, they scrambled to react to confusing reports on
labor conditions and manufacturing. U.S. companies cut
fewer jobs last month than anticipated while activity at
factories slumped further. The manufacturing figures are
roughly in line with other recent factory readings, but the
jobs release is a head-scratcher -- and that's why major
indexes bounced up and down in a tight range much of
Friday.

But sometime after lunch, investors began to bid up key
stocks and the major indexes followed.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 78 points at
10,990. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 39 to close out
the week at 2149. The S&P 500 ended up 5 at 1261.

Optimism has resurfaced that perhaps the worst is over for
technology stocks. Intel, Microsoft and Oracle advanced.
Novellus and Flextronics affirmed that their earnings would
fulfill current expectations, and shares of both companies
jumped more than 5 percent. (Sometimes ""poor visibility""
turns out okay. Just keep your guard up -- second-quarter
confessionals are starting to roll in.)

Perhaps short-term money should head for the beach and
leave stock picking to the folks looking ahead six to 12
months, or longer. Surely there are bargains ready to pop,
but finding them has never been tougher.

SCOUTING REPORT: MONDAY

Next week's calendar is devoid of economic reports that
will matter five minutes after they hit the tape.
Amazon.com talks to analysts on Tuesday -- keep an eye on
that. And look for a little craziness in small-caps in
coming days. The Russell 2000 index gets its annual reset
on July 1, based on market caps as of May 31. Could be a
little scramble to front-run the indexed fund managers who
have to buy the new kids on the block.

Read Full Story   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   High rollers place bets online  A skirmish in the war over online gambling comes to a head Monday, the deadline for Nevada legislators to approve a long-shot measure that could lead to legalizing the practice in the state. The bill is not expected to pass, but it has garnered new attention as some big-name casinos have switched their position regarding the Net, for the first time seeking to legalize online wagering.

An unknown attacker last week hit the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center, an important agency for passing information on the latest vulnerabilities in computer systems among security experts.

The Czech company Blokman Trading has released a test, or alpha, version of the Linux 2.4 kernel for the original PlayStation console--now dubbed PSone. Sony has strictly controlled its release of PlayStation 2 Linux, building 1,000 of the kits that are set to go on sale this summer and will work only on the Japanese version of the console.

The company has set aside 10 million shares to use for investing in or acquiring other companies, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. eBay paid $151,350 to register the shares, which are worth more than $600 million at the company's current stock price.

A survey conducted by Kinetic Strategies found there are 9.3 million residential customers of broadband Internet services in North America, which includes 8.2 percent household penetration.

 Dear  scott,  Welcome  to the Better Homes and Garden Test Kitchen. All of the Better Homes and  Gardens recipes have been tested in the magazine's famed Test Kitchen.        [IMAGE]Pork  Medallions with Summer Salsa  Jalapeno peppers add a bit of hotness to the refrshing  fruit-and-vegetable salsa.         For a printable version  of this recipe, click  here.       For more recipes,  click here.    New this week:  Berries  of Summer: Learn about one of summer's best kept secrets: the berry.    		
[IMAGE]     8 boneless  pork loin chops, cut 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inches thick (America's Cut)    1/4 cup lime  juice   1/4 cup Worcestershire  sauce   1/4 cup coarse-grain  brown mustard or Dijon-style mustard   3 tablespoons  vinegar              2 tablespoons  water   1-1/2 teaspoons  ground cumin   1/4 teaspoon  salt   1/8 teaspoon  pepper   1 recipe  Summer Salsa (see below)    		
		
     1. Place the pork loin chops in a clean, heavy plastic bag. Set  the bag in a large bowl. Combine the lime juice, Worcestershire sauce,  mustard, vinegar, water, cumin, salt, and pepper. Pour over the pork in  bag; seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or  up to 24 hours, turning occasionally.     2.   Remove the pork from the bag, reserving marinade. Grill* pork on an uncovered  grill directly over medium coals for 20 to 30 minutes or until thermometer  registers 160 degrees F., juices run clear, and meat is slightly pink  in center; halfway through cooking turn and brush with marinade. Serve  with Summer Salsa. Makes 8 servings.   *To broil: Place pork  on unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 22  to 24 minutes or until thermometer registers 160 degrees F. and juices  run clear, turning once halfway through cooking and brushing with marinade.    Summer  Salsa: In  a medium mixing bowl combine 1-1/2 cups chopped fresh apricots or peeled  peaches; 3/4 cup chopped red or green sweet pepper; 3/4 cup chopped, seeded  cucumber; 1/4 cup sliced green onion; 1 to 2 jalapeno peppers**, seeded  and finely chopped; 2 tablespoons honey; 2 tablespoons lime juice; and  1 tablespoon snipped fresh cilantro or parsley. Cover; chill for up to  4 hours, stirring once or twice. Serve with a slotted spoon. Makes about  2-1/2 cups salsa.   **Note:  Because hot chile peppers contain volatile oils that can burn your eyes,  lips, and skin, avoid direct contact with them as much as possible. When  working with chili peppers, cover your hands with plastic bags (or wear  plastic or rubber gloves). Be sure to wash your hands well with soap and  water before touching your eyes or face.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Thursday, May 31.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Bargain hunters made a comeback try today, but all three
major indexes are still down four days out of the past six.
Recall that only a week ago, we toasted the Nasdaq
Composite's sixth straight higher close. That was 200
points ago.

Investors initially bid stocks sharply higher Thursday,
snapping up shares beaten down in Wednesday's selloff. But
their stamina failed before a serious attempt at last
week's summit could be mounted.

Only the Nasdaq Composite managed a significant move. It
climbed 26 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,111. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 39 to 10,912 and the Standard &
Poor's 500 edged up 8 points to 1,256 -- fractional
advances for both.

One hitch might have been this morning's report on weekly
unemployment claims. The government says initial jobless
filings rose for a third straight week, while a measure of
ongoing claims hit a seven-and-a-half-year high. Stocks
usually brush off these erratic weekly labor figures. But
it's hard to ignore bad news three weeks straight.

Adding to economic concerns, a survey of Chicago-region
purchasing managers showed factory activity at
recession-esque levels in May. That's another hint recovery
could be further off than any of us would like to think.

But check your portfolio before you get start feeling too
negative. About two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks rose today,
led by those of cellular-phone companies,
photographic-products firms and health care providers.

Among the biggest losers were publishers, insurance
brokers, restaurants and precious-metals miners.

Scott Gerlach
Managing Editor, CNBC.com

MAJOR INDEXES AND VOLUMES
* Dow Jones Industrials: 10,911.94, up 39.30 or 0.36%

* Dow Jones Utilities: 393.22, up 4.75 or 1.22%

SCOUTING REPORT: FRIDAY
Brace yourself for some bad news. Those weekly jobless
claims figures that have been sliding of late are about to
get backed up by another weak monthly employment report.
Forecasters think the economy lost about 90,000 jobs in
May, and they expect the unemployment rate to tick up to
4.6 percent. These numbers probably are priced into the
market already, so don't expect the bottom to fall out --
unless the forecasts prove optimistic.

ECONOMIC CALENDAR
*Nonfarm payrolls for May, forecast: -90,000.
*Unemployment rate for May, forecast: 4.6 percent.
*Average hourly wage for May, forecast: +0.3 percent.
*NAPM manufacturing index for May, forecast: 43.7.

STOCKS
* Technical Analysis Mailbag *
Given recent bearish action, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 could
see more downside.

The acquisition will allow BeCG to thread Myplay's music-storage service throughout its other online retail brands, such as CDNow and its BMG Music Service record club.

The first is a joint project among Big Blue and Japanese server leaders NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi to improve Linux for big businesses. The second project, separate but with similar goals, is a new Japanese branch of the Open-Source Development Lab (OSDL), where programmers can test their software on expensive high-end systems.

The e-mail is circulating in the United Kingdom, advising people to delete a harmless Microsoft Windows utility called sulfnbk.exe from their hard disks. Antivirus experts were quick to point out that the e-mail does not contain a worm and is being passed around by well-meaning people alarmed at its contents.

Read Full Story   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Blackout betrays Web's weak spot  For much of the past week, two large stretches of the Internet turned invisible to each other. Unlike the electrical outages plaguing California, which no one wants, this intentional blackout suited the purposes of one side in the collapse of talks between two major Internet service providers, Cable & Wireless and the financially strapped PSINet. A critical link between the two networks was cut, blocking some companies from seeing their own Web sites, and stalling e-mail between thousands of sources.  June 6, 2001, 10:30 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Free-speech lawsuit targets record industry  The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of a group of scientists, asking that they be allowed to publish research on anti-copying technology despite protests from the entertainment industry. The paper, which discusses weaknesses in some watermarking technology that record companies were considering as protection for their music, was quashed in April after the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) and the Recording Industry Association of America discouraged Princeton professor Edward Felten from presenting his findings, saying he risked breaking copyright laws.  June 6, 2001, 12:25 p.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Clowning around at Computex  The war of words between Via Technologies and rival Intel has been fast and furious as usual, but the most heated comments at Computex are not about which deals were cut, but rather which balloons. Both chipmakers wanted to show the support that exists for their processors and chipsets by having companies that use their products display balloons with the chipmakers' respective logos at this week's trade show here.  June 6, 2001, 11:45 a.m. PT |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  U.S. PC shipments seen declining  The next couple of years will be lean ones in the PC industry, research firm IDC predicted on Wednesday. IDC revised its 2001 forecast for overall PC shipments, lowering projections for the United States and worldwide. For the first time, U.S. shipments are expected to decline from the preceding year.  June 6, 2001, 11:55 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Future Power settles iMac suit  Future Power on Tuesday said it has settled a lawsuit with Apple Computer, which claimed the company sold a look-alike version of its popular, fruit-colored iMac computers. Apple, which filed the federal lawsuit against Future Power in July 1999, had contested the company's right to sell an all-in-one system built around a 15-inch monitor available in translucent colors similar to the iMac. The case had been scheduled for trial in the U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif., the company said.

The action is another in a series of measures that the Murray Hill, N.J.-based company is taking to get itself shipshape again. Lucent is already in the middle of a restructuring plan, in which 2,000 employees have been let go thus far, and that includes layoffs of 10,000 by July. The 10,000 early retirees are not part of the layoff tally.

Read Full Story   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Broadcom gets sweet on Bluetooth  Chipmaker Broadcom announced Monday a new chip for wireless devices that conforms to the Bluetooth standard, which could reduce costs for device makers and help jumpstart the Bluetooth wireless networking market. The BCM2033 is a single chip that runs on Bluetooth technology, which allows wireless devices such as handheld computers, mobile phones and even laptops to communicate with each other within a distance of about 30 feet.  June 4, 2001, 11:30 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Microsoft's new IM takes aim at AOL  Microsoft this week will introduce a test version of Windows XP that significantly boosts the abilities of its instant-messaging software to provide text, chat, video, audio and telephony services. As earlier reported, the software, dubbed Windows Messenger, is Microsoft's effort to bundle other communications technologies with Internet instant messaging and to gain an advantage over rival AOL Time Warner.  June 4, 2001, 10:15 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Wall Street preps for Intel outlook  Intel will host its first midquarter update with analysts Thursday, and Wall Street analysts aren't expecting much. The chipmaker will brief analysts on its second-quarter outlook after the market closes Thursday. While the meeting is not expected to be revelatory, as Goldman Sachs analyst Terry Ragsdale put it, ""We don't see how the news can be good.""  June 4, 2001, 11:10 a.m. PT |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Java: Sun's tool vs. Microsoft  The JavaOne conference in San Francisco this week will highlight old uses for new Java, while the wireless industry gets a taste for the programming language.  June 4, 2001, 4:00 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Toshiba's new angle on chip design  The company on Monday announced X Architecture, a new design method that promises to increase the performance and reduce the size and power consumption of system-on-a-chip processors. The X architecture changes the way a chip's interconnects--metal wires that connect transistors and carry signals--are routed. X architecture allows the interconnects to be routed diagonally across the chip in any of eight directions, instead of following the traditional right-angle-grid routing method used in all but a few of today's chips.  June 4, 2001, 10:15 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Yahoo teams with Consumer Reports  Yahoo on Monday announced a subscription service that will sell product ratings and buying guides from Consumer Reports magazine on Yahoo's shopping sites in a continuing effort to diversify its revenue sources beyond advertising. The Internet media giant said it will also integrate free buying guides from Consumer Reports. The free guides on Yahoo will contain only general summaries of product categories, buying advice and information. Consumers can opt for pay-per-view product reports for $2.95 each.

Read Full Story   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Office XP: Open for business  Industry analysts say Office XP is financially the most important product Microsoft will ship this fiscal year. But the software giant will have its work cut out for it, as there's little in the way of incentives to get businesses to upgrade.  May 31, 2001, 9:00 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  When wireless turns sluggish  Last weekend, San Jose, Calif., resident Joe Curcio began tracking how often his Sprint wireless Internet connection actually worked. The results were distressing: The service was sporadically down for a total of 8 hours each day. Curcio is one of a growing, increasingly vocal group of Sprint customers around the country complaining that the company's high-speed wireless Internet connections aren't working as promised and that Sprint hasn't followed through on repeated promises to fix problems.

In a notice posted on its Web site, the Apache Software Foundation said its public server--which handles mailing lists and stores source code for all foundation projects--was illegally accessed earlier this month. The intrusion was quickly discovered and the server was taken offline.

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Illinois against Digital Wireless Technologies seeks damages of $1 million, plus $25,000 for every day since Jan. 1 that the e-mails have been sent, or $10 per e-mail.

PeopleSoft is set to unveil Monday additional features and applications that will round out PeopleSoft 8 CRM, its newly introduced collection of customer-relationship management software. CRM software helps a company manage its front-office operations--that is, sales, marketing and customer service.

Now, the Microsoft chairman is spinning his own urban myth for the millennium generation: Clippy's demise. Clippy, the cute but much maligned animated paper clip introduced with Office 97, was given his walking papers by Microsoft recently as part of a $30 million marketing campaign promoting Office XP.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, May 30.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Technology stocks, including Sun Microsystems, led most
other stocks on a mass march to the downside on Wednesday.
Profit warnings, coupled with thin trading and a lack of
buyers, caused most industry groups and shares to decline.

Investors are beginning to question the widely held view
that economic growth and corporate profits are poised to
rebound by the second half of this year, analysts say.

The Nasdaq Composite Index ended down 91 points, or 4.2
percent, to 2085. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 20
points, or 1.6 percent, to 1248. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 167, or 1.5 percent, to 10,872.

The focal point of the trading day was Sun.

Sun closed down 13.8 percent at 16.10. The maker of
computer servers warned that its earnings in its fourth
quarter will be less than previously expected. It said
customers are buying less than anticipated, citing Europe
as particularly weak. The news hurt other tech companies.
Cisco, Oracle, IBM, and others also fell.

The most troubling aspect of the sell off was it touched
almost every corner of the market. Energy was the only
major industry group that managed to post a gain, which was
minimal.

Some analysts say investors should take the long-term view
when investing this summer.

SCOUTING REPORT: THURSDAY
The long wait for marguee economic data continues Thursday.
With the May jobs report looming on Friday, the help-wanted
index and Chicago purchasing managers' index should have
little impact. Earnings are nearly done but early warnings
are possible from here on out. In thin trading, funny
things can happen.

MEMORIES
""My father coached me in Little League baseball, he was a member of the
booster club. He was always very involved, and he would come to all the
games in high school and college, no matter where we were playing. He was my
toughest critic, but also my biggest supporter. My fondest memory was during
my sophomore year in college. I went down and worked out at the Phillies
complex in Florida before the Mount Union baseball team went down there for
our spring trip. My father went down and spent the whole week with me. He
loved baseball and to enjoy that atmosphere with him was very meaningful.""
-- Texans Coach Dom Capers on his relationship with his father

""My dad and I are very different people, and about the only thing we have in
common is our love of sports. He calls me every week, and we talk for about
an hour. Probably 80 percent to 90 percent of what we talk about is
football. Anybody who overhears our conversations must think we're nuts. I'm
looking forward to the Texans playing next year, so my dad and I can start
going to a couple of Texans games a year at Reliant.""

behavior that also could lead to AIDS.

> CDC WANTS MORE COMPANIES MAKING FLU VACCINE


America will continue to risk flu vaccine shortages as long as only a handful
of companies produce the vaccine, health officials said Thursday.

> REVIEW: 'MOULIN ROUGE' DAZZLING, ELECTRIFYING


""Moulin Rouge"" is, quite simply, a spectacular reinvention of the movie
musical. It's a movie full of color, and song, and a lot of panache. All that
style doesn't always work -- and at times things get too frantic and the
editing becomes too fragmented -- but as a whole this ambitious project flies
off the screen.

> REVIEW: 'WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?' YES, IT IS


The title of Martin Lawrence's new picture, ""What's the Worst That Could
Happen?"", is meant as a rhetorical question. But it only takes about 10 minutes

crummy movie.

> 'NYPD' BLUE, AGAIN: RICK SCHRODER LEAVING SHOW


Rick Schroder has turned in his badge. According to Daily Variety, the actor
has announced that he will leave the ABC drama ""NYPD Blue"" after spending two
and a half seasons playing the emotionally troubled Detective Danny Sorenson.

> 'SEX AND THE CITY,' AND TURNING THE BIG 3-5


Many women say ""Sex and the City"" strikes a chord they don't find on network
TV. The HBO show is the epitome of female fantasy -- at least, of the sitcom
variety. Cast members chatted with CNN at the show's fourth-season premiere
party.

June is the time to celebrate Dads and Grads! We want to remind you that gifts from eVineyard are the perfect choice for both of them.   Of course there's our tasteful selection of more than 5,000 premium wines. Here are just two of our favorites:

Canoe Ridge 1998 Merlot, Columbia Valley, Washington
This Merlot has soft plum and chocolate flavors, a smooth feel, and an excellent finish.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247d

Piper Sonoma NV Brut, California
We like this Brut for its crisp and bright character, berry-apple fruit and faint vanilla flavors.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247f

Maybe the Dads and Grads on your list are adventure-lovers. Open the world of wine exploration to them with our Wine Clubs. Choose from five distinctive clubs, each one a trip around the world without ever leaving home. Wine Odyssey is a fun and easy way to learn about wine by tasting a carefully selected variety of premium imported and domestic labels. Our TasteTour(tm) Wine Course(tm) is a comprehensive education in wine, guided by Chief Wine Officer, Ronn Wiegand. Ronn's expertise provides just the kind of ""inside information"" to make a wine lover into a connoisseur.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247h

Impress everyone with your thoughtfulness and include the Insta-pull Wine Operator, the world's fastest corkscrew, with your wine gift. A gentle pull of the handle lifts any cork from its bottle instantly. You'll find many clever gifts like this in eVineyard's collection of unique wine accessories.
http://www.evineyard.com/offer.asp?ID=evm247m

Still stumped? Let them choose for themselves! With eVineyard Gift Certificates, Dads and Grads can handpick their own gifts from everything we offer. Fun for them, easy for you. Let the celebration begin!

Cheers,
Michael

"June 22 - Gas Storage Conference - Register Today!","
Register before Friday June 1 and save $100 ! 
Is current storage fill giving us 
a false sense of security? 
It's May. And those AGA storage numbers might have us feeling pretty secure about the future. But a lot can happen in a few short months. Consider these likely scenarios:
This summer hot or hotter than last summer? Predictions abound. 
Record number of new gas fired electric generation units on-line this summer, increasing demand and the draw on storage. 
Severe drought affecting hydropower, the lowest output in 30 years. 
Natural gas supply availability virtually unchanged from last year's levels.                        Fact or fiction?

?

"Time to ditch your Walkman?","
			Digital Dispatch    [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  				
[IMAGE]	[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]   May 31, 2001   [IMAGE]  --Steve Fox, editor in chief, CNET Networks     Dear readers, If you have a handheld--or are thinking of buying one--maybe it's time to ditch your Walkman. Because listening to music on a handheld device (except a Palm) has finally become practical . What's the problem with Palm? For some inexplicable reason, the world's most popular handheld has no stereo headphone jack. But for most other devices, digital music is a natural. Virtually anything you might want to hear is available in MP3 format, and one broadcaster has even started a wireless digital-music delivery system (something like radio for handhelds). So grab your handheld and tune in. Sounds like a great formula for a harmonious year.       This Week's Top 10   Problems with the new McDonald's wand       [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Software [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Banking on the Net  Does anything call up images of bricks and mortar more than banks do? You'd think these traditional temples would be the last things to go high tech, but online banks are springing up left and right. Can they manage your money as well as your local teller can? CNET's secret shopper opened checking accounts at three online banks and compared the results. See which bank, if any, takes the golden coin. In Software     Electronics [IMAGE] Music on your handheld  Why buy a separate MP3 player when you already carry around a PDA with the processing power to handle digital audio? Learn the best ways to listen to music--and to make your own--on your Palm OS and Pocket PC handheld. In Electronics   Wireless [IMAGE] The ultimate guide to wireless e-mail devices  In the first two parts of our three-part series, we told you about options for Palm OS and Pocket PC devices. Now, in the third and final part, we round up the most popular two-way pagers for wireless e-mail. In Wireless    Software [IMAGE] Office XP superguide  At long last, Office XP hits the shelves this week. What's new and improved? Is your PC up to the challenge? Should you bother to upgrade? Here's everything you need to know about the world's most popular office suite. In Software    Hardware [IMAGE] Apple iBook: snow-white and skinny  The snow-white, slim, crisp-looking iBook takes obvious cues from its much-lauded big brother, the PowerBook G4. Has this little brother behaved? Check our first take. In Hardware    Web Building [IMAGE] Steal this Flash  You don't have to reinvent the wheel to have fun with Flash. We lead you through the ethics, challenges, and practical considerations of customizing open source ActionScript as you build your own version of Pac-Man by altering our media files. In Web Building          problems with the new McDonald's payment system [IMAGE] Top Ten  [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] McDonald's is experimenting with a high-tech payment system: a plastic wand that patrons wave in front of an electronic sensor to pay for burgers and such. Currently being tested in Boise, Idaho, the system  deducts the appropriate charge from a customer's debit or credit card. We don't know if McWands will ever catch on, but we urge Ronald and friends to think carefully before charging ahead. New technologies often yield unintended consequences; witness the following:    10 Open sesame bun Avid Harry Potter fans keep waving wands over their burgers, incanting Latinate phrases such as ""Super-sizius."" 9 Your money or your burger Get mugged by the Hamburglar and find that your credit card has been debited for 500 Happy Meals. 8 Is that a wand in your pocket... Rash of employee firings stemming from inappropriate wand jokes. 7 No, not the ""1812 Overture""! Prankster symphony conductors repeatedly crash the system. 6 Fuzzy magic Income tax equations thrown into disarray when federal government opts for construction of 200-ton wand to wave at national debt. 5 Drive-by wanding You're inadvertently charged for an order of Chicken McNuggets every time you pass a set of golden arches. 4 McDungeons and Dragons Role-playing gamers flock to the new system, only to cancel service when they discover the wands don't shoot fireballs. 3 Burned again Vigorous wand waving could overturn hot cups of coffee, resulting in immediate lawsuits. 2 Would you like spam with that? Wand transmits your demographic info to marketers, who bombard you with Clearasil and ThighMaster ads. 1 Over 10 billion slaughtered Militant vegetarian hackers reconfigure wand to automatically tabulate cow body count with every purchase.

"Outpost.com Lives!","

Dear Outpost.com customer,

As you may recall, I sent you an email about five weeks ago about the
tough times for dot-com companies and the tough times we were
experiencing here at Outpost.com. Amazingly, about 7,000 of you sent
us, well, they were pretty close to love letters, in response. Today
I am thrilled to be able to tell you that it now appears that, like
The Rolling Stones, we will indeed be here forever.

We have just announced that our friends at PC Connection have agreed
to acquire your favorite company, Outpost.com. The best part is that
we will remain Outpost.com and we will remain in our gorgeous
headquarters town of Kent, Connecticut. Thus, we will continue to do
business with you as we always have, with a deep commitment to you,
our customers, with our rather healthy sense of humor, and with the
enormous resources that will now be available to us through the PC
Connection family. And yes, the gerbil stays. We wouldn't have it any
other way.

The most immediate impact this will have on our business is that,
effective immediately, we have access to tens of millions of dollars
of inventory on a daily basis. This will help us speed your orders on
their way to you much sooner. The gerbil brought in some of his
buddies to work in the warehouse, so we now have many more hands
(paws?) available there as well.

Needless to say, we are awfully excited about this. PC Connection is
a company we have long admired, and to say that this is a good fit is
quite an understatement. So, the bottom line is that you are stuck
with us. We just won't go away and we plan on finding new and even
more clever ways to entertain you as you shop for a very long time to
come. As a matter of fact, we would really appreciate it if you could
help us name this silly gerbil as we are all getting tired of calling
him, ""Gerbil"". You can do this at:

Thanks again for all your support over the past six years. It has
been an honor serving you and getting to know you.

Founder, CEO & President
