BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

1. LOOKING FORWARD
Our Take: Bullish In Choppy Seas

Economic and Market Outlook:

Indicators point in both directions. The economy is still sluggish and the
industries are still in pain. Though recovery in the overall economy is
still blurred, recovery in some sectors seems on its way. The stock market
turned around after the April 4 debacle, but showed considerable
hesitation to move up last month. It took a step back for every step
forward. The Nasdaq slipped 0.27% for the month of May; the Dow showed
some strength, rising 1.6% in May.

Though the bullish trend is back and we can expect to see the markets
rising further in the next few months, the seas are choppy and frictional
factors will continue to pose hurdles in the upswing. A heartening fact is
that in April, $21 billion was invested in mutual funds as compared to a
net withdrawal of $20.6 billion in March. Further, the IPO market is
finally looking up and investors are treating the new issues fairly well.

2. LAST WEEK

Economic and Market Update:

The markets edged up still further this week, though the gains were not
impressive. More bad news flooded the market and investors were hesitant
to sell.  The oil and biotech sectors were strong; the chip sector
turned in a depressed performance before shifting gears on Thursday.
Guidance from Intel Corp. (INTC) and Applied Micro Devices (AMD) that
earnings will be in line with previous expectations infused the markets
with enthusiasm.
Intel guidance: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11865

On the economic front, initial jobless claims for the week rose to
432,000, the highest since 1992 and productivity declined 1.2% for the
first quarter, more than the expected 0.8% decline. This was the first
fall in total worker output per hour since 1993. Unit labor costs, an
important gauge of inflation, rose 6.3%.

Fed chief Alan Greenspan has repeatedly stressed the importance of
productivity in the U.S. economy to contain inflation and spur growth,
and the economic data this week dimmed the optimism. However, in a speech
in Singapore, Greenspan reiterated that inflation was not an issue and
that the rise in crude oil prices was temporary.
Jobless Claims: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11859
Productivity: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11799

Spirits were dampened further when Federal Reserve Governor Meyer stated
that he expects the economy to be sluggish into the second half of the
year. His view echoed the statement by Fed Bank of Richmond President
Alfred Broaddus, that the economy may have not yet have hit the bottom
and more rate cuts may be necessary to prevent a recession.

News at the industry level also did not look good. IDC reported that it
expects U.S. PC shipments to decline 6.3% in 2001, the first annual
decline ever. The Semiconductor Industry Association said that chip sales
could fall 14% this year. Further, they felt that PC and chip sales are
expected to be anemic even in 2002.

I need your assistance

Sitara 824147  - needs to be changed to Reliant Energy Services Inc. as the counterparty from Altrade.

"How's the weather there?","We are still getting to enjoy sunshine, but there's a very cool wind.
Yesterday was the anniversary of when we met...6 years ago!  Seems longer.
We dined at A?mann's, of course..our favorite place.

London was great!  I took my Goretex jacket and it rained about every 15
mins or so most everyday, but it wasn't too cold so that was no problem.  We
were shocked at how expensive all the tourist stuff was...30 DM per person
to go to the Aquarium!  Everything was like that, but we did all that we had
time for.  The riots on May 1st made us detour a little bit, so that we
didn't get to see the Crown Jewels, next time we will make that 1st on the
list.  We really enjoyed the parks, the pubs and Heather's company.  But we
aren't city people, we where ready to get out of the hustle and bustle and
come home to our boring little lives.  I loved the fish and chips that we
got at The Bag of Nails Pub, other than Pubs we mostly ate italian.  It was
cool seeing the Windsor Castle and all the old stuff.  Heather has a nice
flat, with a great location, right by Buckingham palace.  She's having a
blast there!  I would like to see the countryside next time.

Yeah, it's going to be awhile before you are more than ""just ok"".  I am very
sorry.  It's good that you are keeping busy.

so what are you going to do about your job?  I can honestly say I am happier
in this job than I've ever been...but the boss can be a little difficult
sometimes!!!

Gotta go for lunch! Write me!

"AAHHHHH!!","I just walked into the kitchen of the new house and a man was putting up a
stone wall????? I went and asked Armin why he was doing that..all the walls
that we need are already there??? He said it's for where the refrigerator
will be later.  WELL we had just decided yesterday to get a side by side and
it would go on a TOTALLY different wall!  Armin is obviously confused from
overwork!  He had the man tear it down, thank god it was still wet cemet.
He's making me VERY Nervous.

So what's planned for the weekend?  We have a 3 day one, holiday on Monday.
We're having our good by americans party tomorrow here at the
building...it's so sad to see them all go.

Today is ISOLDE's birthday (armin's mom) I'm not going there though..I think
I will just stay here and drink a glass of wine, you know...one I can enjoy
BECAUSE I AM NOT having to spend time with her.

"Important Notice - New eService Online on www.continental.com","Dear MR. Hendrickson,

We're Changing to Serve You Better

Next Wednesday evening, May 30, 2001, we are launching a new version of eService
Online, the web reservations system on continental.com.  Once the new version is
implemented, you will have access to new options and personalized features
tailored to meet your travel needs. In order to make this transition, we ask
that you carefully review and follow the suggestions listed below.

Here's What You Need To Know:

Your Profile
Your profile information, including your username (shendri) and password, has
been transferred to the new version of eService Online. To protect your personal
information, credit card information has not been transferred. You will need to
update your profile.

Your Itineraries
Information in your Saved Itineraries created on or before May 30 will not be
transitioned.  If you want to keep a copy for your records, print them prior to
6 p.m. CDT, May 30. This change does not affect the status of any reservations
and tickets, just your ability to view them in the new eService Online.

Signing In
To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to
reserve and purchase flights. This means you will have to use your password each
time. To have your password e-mailed to you visit
http://airmail.continental.com/cgi-bin5/flo?y=eD5l0EBYs0BUj0lrr0Am
You are strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging
process.

24-Hour Hold Option
To prepare for next Wednesday's release, we will turn off the ""Hold for 24
hours"" option. The ""Hold"" option will not be available between May 25 and May
30.

Here Are Some of the Changes

More eTicketing
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets
(eTickets). We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airlines
(CO2000-2349).

Aircraft Seat Maps
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat
selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating.

Pricing
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your
selection of either ""Search By Lowest Fares"" or ""Search By Schedule."" We also
added a gold star to denote ""continental.com promotional fares,"" so you know for
certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare.

Customer Service
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services.

While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new
version may not, on the surface, appear to be significantly different.  These
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the
future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on
feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.

We're confident you will appreciate the changes and improvements and we look
forward to continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

Continental Airlines, Inc.

Read Full Story   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Sony PC to offer DVD, TV recording  Sony Electronics unveiled Thursday a Vaio desktop computer that includes a DVD drive and TV tuner along with built-in recording technology. The Vaio Digital Studio PC features a Giga Pocket Personal Video Recorder and allows consumers to watch TV programs streamed from cable or other analog sources onto the monitor and to record home videos or TV programs onto the hard drive.  May 17, 2001, 8:40 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  AOL merger charges hit nearly $1 billion  Internet and media powerhouse AOL Time Warner expects to incur nearly $1 billion in restructuring charges tied to the merger that formed the company, according to its annual report filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the filing, AOL Time Warner, which has been operating as a joint entity for the past four months, said it recorded a restructuring liability of approximately $965 million during its first quarter.  May 17, 2001, 5:50 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  New Compaq PCs: More than meets the eye?  Compaq Computer may soon offer PC buyers a tempting option: two for the price of one. Hoping to corral buyers who can't decide whether to buy a notebook or desktop PC, the Houston-based computer maker is experimenting with a line of business notebooks that transform into desktop PCs. The PC is designed to fold over and create a stand for a 15-inch, flat-panel display with removable wireless keyboard and mouse.  May 17, 2001, 9:05 a.m. PT |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  Research In Motion files patent suit  Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry e-mail pager, lashed out at one of its competitors Thursday, saying it violates a U.S. patent recently granted to RIM. Ontario, Canada-based RIM charges in a suit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Delaware that Glenayre Technologies violates a patent protecting the way the BlackBerry redirects e-mail from a computer or server to a handheld using a single e-mail address. Charlotte, N.C.-based Glenayre already has a pending suit of its own against RIM.  May 17, 2001, 8:35 a.m. PT  |  Read Full Story  [IMAGE]  ""Mawanella"" worm sends political message  Hundreds of companies worldwide have fallen prey to another mass-mailing worm created by the virus toolkit that unleashed the AnnaKournikova worm, antivirus companies said Thursday. Called Mawanella--the name of a Sri Lankan village--the worm carries a Sri Lankan political message, but does no real damage besides clogging networks with e-mail.

Sharp's Mebius PC-SX1-H1 notebook, set for release June 30, will use Transmeta's 600MHz Crusoe processor. The Sharp announcement rounds out Transmeta's support by major Japanese notebook makers.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR SCOTT,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!

I just wish that I could do or say something that would make it a better day
for you.  It would be nice if we could at least go shopping, Home Depot, or
Target!  It always helps me to buy some plants or garden stuff when I'm down
and I would love to be able to go and do that with you.  But since I can't,
I can only send you good wishes and thoughts that your day is somehow a
happy one.

Connie, Armin and Angus

"WG: MORNING!","

So what's happening today?  Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim?
That's all so much fun.  I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting,
he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets
stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!! Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would
work to improve that one little imperfection.  And of course I need no
improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha
haaaa).  Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in
our eyes.

I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to
do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm
afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad
about that!  He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside
and dined on some M&M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like
5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on
my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night.

We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english.
I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the
thermals can go too.  I hope Julie has been having better weather in
Prague...but I think not.  Have ya'll heard from her?  I thought she might
call us since she's on the continent...

Did you tell her about talking to your parents?  She told me that she told
you her secret.  Were you surprised?  I actually guess who it was, but I was
surprised!  Last I heard she didn't know their status....did she ever find
out?

Well, write me!!!!

now!

sorry that things have not improved with rayfael...have you considered
getting out and seeing other folks.  I know you don't want too but it would
be good for you and you never know what a little jealousy can do...but I
don't mean Vincent.

workers have finished installing our toilet flushing system?? We have 6
toilets and they have been set up where they can be flushed with water from
our rainwater cistern (it holds like 30,000 gallons).  cool huh, water is so
expensive here and rain is free!  Armin is talking with the customers about
doing it, but they are thinking they want to wash their clothes with it
too...i don't think that's such a good idea, the water is not purified...but
the washingmachine does heat itself, it doesn't use a hot water heater...so
I ""guess"" it could be ok...

friends and contacts after a breakup is SO HARD!  You have a really great
attitude about all this and I know it must be incredibly hard!  It's so easy
to want to stay home and wait for the phone to ring...and so many times, it
doesn't.  Happy people attract other happy people.  Keep your chin up and
come visit us as soon as you can.

Armin has already met with the sprinkler people...so I think the grass (when
we plant it...Armin just told me it may be too late for this summer) will do
ok.  they have some really weird ideas about growing grass here???? But they
have alot of weird ideas about alot of things!!!

Please keep me posted about your mom and give her our best.  We think of her
daily, it's a huge challenge that she and your family have before them.

Tomorrow is a holiday...don#t know what holiday but some kind...so I think I
will open a bottle of wine for the boss and me, it's 6:30 pm and we can
sleep late...maybe to even 8 in the morning!   Problem is...I don't know
where he went, someone rang the office doorbell and he disappeared...that#s
the problem with this place...IT'S TOO BIG!  Angus and I run ourselves to
death trying to find each other!  Well, I just saw the landscaper's car
drive away, so maybe Armin will come back now....gotta open some wine!

"Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition","
After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our ""Ode to Why"" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the ""Leading Company in the World.""

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

"Notes from DTI Customer Meeting","DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement. The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. 
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.  
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.

Good evening!
Here is your Money Mail for Friday, June 8.

BUZZ AT THE BELL
Technology worries and technical difficulties conspired to
send stocks lower Friday. A profit warning from Juniper
Networks deflated telecom-equipment shares, while a
computer glitch halted New York Stock Exchange trading for
more than an hour.

Late in the session, the Nasdaq Composite stood 2.2-percent
lower, down 49 to 2,215. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 114 to 10,977 and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 12
to 1,265.

Shares of Juniper, which designs and sells products in
direct competition with networking behemoth Cisco, tumbled
more than 18 percent to 38.02. The company said its
second-quarter profits would disappoint investors and
announced layoffs of between 8 and 9 percent of its staff.
Cisco fell 6.1 percent and Redback Networks slid 7.6
percent to put a red exclamation point on a volatile week.

Many chip stocks also fell, partly in sympathy with their
networking brethren but also on profit-taking and lingering
fears about the future of chip demand. Intel lost 1.5
percent a day after it told analysts profits for its latest
quarter would be about what the company expected in its
last forecast. (Intel shares still finished up more than 7
percent for the week.) National Semiconductor fell 6.2
percent, but Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's biggest rival
in the microprocessor business, actually rose 2.7 percent.

Computer peripherals, cellular-phone companies and
specialty manufacturers rounded out the day's biggest
losers. Few sectors made any impressive headway. Gold
stocks jumped 4.6 percent but other gainers were up less
than 2 percent.

SCOUTING REPORT: NEXT WEEK
As punctuated by the Juniper warning, second-quarter
confession season has the market in its thrall. Keep a
close watch on conference calls and analyst meetings -- you
at least get a little warning before them. But there's no
way to brace for those pure, bolt-from-the-blue profit
warnings sure to come in the weeks ahead.

Economically speaking, inflation figures top next week's
calendar. The producer and consumer price indexes will be
released Thursday and Friday, respectively. Inflation has
become a back-burner issue, something the Federal Reserve
seems unconcerned about. But do keep an eye on
precious-metals stocks, which have risen in recent weeks
(though fallen back a bit lately). Rallying gold stocks
sometimes hint that investors are betting on an inflation
pickup.


ECONOMIC CALENDAR:
Wednesday
*Retail sales for May, forecast: +0.2 percent
Thursday
*Producer price index for May, forecast: +0.2 percent
*Weekly jobless claims, forecast: +410,000
Friday
*Consumer price index for May, forecast: +0.3 percent


STOCKS
* Intel's Visibility Only Half the Battle *
Investors applauded the chip giant's forecasting prowess
this week. But analysts say profit growth needs to pick up.

Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook
2001-06-02 17:26 (New York)

Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook

     Palatka, Florida, June 2 (Bloomberg) -- Natural gas is
burning again at Florida Power & Light Co.'s Putnam power plant in
Palatka.
     Last winter, Florida's largest utility reconfigured the plant
to run on fuel oil instead of natural gas, a cleaner-burning fuel
that for years had been comparatively cheap. Last month, as gas
prices plunged to a 10-month low, the plant switched back to gas.
     Florida Power & Light wasn't the only one. Many electric
utilities in the U.S. are able to burn both fuels, and several are
making the switch to gas, which is now cheaper than oil in some
regions. Companies such as Detroit Edison Co. had been burning oil
since the winter.
     ``It wasn't really until the early May timeframe, when gas
and oil prices crossed paths and gas became cheaper,'' that the
switch was made, said Gary Lapplander, the company's manager of
fuel supply. Michigan's largest electric utility had been running
its 780-megawatt Greenwood plant near Port Huron on oil since last
December.
     Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange to a record $10.10 per million
British thermal units in late December, more than quadruple the
year-earlier price. This year, prices have fallen below $4, partly
because last year's rally caused so many generators and industrial
customers to seek alternate fuels, such as oil.

                           Saving Money

     Fuel can account for more than 90 percent of a power plant's
operating costs, according to some estimates.
     Mild weather across the U.S. this spring has reduced demand
for gas to heat homes and power air conditioners, while record
drilling in the past year has led to higher gas flows from U.S.
wells. Since late March, utilities have been pumping gas into
underground storage at almost three times last year's rate,
according to American Gas Association figures.
     Fuel oil has a much different story. Prices for No. 6
residual fuel oil -- the grade most commonly burned in power
plants -- are linked to crude oil prices, which have climbed 4
percent this year.
     The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut
crude oil production twice this year after raising it four times
in 2000. And refiners have been sopping up supplies in recent
months to make gasoline for the summer driving season.
     Natural gas prices at Chicago's distribution hub fell below
fuel oil prices during the week ended May 18, the first time it
was cheaper in almost seven months, according to Bloomberg
figures. Fuel oil prices in Chicago are little changed this year.
     ``It's really a factor of economics,'' said Carol Clawson, a
spokeswoman for Juno Beach, Florida-based FPL Group Inc., parent
of Florida Power & Light, which can switch about a quarter of its
power plants between gas and oil on a few hours' notice. ``We are
detecting gas prices coming down, and as that occurs, we are going
back to gas.''

                          Fear of a Rally

     To be sure, some power-plant operators may be wary of
switching back to gas because of the chances for a rally this
summer, said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus in
New York. As hot weather arrives, homeowners and businesses will
turn up their air conditioners, pushing electricity use higher and
lifting gas demand. Natural gas futures last summer rose 29
percent.
     Adding to that demand, gas-fired power plants with about
25,000 megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer,
according to a U.S. Energy Department report published last month.
Last year, about 22,000 megawatts of new gas plants started up,
boosting total U.S. gas demand by 500 billion cubic feet, or 2.3
percent. A megawatt is enough to light 1,000 homes.
     Other variables in the gas market include the extent of any
heat waves this summer, and whether hurricanes will enter the Gulf
of Mexico, disrupting operations at offshore rigs that account for
a quarter of U.S. production.
     ``People don't fully trust gas,'' Evans said. ``They're
wondering if it's going to remain the cheaper fuel, or if it's
just going to turn around and do to them what it did last
winter.''

                           Still Cheaper

     Oil is still cheaper than gas in some regions. In the New
York City area, where utilities don't have to pay as much to get
oil delivered from tanker terminals in New York harbor, heavy fuel
oil costs $3.89 per million Btu, compared with $3.99 for natural
gas, according to Bloomberg figures.
     Even so, the drop in gas prices has prompted Brooklyn, New
York-based Keyspan Energy Corp. to increase gas's share of its
total power generation to about 40 percent, said company spokesman
David Manning. That's up from about 3.5 percent at one point last
December.
     Normally, almost all of the company's plants would be burning
gas at this time of year, Manning said. Keyspan produces power for
about 1.1 million customers on Long Island.
     ``We're right on the cusp'' of gas prices falling low enough
to switch the remainder of the company's generation away from oil,
he said. ``We would anticipate we will be running on gas even more
this summer, unless something dramatic happens with the weather.''

"AW: Morning!","It was so good to get your email and to hear that you are doing ""ok"".  I
think that is a GREAT idea about the dogs, if ya'll get back together.  They
would love doggie day care and be soooo tired at night that they would sleep
like logs.

I am so glad to hear that your parents are traveling.  what a beautiful time
to visit New England..did they drive or fly?

Things are fine here, the house is coming along now and we talked to a
landscaper about setting up our acre of yard...hopefully that will happen in
the next couple of weeks...WE NEED GRASS THIS YEAR!!!  We spent most of the
weekend with Christina and Mitch, they are transferred back to the states in
a month....we are all depressed about that, they love it here and don't want
to go...but when the military says JUMP, what else can you do???  We all
grilled out Sat with Lolo and family, he has his garten looking so?? fine
(we all are shocked at what he has been capable of...he built a wooden deck,
edged it in stone, filled the whole yard with dirt, planted a full yard of
shrubs, etc...THEN he layed a stone driveway and walk way...IT'S
BEAUTIFUL!!!

Then on Sun Christina, Mitch and us went to A?manns for lunch and started
having aperitiffs..they were so good and we were IN THE MOOD..so we had
more, then Herr A?mann treated us all to our favorite schnapps!  We were
feeling good by the time we left to go to our building and have MARGARITA'S
AND WINE!!! After sunning and drinking all day we feasted on a fleisch
dinner...that was all we had here to eat, so we grilled bauchfleisch, steaks
and bratw?rst...WE ATE SOOO MUCH, but we had DRANK SO MUCH THAT WE NEEDED
IT, good greasy stuff.  They left about 8pm and we went home to bed.  GREAT
DAY!  Wish so bad you could've been here!!!!

Today I worked all morning in the office, went home for lunch and we ate
outside on the terrace, then came back to the office and slept in my lounge
chair (with Angus in my lap) until Claudia woke me at 4 pm!  Just in time
for an appointment I had with one of our vendors over some bills.  the
appointment went well, we went home for dinner that Claudia made and now we
are back here at the office.  Armin has a bid to get out and Angus needed to
walk and visit with his dog friends, since he slept alllll afternoon!

Well, Armin says he's getting finished, so I better go water my flowers
outside before he's ready to head home...write me, write me...WRITE ME!!!

"YEA!!!!!!!!!","I'M SO EXCITED!!!! They are finally spreading out my land!  There's a HUGE
bulldozer out there and he's moving the dirt where-ever I tell him.  IT'S
GREAT, EARTH SCULPTING (???).  There will be some low levels, some high
levels and then some mounds...I have an acrea of dirt to play with...it's
like a great big sandbox!  I ALWAYS LOVED PLAYING IN THE DIRT!

And I am getting so excited about having a yard, ALLLLLL OUR OWN!  With no
tenants (Frau Sweetie) looking down at us.  Our only neighbor, that will
actually live on their land hasn't even started building yet.  They gave us
their plans for approval last week and they are building their house around
an atrium like area...so they won't even have any windows this way!

I needed something uplifting..I just finished calculating how much we pay
annually to the ins. company to be covered for everything....30,000 DM A
YEAR!  ONLY 14,000 is for the business!  I keep hoping that I can find
something to cancel...but no luck yet.

So what's happening???
