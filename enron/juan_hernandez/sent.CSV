Sent:	Monday, August 27, 2001 11:27 AM
To:	Hernandez, Juan; Miller, Jeffrey; Gilbert, Gerald; 'ksanders@entergy.com'
Subject:	From the Jim Rome Show talking about A & M



1) They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army, and red ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite UT. 
2) Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agriculture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from where they get that I don't now......the fact is, the State intended A&M to be a branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth from the original creation. Like Danny Devito in ""Twins"". 
3) So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good. All the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they won't shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how they want to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is the world's largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in everything A&M does. 
4) The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at A&M. There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp. East Texas' answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now, forget the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy. Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point is: We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however, nobody respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act like the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect these clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians, move to Israel. 
5) It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national television and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be against the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down upon. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have moved the game from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's Thanksgiving dinner. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil. 
6) ""t.u."" is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if folks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be funny. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it. Please learn. 
7) You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of sheep, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall down. Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit whooping in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for Governor. When you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form asks for your phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3"", Weight 185. Just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East Texas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade education why they cheer for A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base. This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid. 
8) Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder, they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. The point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about marching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college? 
9) Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe. Oh wait...I understand now. 
10) Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly. 
11) Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there. That should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get any better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending ""Dukes of Hazard"" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to Austin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open minded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool. As my friend Stephen Johnson once said: ""If the world were ever to get an enema, College Station is where you would connect the hose."" If you go to school at A&M, please don't be an Aggie.

Subject:	hourly checkout AECI HE 9 from 5-3-01

Kurt at AECI showed AECI purchasing 96 mws at $38 for HE 9.  The P&L showed this deal at $40.  I offered to meet in the middle at $39.  Kurt preferred to pull the tapes and review the deal with his day guy that did the deal.  This is a heads up on the situation.

FW:  A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY!
 
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
 
1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.
2.    When the cake says ""Happy  Birthday Mijo"" instead of the child's real name.
3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.
4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.    It's ""Mijo's"" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.
11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say ""Mira, tan cute!""
13.    Someone else says  ""I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.
14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, ""I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.""
15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.
18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.
21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior.
22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.    It's ""Mijo's"" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
 
Power to la Raza
 
I thought this was something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

"Fwd: A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY PARTY!","This is 80% true.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
 
1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.
2.    When the cake says ""Happy  Birthday Mijo"" instead of the child's real name.
3.    The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.
4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.    It's ""Mijo's"" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.
11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say ""Mira, tan cute!""
13.    Someone else says  ""I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.
14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, ""I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.""
15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.
18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.
21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el Junior.
22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.    It's ""Mijo's"" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.

I thought this was something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Everyone,
 
There has been a major shakeup at TRW.  I have always  worked for TRW Automotive Electronics.  Well, we just got told that we TRW  AE has been dissolved and no longer exists.  I support the Safety  & Security, along with some Body Control plants.  Well, now I am  supposed to be going to the division known as Occupant Safety Systems (Airbags  & Seatbelts).  I am not sure what is going to  happen........
