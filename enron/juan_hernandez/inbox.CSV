"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Entergy -- order on ancillary services filing (ER01-2214)","	Entergy filed proposed revisions to its pro forma OATT relating to Ancillary Services Schedules Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6, proposed to be effective August 1, 2001.  Entergy's basic premise is that the pro forma tariff and ancillary services established as part of Entergy's Open Access Transmission Tariff settlement in Docket No. ER95-112 should be changed.  Entergy states that current charges are based on the amount of energy transmitted by Entergy without regard to the amount of capacity and energy Entergy must maintain in order to provide these services, and that these charges should be capacity-based rather than energy-based.  

	EPMI -- among several other parties -- protested the filing.

	On July 25, FERC issued an order as follows:

	- Entergy must define the term ""integrated peak load.""  (In its answer to EPMI's protest, Entergy agreed to define the term as the customer's average load over the course of the hour as measured by the appropriate metering).

	- Issues related to Energy Imbalance Services must be set for hearing, as Entergy has not demonstrated that certain proposed penalties are appropriate.  (EPMI had objected specifically to the proposed CRP penalty).

	- Issues related to Spinning Reserves and Supplemental Reserves must also be set for hearing.

	Although most of Entergy's proposed provisions have been set for hearing, FERC is allowing the provisions to become effective August 1, subject to refund.  Additionally, Entergy asked for a settlement judge, so FERC ordered that one be appointed, and encouraged the parties to resolve their differences.  A settlement judge will be appointed by August 9 and will convene a settlement conference.  The judge must submit a report to the Commission by September 24.

	I will keep you updated.  Let me know if you would like further information.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"GMAT Review available at Enron","GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin the week of October 15th.
Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.  
			Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information.
	3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored.  
Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on awaiting list for the course or courses indicated.
Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"Security Coordinator Conference Call 10-16-01","Brief from today's (October 16) daily NERC Security Call:

NERC           -Continue in Alert level 2.5, something between full alert
status and heightened alert.
          - CIPWG continues to work on level definitions.  Still a week or
two away from completion.

NIPC      - Reported possible bomb threat at Nuclear Plant in ERCOT.
However, ERCOT reports that security at Plant was unaware of threat.

DOE       - Continue at SECON level 3 modified.  Note:  SECON-3 is used
          when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist
          activity exists and may increase access controls to include
          additional personnel and vehicle barriers.

SC's      -A suspcious substance received in the mail forced a Mid-Atlantic
          Electric Utility to evacuate their control center.  Local
          authorities determined the substance to be non-toxic and allowed
          all personel to return to the building.
          -Two unidentified indivduals tried to gain access to a Midwest
          EHV station via the station gate.  They escaped without being
          apprehended.
          -A Power Plant in the Southwest recieved a phone call in which
          the caller stated ""you are being watched.""  The caller then
          hanged-up.
          -A Power Plant in the Southwest reported that two suspcious
          people showed up at the Plant gate stating that they were college
          students and that they wanted a tour of the Plant.  The security
          guard refused them access and asked them to leave.  They refused
          to leave.  The guard went to his truck to radio the situation in,
          at which time the suspects fled.  Their vehicle had no plates on
          the front and the guard was unable to read the rear plate.


ECAR/MET Security Coordinator suggests that ECAR members continue to
evaluate their security measures and take action that they deem appropriate
to protect the system and their investment.  ECAR/MET reminds the ECAR
members that if Federal Agencies discover that one of your facilities is
the target of a credible threat, that they will notify you directly of such
threat.  You are asked to notify the ECAR/MET Security Coordinator of any
and all suspicious activities that occur on or near critical transmission
facilities and power plants, as well as the appropriate law enforcement
authorities.

For all of you who are active participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, we have made arrangements with Northern Trust, our Plan Administrator, to expedite any loan requests made during the week of June 18 - June 29 in order to help you during this recovery period from any flood damage you may have experienced.

If you do not already have an outstanding loan, you can request up to 50% of your balance up to a maximum of $50,000.  To request a loan follow these three easy steps in order to ensure quick processing:

	1. Log onto the website:   https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/# or call the Benefits Service Center at 713.853.7979.

	2. Enter your SSN and your Personal Identification Number and click on ""Loan Information"" to see the amount available.

On Friday (9/14) and Saturday (9/15) Clarksdale will be removing the 115 kV from HE 0800 - 1700.  The reason is to install some poles for the Aquila project across the street.  This outage will cause them to become an island from the grid.  They will generate their own power to meet their load.  They will have units 8, 9, and 6.  They will baseload 8 and 6 and regulate with 9.

Commonwealth Edison Company.  ER00-3668-001.  Settlement Issues.  Commonwealth Edison proposed to install equipment at its East Frankfort substation (East Frankfort) to accommodate the 138 kV interconnection of University Park's 300 MW peaking generation facility.  Under the agreements, University Park is wholly responsible for the costs of relocating two 345 kV transmission lines and one 12 kV line at East Frankfort. On November 8, 2000, FERC accepted and suspended Commonwealth Edison's September 12 agreements, subject to refund and subject to Commonwealth Edison making a compliance filing to: 1) set out specific charges for the proposed interconnection of University Park's generation facility (together with supporting documentation); and 2) provide support for the proposed direct assignment of facilities to University Park.  On June 4, 2000, regarding Commonwealth Edison's revisions to its unexecuted interconnection agreement filed in compliance with FERC's November 8 order, FERC: 1) accepted the proposed charge of $900,000 for a T-tap connection and $300,000 ($1.2 million) for protective relaying as directly assignable to University Park; 2) rejected Commonwealth Edison's estimated $9 million for the enhancement of East Frankfort and other changes to the September 12 interconnection agreement not contemplated in the November 8 order; and 3) rejected Commonwealth Edison's proposed $1.5 million charge related to the line relocation costs, set this matter for hearing, and held the hearing in abeyance pending settlement discussions between the parties.  On June 12, the Chief Judge issues an order designating a settlement judge, Judge Jacob Leventhal, and directing him to convene a settlement conference, to explore the possibility of settlement, to discuss the differences between the parties, and in general to conduct the settlement negotiations.  Chief Judge also directs all parties to have persons present at the settlement negotiations with authority to negotiate and accept or approve settlement terms. Chief Judge explains that Judge Leventhal will be available to meet with the parties individually or in groups, in person or by telephone prior to the conference.  Further, he states that a settlement conference will convene in a FERC hearing room on June 21, 2001 at 10:00 A.M.

Fred,

Here's the info you requested.

On June 15th we offered 5 MW's of ICAP into the NYISO auction for $4.00/kw-month for four months.  We were taken for 4 months (July thru Oct) for $5.00/kw-month, $5.50/kw-month, $5.00/kw-month, and $5.00/kw-month respectively.

The July and August ICAP invoices include all of EES's ICAP purchases and sales and does not separate the IBM capacity. I have sent you a hard copy.

Gus Hernandez (EES services) prepared the billing statement for IBM.  Jeff Nieland (Service Mgr for IBM) has been involved throughout the process.

Mary Hannush (Settlements) furnished the NYISO invoice info.

Thanks - Jeff

"Important Message","It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

"MISO Losses - MORE News","After talking further with MISO folks about the new attachment M, it appears that the MISO will _effectively_ be requiring physical losses, although they don't come out and say that. Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we ""may"" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service.

In more detail, this is how the process will work:

TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs
If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses
If not, the TC will be required to self supply

TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"Associate & Analyst Mid-Year 2001 PRC Process","To all supervisors of Associates and Analysts

The Associates and Analysts will be divided into 4 final ranking meetings for the mid-year 2001 PRC.  These meetings are scheduled as follows:
EES Associate & Analyst Final Meeting - June 8
EBS Associate & Analyst Final Meeting - June 19
EWS/Others* Associate & Analyst Final Meeting - June 25
EA Associate & Analyst Final Meeting - July 9

*(EWS/Others includes Associates and Analysts from EWS, EGM, APACHI, CALME, CORP, ECM, EIM, EIP, ENW, ESA, ETS, EOTT, HPL, PGE, EWC, Japan, and EnronCredit).

The Associates and Analysts will be ranked within the following Peer Groups:
Analyst 1 - Analysts with up to one year of service (hired between 3/1/00 and 2/28/01)
Analyst 2 - Analysts with greater than one year of service (hired prior to 3/1/00)
Associate - All Associates hired prior to 3/1/01

Associate and Analyst Ranking Process
Analysts and Associates hired on or after 3/1/01, will receive feedback only, all others will receive both a PRC ranking and feedback.
Each Business Unit Supervisor will be responsible for providing a pre-ranking to the PRC Rep.  The PRC Reps have access to the consolidated feedback for each assigned Associate and Analyst.  Please be sure that you have met with the assigned PRC Rep prior to the final Associate and Analyst meeting for your business unit.  (Your business unit HR department may choose to set up pre-ranking meetings - check with your HR representative).  The final ranking for each Analyst an Associate will be determined through a cross calibration in each of the final meetings.  In these final meetings, the Analysts and Associates will be represented by a PRC Rep from their Business Unit who should be familiar with their accomplishments.

Associate and Analyst PRC Reps
Please refer to the attached spreadsheet for a list of Associates and Analysts who will be ranked in these meetings and their PRC Reps.

Contact me at extension 35230 if you have any additional questions.

"Dynegy complaint against SPP (EL01-104)","	
On July 17 , 2001, Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. filed a complaint against the Southwest Power Pool, Inc.  Dynegy alleges that the SPP has violated its OATT by unreasonably restricting Point-to-Point Transmission Services customers' right to change of receipt and delivery points on a firm basis.  Specifically, Dynegy complains that SPP unfairly limits changes of receipt and delivery points to those that permanently redirect the reservation (i.e., for the balance of the reservation term).  Dynegy documents several specific instances in which its redirect requests were automatically denied.

I will keep you updated on this proceeding; if you would like more details on the complaint in the meantime, please let me know.

Subject:	NERC To Shut Down Access to CRC Data

NERC staff has been requested by MAPP to immediately shut down the Central Repository (CRC) for flows data.

This is the data that OATI polls from to post flowgate data for transmission customers to use in assessing path availability.

MAPP's request is driven by fears of terrorist use of this information to disable the grid.

The shutdown may occur immediately.  NERC will install a more secure registration procedure to control access to this data, possibly as early as Oct 1.  This may or may not resolve MAPP's concerns.

I opposed NERC shutting this down in such an authoritary manner citing the importance of this information to trading.  
Please notify those who may be impacted by the inability to access this data.  I will pass on any new information as I receive it.

Twisted statistics:

Number of physicians in the US: 700,000.

Accidental deaths caused by physicians per year: 120,000.

Accidental deaths per physician.... 0.171 (U.S. Dept. of Health & Human

"Grid South RTO Order Voted out today","At today's FERC meeting, the Commission voted out a draft order in GridSouth's RTO proceeding.  The original March 14, 2001 order accepted the GridSouth ""Order No. 2000 compliance filing"" subject to modifications and requiring meetings with Santee Cooper to achieve their participation in the RTO.  Today's order denies rehearing and grants clarification.  Following is a brief summary of the pertinent points of the order.

The order requires that all terms, rates and conditions must be on file with the FERC.  The original order recognized GridSouth as the sole provider of transmission service on its grid, requiring all uses under the GridSouth tariff.   The RTO applicants requested  clarification that the FERC was not requiring unbundling of retail rates.  They had intended to place their bundled retail load under the GridSouth Tariff for terms and conditions, but not rates.  The rehearing order does not assert jurisdiction over bundled retail rates, however GridSouth is now the sole provider of transmission service and the applicants must take all transmission services, including transmission underlying bundled retail service from GridSouth.  Therefore, the order requires all terms, conditions and rates to be on file at FERC.  
All specific rate issues will be deferred until GridSouth files a Section 205 filing.  This allows a possibility that GridSouth could file different rates for native load and FERC jurisdictional transmission services.  It is not clear what the FERC will do with this issue.
GridSouth will initially operate three control areas.  A request by Joint Protesters to integrate resources and loads anywhere on the system and allow netting of imbalances over all CAs was denied because Order No. 2000 did not require a single control area.  However to allow one-stop shopping, the Commission is requiring a single agreement which can contain information for each delivery zone.  (Compliance is required in 10 days.)
Though the Commission did not require netting over all control areas now, the order did suggest that GridSouth should give consideration, in consultation with parties, of mechanisms to minimize energy imbalances on an RTO-wide basis through either operational or trading mechanisms.
Defers issues relating to ancillary services and Hourly Imbalance charge until supplemental filing.
Denies rehearing request of Santee Cooper asking the FERC to find that unlimited passive ownership compromises the independence of an RTO and should not be allowed.  The order finds that a case-by-case review is appropriate where the RTO Applicants have an opportunity to show the passive ownership proposal is designed to protect the financial interests of the passive owners but does not allow TO control of the RTO decision making process.
Allows right of first refusal of existing GridSouth members to purchase new equity interests issued by the Board until the Initial Public Offering, in order to protect existing members against dilution of the value of their membership interests in case the Board were to issue new equity at too low a price.
The Commission does reiterate that its goal is the formation of a single RTO in the Southeast.  Scope and configuration will be addressed in a separate order in review of the May 14 filing.  
Denies EPMI's request for a settlement judge proceeding.  
Denies EPMI's request for rehearing on conditioning market-based rate authority on RTO participation.
Denies EPMI's requested clarification that GridSouth cannot incur significant start-up costs before the independent Board is seated.  The order notes that GridSouth represents it will not incur significant costs for software or hardware for real-time balancing until approved by an independent Board.

Commonwealth Edison Company.  ER00-3668-001.  Settlement Issues.  Commonwealth Edison proposed to install equipment at its East Frankfort substation (East Frankfort) to accommodate the 138 kV interconnection of University Park's 300 MW peaking generation facility.  Under the agreements, University Park is wholly responsible for the costs of relocating two 345 kV transmission lines and one 12 kV line at East Frankfort. On November 8, 2000, FERC accepted and suspended Commonwealth Edison's September 12 agreements, subject to refund and subject to Commonwealth Edison making a compliance filing to: 1) set out specific charges for the proposed interconnection of University Park's generation facility (together with supporting documentation); and 2) provide support for the proposed direct assignment of facilities to University Park.  On June 4, 2000, regarding Commonwealth Edison's revisions to its unexecuted interconnection agreement filed in compliance with FERC's November 8 order, FERC: 1) accepted the proposed charge of $900,000 for a T-tap connection and $300,000 ($1.2 million) for protective relaying as directly assignable to University Park; 2) rejected Commonwealth Edison's estimated $9 million for the enhancement of East Frankfort and other changes to the September 12 interconnection agreement not contemplated in the November 8 order; and 3) rejected Commonwealth Edison's proposed $1.5 million charge related to the line relocation costs, set this matter for hearing, and held the hearing in abeyance pending settlement discussions between the parties.  On June 12, the Chief Judge issues an order designating a settlement judge, Judge Jacob Leventhal, and directing him to convene a settlement conference, to explore the possibility of settlement, to discuss the differences between the parties, and in general to conduct the settlement negotiations.  Chief Judge also directs all parties to have persons present at the settlement negotiations with authority to negotiate and accept or approve settlement terms. Chief Judge explains that Judge Leventhal will be available to meet with the parties individually or in groups, in person or by telephone prior to the conference.  Further, he states that a settlement conference will convene in a FERC hearing room on June 21, 2001 at 10:00 A.M.

"New Options Model","
---------------------- Forwarded by Tamara Jae Black/HOU/ECT on 05/22/2001 04:18 PM ---------------------------
From:	Steve Wang/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/22/2001 04:17 PM

Subject:	New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and will eventually have them on a daily basis.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

To Our Valued  Traffic Report Clients,
 
Today, FriedWire's  Traffic Report experienced a disruption in service as a result of network and  general connectivity problems caused by third parties.  We apologize for  this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this  does not happen again.  As always, we remain committed to providing you  power markets information around-the-clock. 
Product Update 
FriedWire has just added significant new content and  capability to the Traffic Report, which areoutlined below.  Please contact us for  brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. 
NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather  Forecasts 
    3-7 day Maximum Temperatures  
    6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability  
    8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly  
    Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed  above) 
    Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies 
***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification  services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't  have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. 
Available Transmission Capacity  
FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for  available transmission by path.  The new geographic interface will allow  you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate  to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from  non-path providers and more. 
***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification  services are now available along with the new ATC interface.  Now, you can  be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that  you track ongoingly.  You can custom define your alerts according to the  provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're  interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the  week, time of day, times per day, etc.). 
The following additional product upgrades have been  deployed: 
All hourly offerings are now reflected in military  time designations. 
Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range  (i.e.; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. 
Eight new flowgates have been added for  Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy.  They all have  Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting ""View All Interties"".   All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of  weeks. 
 You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and  text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic  Report.  Simply click on the link that says ""My Account"" at the top  right-hand corner of any Traffic Report screen and look for the link just to  the right of the E-mail * input field that says Enter additional  e-mails.  Go to the Add an E-mail Contact link at the bottom of the next  screen. 

We hope you enjoy and find useful the new version of  the Traffic Report.  Please stay tuned for more exciting additions in the  near future. 
Sincerely, 
Bill Townsend 
President 
FriedWire Inc.

Subject:	New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and will eventually have them on a daily basis.

"Nobody scheduled on day shift Sunday October 28th","Hey Juan,

There is nobody scheduled to work the day shift for Sunday 10/28 (next weekend).  I am the only person working the Saturday (day shift) before on the 27th so it looks like I'd be the logical person to fill.  However, for me to do that I'd be working 14 out of 16 days in a row, including 6 straight days in a row.  I'd be fine with filling the schedule if I could possibly get the 30-31st off (or even just the 30th) as I am currently set to work the 30th through the 2nd.  Since I probably won't see you until next week, I thought I should let you know in advance about the problem. 

Please let me know what you would like me to do.  

Thanks,
Carrie

"Reminders for Night Shift","I have a couple REMINDERS for all staff on the 24 Hour Desk.

1.  There MUST be a cut note created for each occurrence of a curtailment and posted on the Discussion Forum in Lotus Notes.

2.  The Shift Note should also be posted on the Discussion Forum each morning.

3.  Make sure you get a good hand-off from the departing staff, Day or Night Shift, example: what is the desk position, current deals, who is buying/selling, transmission trouble.

4.  Keep good personal notes on trades.

5. Identify what type of product you are buying/selling; Non-firm, Trans. Contingent, TLR Contingent # MW @ $, for each trade.

6.  Continue to import power into PJM in the morning until future notice.

7.  Hammer the phones, call utilities that you don't normally call, try new deal structures and new directions.

The winter is not far away, therefore we must be ready to profit from the morning and late afternoons volatility.

Give me a call on my cell phone if you have any questions.

Thanks,

"FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel","

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

"Xcel Energy Inc. to Northern States Power Company","On Aug. 18, 2000, New Century Energies, Inc. and Northern States Power Company (NSP) merged and formed Xcel Energy Inc.  

As part of the merger, NSP transferred its existing utility operations that were being conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed subsidiary of Xcel Energy named Northern States Power Company.

Because of the merger, the record was overlayed in Global Counterparty and all history for Northern States Power Company is now under Xcel Energy.  A new Northern States Power Company record has been created in Global.  I will be moving all Xcel deals with a July 1, 2001 forward flow date to the newly created record for Northern States Power Company.  Xcel Energy will be inactivated in Enpower.  

Please choose Northern States Power Company (NORTHERNST) for future deals with this counterparty.

"FW: RATA and Compliance Testing","Juan,

Per the e-mail below, New Albany is requesting the dispatch of two units (120 MW) for 10 to 12 hours on Aug 14, 15, 16 & 17 for Permit testing.  This testing is necessary.  Please advise if this is a problem.

Subject:	RATA and Compliance Testing

Rick,

New Albany Power I, LLC will be required to perform RATA and Stack testing this year in the 3rd Quarter to meet the requirements of the Air Permit and the CFR. They will be performed together and require 1 day of testing per two units. The stack testing requires three- one hour runs at base load and then to complete the RATA we will be required to run for an additional six - twenty minute runs. The testing is scheduled for the week of August 13, 2001 to coinside best with all parties schedules. The actual testing times will be August 14, 2001 for units 5 and 6, August 15, 2001 for units 3 and 4, and August 16, for units 1 and 2. We have one extra day scheduled which is August 17, 2001 to complete an additional lenearity test which is also required by the permit and the CFR. The required pre testing notification has been submitted to the MDEQ.

It will require at least 10 hours on each unit to complete the test due to stabalization of the monitoring equipment between the test runs. Therefore, I would like to request a 10 to 12 hour dispatch for two units on August 14th, 15th, and 16th to perform the testing.

Please let me know if we can get the dispatch on the requested day to perform the testing.

Thank You 
James Goins

"Curtailments of Stacked Transmission","Attached is a presentation for your review that illustrates a new method for curtailment of transactions that is still based on CPM, but give partial-credit for varying levels of firmness in a stack.

As you probably know, when a transaction leg is supported by multiple transmission reservations it is referred to as a ""stack"" of transmission; specifically, a vertical stack.  Under the current curtailment procedures under which we operate, such a stack is always valued at the LOWEST curtailment priority of the stack.  In other words, if I combine 50MW of firm transmission and 50MW of Non-Firm Secondary, my 100MW of transmission capacity is now treated as if it ALL had a curtailment priority of 1.  Further, if an off-path constraint occurs, the entire transaction is treated with a priority of 1, even if every other leg is Firm.

As I'm sure you can see, this stinks.  So I have drafted up a proposal for what I think is a better way of doing this.  Under the proposal, 50MW would be treated as priority 1, while the other 50 would be treated as Firm.  This would reduce the SIZE on-path curtailments and off-path curtailments.  As far as whether it increases or decrease the NUMBER of transactions curtailed, that will depend on several different factors (how prevalent stacking is, how often stacks vary in firmness, etc...).

Please review and give comments, as I plan to present to the IDCWG in a few weeks.  It is my opinion that this is a good idea, but I want to make sure you all (and any others you think should be asked) agree.

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach of the Loan Program.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"RE: November and December Vacation","Juan,
As far as the holidays go, I don't really care one way or the other.  If you need me to work I will, but if somebody else really wants the extra money I don't mind not working.  If I had my preference I would rather work Christmas than Thanksgiving so I could go to College Station and watch the Aggies smack around the over-rated Longhorns (be sure to show that part to Reece).  As far as vacation I would like to take off Nov. 2-5 and then maybe some time around Thanksgiving if I'm off.  I still have all of my vacation and I'm not sure how much I can carry over.  One other thing, some buddies of mine are going to Vegas the weekend of Oct. 27, I'm scheduled to work Sat. Night with two other guys, I would take a vacation day that day if you think we can get by with just two people on a Sat night.  Anyway, I'm not real particular, if you need me to work I'll be there if not then I won't.  See you Thur.

Subject: November and December Vacation


Hey guys and girls with the Holiday's fast approaching I am looking for a good few men and women to work the holidays.  These volunteers can work the Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas and New Years day.  You can work all of these days or just some of them.  Keep in mind that holiday pay is involved.  Let me know your preferences when you e-mail me your response.  If I get more volunteers than we need, then we will draw straws on who gets to work what holidays.  Also please e-mail your vacation request if you have any for the November and December Schedule.  The sooner I get everyones response the faster I can get the schedules out for November and December.  I almost forgot, in your e-mail let me know much you would like to work the holidays: very much, don't care one way or another, or don't want to work them at all.    That is all!!!

"Southeast Region RTOs","The Commission at today's FERC meeting voted out orders in the three Southeast region RTOs - Grid South, SETrans and SPP.  It was reported at the meeting that the orders will find that it is necessary for a single Southeast region RTO.  A separate order will be issued in a new docket RT01-100 initiating mediation before an ALJ (Judge Bobbie McCartney) to facilitate the formation of the single Southeast RTO.  Within one week, the settlement proceeding will begin and will continue for 45 days.  The judge thereafter must report to the Commission within 10 days including an outlline of a Southeastern RTO, milestones for completion of intermediate steps and a deadline for submitting a joint proposal.  The Commission will review the report and may issue further orders as needed.  

Grid South, SE Trans and SPP are required to participate and Grid Florida is encouraged to participate in the mediation.  All parties to any of these RTOs should also participate.

The Grid South order will also include language requiring an independent board.  After the independent board is established, it should choose an operator of the RTO.  This language should further support the idea set out in a prior SPP order granting Enron's clarification that the RTO should not make major capital expenditures for software or operating systems prior to the establishment of an independent board.

The Grid South order should also include language supporting the establishment of interconnection standards.

"From the Jim Rome Show talking about A & M","

1) They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and old army, and red ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat UT, and blah blah blah. Shut up. You start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite UT. 
2) Forget the fact that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agriculture and mechanics. Aggies love to say their school is older, from where they get that I don't now......the fact is, the State intended A&M to be a branch of UT. They are like the afterbirth from the original creation. Like Danny Devito in ""Twins"". 
3) So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to UT that they are just as good. All the while, nobody at UT denies that A&M is a good school, yet they won't shut up. So they write a fight song......about?....Texas, and how they want to beat them. They have a Fish Camp for freshman where they tell them how bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It is the world's largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested in everything A&M does. 
4) The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at A&M. There are some nice people there. However...there is the Corp. East Texas' answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his GI Joe Toys, there is the Corp. Now, forget the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if they agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corps looked like a Gestapo hate rally while beating down students on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past month have had one Corps member bring charges against another Corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for a little actual sodomy. Not only could I go on with more instances of idiocracy by these Khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point is: We all respect West Point, Annapolis, The Air Force Academy; however, nobody respects the Corp. I imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world. Just because you dress like the Army, and try and act like the Army, does not make you the Army. People at A&M don't even respect these clowns. It is not cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians, move to Israel. 
5) It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national television and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be against the law. I know that in College Station, students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down upon. Especially if you are doing it on my TV. That is why we have moved the game from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's Thanksgiving dinner. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil. 
6) ""t.u."" is not funny. It is NOT insulting. It is dumb. Just imagine if folks from Texas kept talking about M&A and giggling. That would not be funny. In fact, it would be retarded. That's why UT fans don't do it. Please learn. 
7) You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of sheep, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall down. Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national TV. Quit whooping in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights practicing how to yell. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're running for Governor. When you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the form asks for your phone #, H & W, quit putting 258-3999, Height 6'3"", Weight 185. Just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to East Texas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade education why they cheer for A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base. This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid. 
8) Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder, they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. The point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. Quit getting geeked up about marching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college? 
9) Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe. Oh wait...I understand now. 
10) Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly. 
11) Finally, College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that it is a great college town. It is a town and there is a college there. That should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get any better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending ""Dukes of Hazard"" episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to Austin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and open minded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool. As my friend Stephen Johnson once said: ""If the world were ever to get an enema, College Station is where you would connect the hose."" If you go to school at A&M, please don't be an Aggie.

Lloyd the following people were let go last week from the OPS Group in EES and in redeployment.  I met them last week when I talked to John Wack their Director when I moved to 3AC.  John, worked with our group when he was in the Risk Group for EES and we were managing the utilities audits for customers.
  
Since everything in this company is about networking - I agreed to forward these to you.  Feel free to handle accordingly.

Again, thanks for the time lst week, I'll fill you in on my status as we get closer to the end-date of August 10th.

Dave,
   
   Attached is my resume.  I am interested in getting into the hourly trading area in particular ERCOT region.  I understand that you may know the Director of this region.  I would really appreciate if you could forward my credentials to him.  My most recent experience has been in power contracts analysis / pricing  and previously  trading and scheduling natural gas for the California markets for EES & ENA.  

Recently, I have had a chance to sit with the Steve Olinde and Joe Errigo to familiarize myself with the group and the job.  It was a great exposure and I am eager to talk to someone from that area.  

Again, I appreciate your help.  Thank you.

"","Hi Deskmates,

Owing to the multiplicity of Logins and Passwords and URLs we are priviliged to be constantly cognisant of, I am attempting to put together and organize most of the mission critical stuff that otherwise we have had to wade around and find.

The idea here is to put together URLs, Logins and Passwords, instructions from Don or Juan and ANY OTHER stuff that u might  think would make our lives marginally comfortable while tooling away at our trades. 

I plan to do this on an ongoing basis and at no time do I think the organization will be ever considered 'over' so to speak. I would, with due permission of course, try and permanently enshrine this somewhere in M drive at a later date.

So pls feel completely free to drown, deluge me with stuff u wud like to see in such place yourself. 

Happy organized working!!

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: November and December Vacation


Hey guys and girls with the Holiday's fast approaching I am looking for a good few men and women to work the holidays.  These volunteers can work the Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas and New Years day.  You can work all of these days or just some of them.  Keep in mind that holiday pay is involved.  Let me know your preferences when you e-mail me your response.  If I get more volunteers than we need, then we will draw straws on who gets to work what holidays.  Also please e-mail your vacation request if you have any for the November and December Schedule.  The sooner I get everyones response the faster I can get the schedules out for November and December.  I almost forgot, in your e-mail let me know much you would like to work the holidays: very much, don't care one way or another, or don't want to work them at all.    That is all!!!

This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and ""other regional transmission organization functions.""  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

"FW: Power World Training","Folks,

Please let Lance and myself know if any of you are interested in attending the Power World training.  Power World provides visual representation of an optimal power flow model that can help make decisions regarding potential TLR's and price impacts of congestion.  We have the program now and the intent is to make more use of it over the next few months and as RTO's and congestion pricing becomes more prevalent.  

Thanks,

Tom.

On Thursday (6/28), we will begin at 11:00 AM and end about 4:00 PM.

"ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes","
INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing

Everyone is aware of the new Entergy tariff that has caused frustration for MDEA.  The tariff is under appeal and money is subject to refund.  However, We need a plan of action to develop as many possible options for MDEA to chose from in case the tariff stands.

"SPP RTO","The following is a summary of filings by Entergy and SPP in compliance with FERC's March 28, 2001 order in the SPP Partnership RTO proceeding (Dockets Nos. RT01-43-000 and RT01-75-000).

Please communicate any comments you have to Christi and me either today or Monday.  

Background:  FERC found the SPP Partnership RTO proposal to be deficient and ordered the parties to provide additional information.  In compliance, Entergy and SPP made filings on May 25, 2001.

Entergy's compliance filing

Entergy's filing provides further information on 1) efforts to expand the scope of the RTO (i.e., include others besides Entergy and the Southwest Power Pool), 2) details of the operation of the RTO and 3) congestion management.

1.  Entergy's efforts to expand the RTO:  Discussions with Southern Companies were fruitless as the Southern Companies have determined to pursue the development of a separate RTO.  Entergy entered into an MOU with TVA to negotiate a coordination agreement to address market, seams and coordination issues between TVA and the RTO.  Entergy concludes that ""there does not appear to be an opportunity at this time to develop a combined regional transmission organization that extends beyond the borders of the current SPP members and Entergy,"" though it claims it will continue to pursue an MOU with the Southern Companies.

2.  Proposed RTO protocols:  The filing includes the details of proposed protocols that Entergy and SPP have developed in the following areas:  

	Operating procedures:  The procedures require Transco to operate the system in accordance with NERC operating policy and authorize Transco to perform the post-contingency actions to maintain system security.

	Ancillary services:   Transco and SPP are each responsible for providing certain ancillary services.  In addition, Transco will obtain and provide to transmission customers other ancillary services such as Black Start Service and Reliability Must Run Service.

	Scheduling:  A single electronic scheduling system called the RTO_SS will be run by the SPP.  The RTO_SS, which is initiated by the NERC E-tag, provides an electronic mechanism for approval and coordination of schedules among the parties to the transaction.  RTO_SS interfaces with OASIS to retrieve the necessary information to approve schedules.

	OASIS Protocol:  SPP and Transco will operate a unified OASIS site; the respective responsibilities of SPP and Transco are detailed in the filing.

	Calculation of ATC:  SPP and Transco will use a single model incorporating the most up-to-date VST (VACAR, Southern, TVA) model into the SPP model for calculating ATC and TTC.  The protocol contains procedures to ensure that the calculations meet certain requirements, for example, compliance with NERC principles, consistency with transmission rights, and coordination with adjoining reliability regions.

	System Planning:  Entergy describes its system planning process as ""designed to ensure transmission system reliability and non-discriminatory access to the transmission system.""  The planning and expansion process provides for customer input.  The protocol emphasizes coordination with RTO members and non-members.  Transco will be responsible for coordinating planning with transmission customers and other entities within its Control Area.

	Generation Interconnection:  Entergy and SPP propose to use their current interconnection procedures for their respective systems while they develop a common set of procedures for the RTO.  The filing includes proposed interconnection procedures that the RTO plans to have in place before initial operations begin.

	Dispute Management:  The filing includes a comprehensive planning dispute management system for use with the proposed RTO transmission planning process.

3.  Congestion Management and Market Design

	The filing includes proposed ""cornerstone principles"" for 1) the real-time market, 2) the forward market and 3) conversion of existing transmission rights.  Details of these principles are as follows:

	Real-time market:  Entergy and SPP do not propose any specific plan except that the following general principles will be used by the SPP to design the real time market:

		- support balanced/unbalanced and covered/uncovered schedules that flow load to take full advantage of spot market resources

		-  support forward physical transmission rights that function as financial rights and establish priority in cases of TLR

		-  support real-time LMP pricing as ex-post based on actual total demand and actual total generation

		-  support the real-time market as an aggregation of  bilateral and spot supplies

		-  support the RTO's role as physical coordinator responsible for reliability, scheduling, dispatch and SPP load forecasting

		-  minimize the RTO's need to take a position in the real-time energy markets

	Forward market:  SPP will issue Financial Congestion Hedges.  Schedules and physical delivery will be permitted without rights.  The holder of an FCH will be paid rents or revenues collected from the transmission customer minus payments made to generators to relieve congestion.  

	Conversion of existing transmission rights:  Existing agreements will not lose benefits.  All firm wholesale and retail customers will be entitled to a share of the FCHs.  All transmission service with the point of withdrawal inside SPP will have the same priority of service.  All transmission service with the point of withdrawal inside SPP will be curtailed on a non-discriminatory basis.

SPP's compliance filing

	SPP's filing includes information that SPP claims demonstrates that the RTO satisfies the Commission's scope and configuration requirements.  

	- SPP submitted data on wholesale energy transactions involving the SPP RTO companies, in an attempt to show that the proposed RT will be able to accommodate the full markets.

	- It also submitted data showing the relative insignificance of non-Entergy SERC transactions to SPP.

	- SPP's description of its attempts to include Southern and TVA were similar to that of Entergy.  SPP states it will continue seams discussions with other regions.

	- SPP also reported on the Section 203 applications of SPP Transmission Owners as required by the Commission.

NERC ANNOUNCEMENT

We are pleased to PRE-announce significant enhancements to the NERC CRC

Internet site.

CRC provides information to the Electricity Industry:

1.  NERC Eastern Interconnection Transmission Loading Relief events.

2.  NERC Energy Emergency Alerts.

3.  Data on key flowgates.

4.  The Transaction Distribution Factor viewer.

5.  The Generator Shift Factor viewer.

6.  Links to factor and document files.

The existing site:

< <http://crc.nerc.com>>

will remain active as the official updated functional site until the

cutover, which is tentatively planned for the evening of Tuesday 07

August 2001; during the cutover there will be a planned outage of the

CRC site for a short time, expected to be no longer than one hour.

The new site will have the same URL.

The beta site is available for your inspection until the cutover:

< <http://crc2.nerc.com>>

You are encouraged to check this out and to review the changes in

format. There will likely be some continuing work and the exact

appearance may be altered somewhat prior to the cutover. Please note

that download files are available under the new heading ""Downloads"".

Thank you, and questions can be directed to NERC at:

609-452-8060

ERCOT has been improperly identified as the Source Generator and Load or Sink Entity on NERC Tags.  ERCOT does not own generation, nor does it consume energy as defined by NERC.  The QSE's responsible for the transactions need to be identified on the NERC Tags.  Therefore, beginning with schedules submitted for September 4, 2001, ERCOT will no longer approve NERC Tags that list ERCOT as the Source Generator or Load or Sink Entity.  Please ensure that all personnel responsible for submitting NERC Tags are aware of this.

"Crisis Management","From Enron Corp Business Controls


Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12.  All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804.  In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately.

With respect to employees stranded around the United States, we regret that these employees should make their way back to Houston or their home office as best they can via commercial airlines, train, or rental car.  Unfortunately, corporate and other private aircraft will not be flying until sometime after restrictions are lifted on commercial carriers.  Therefore, Enron corporate aircraft should not be counted on to provide assistance in this situation.

"Outlook Communication","Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our email environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that we have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues. 
?	During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exchange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug, which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the better part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which appears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchange servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?	Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experienced database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Outlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchange servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected server.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use -- we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems with the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the business week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to move users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impacted users could not access their e-mail.
?	During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and dangerous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against viruses that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktops.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day.  The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but we believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron computing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this time, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as the performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the last few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

"SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

"Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan","


A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

"ENA Gas Structuring","
In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

"RE: November and December Vacation","hey Juan,
I realize I stuck my days in to the calendar like you asked before asking specifics this stuff and as it is right now I don't work either holidays.  If you'd like to change the dates I put in for Thanksgiving and have me work it, that is fine, I don't have strong feelings about it.. However, for Christmas, (including Christmas eve) I would very much like to have that off.

Subject: November and December Vacation


Hey guys and girls with the Holiday's fast approaching I am looking for a good few men and women to work the holidays.  These volunteers can work the Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas and New Years day.  You can work all of these days or just some of them.  Keep in mind that holiday pay is involved.  Let me know your preferences when you e-mail me your response.  If I get more volunteers than we need, then we will draw straws on who gets to work what holidays.  Also please e-mail your vacation request if you have any for the November and December Schedule.  The sooner I get everyones response the faster I can get the schedules out for November and December.  I almost forgot, in your e-mail let me know much you would like to work the holidays: very much, don't care one way or another, or don't want to work them at all.    That is all!!!

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

"FW: New E-Tag Feature:  Potential Adjust List","I am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the E-Tag system: the Potential Adjust List (PAL).

As you may or may not know, there is currently an ""Adjust List"" that is issued when TLRs are called. An ""Adjust List"" is a recommendation from the IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve needed relief to eliminate a constraint.  This Adjust List sent out to Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that are being recommended for curtailment.  It is intended to aid in coordination Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend specific curtailments.  As such, this recommendation can occur very late, leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or resink their power).  

The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the confirmation of all the impacting SCs.  This should allow this recommendation to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks.  When all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out as it is today.

It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are only recommendations for curtailment.  Control Areas may elect to curtail different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to local relief procedures or other business practices.  However, both lists should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and curtailments.  Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final curtailments will be very close.

This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris (Exelon Power Team).   If you talk to any of them during the course of daily business, please thank them for their support of this effort.  With their assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and cultivating NERC support in the various forums,  we were able to implement this change very quickly. 

I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28.  Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how it works.  If you would like more detail, please let me know.  I currently Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am intimately familiar with tagging and its functions.

In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our E-Tagging tools.  As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any questions.

"EFCU E-Survey Response","
Enron Federal Credit Union
E-Survey Response

We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.

We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:

				2001	2000
	Friendliness		88%	84%
	Courtesy		89%	84%
	Knowledge/Training	86%	80%
	Range of Services	87%	82%
	Saving Interest Rates	66%	60%
	Loan Interest Rates	65%	58%
	Quality of Service	88%	84%
	Communications	84%	79%
	Web Portal		72%	N/A
	Service Wait Time	79%	68%


Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:

ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:

-  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions.
-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).	
-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.


Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.

Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible.


Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible.

We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:

-  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.
-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m.
-  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up.
-  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com.
-  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up.

Thank you again for your feedback.  We look forward to the opportunity to bring you more of the latest financial services as they become available in the market.

"Modification (REDIRECT) on a firm basis.","Date:	August 21, 2001

To:	Entergy Transmission Customers

Subject: 	Modification (REDIRECT) on a firm basis.


Effective 10:00 AM, Wednesday August 22, 2001, Entergy will begin accepting partial term REDIRECTS on a firm basis.  Entergy believes the guidelines listed below are necessary to manage the redirects on a firm basis, and successfully allow the recalled portion of the original reservation to become available for other customers to purchase. If you have any questions, please call David McNeill at 870-541-3931 or Cameron Warren at 870-543-5497.



Section 22.2 - Modification on a Firm Basis

a) As available, Entergy's transmission customers may modify the source/sink or POR/POD of confirmed firm point-to-point service on a firm basis at no additional cost per section 22.2 and Attachment 'M' of the OATT.

b) Requests to modify on a firm basis will be treated as a new request for firm service.

c) Requests to modify on a short-term firm basis must be submitted via OASIS using the REDIRECT function no later than 12:00 noon two days prior to the start of the redirected service. Requests to modify on a long-term firm basis (twelve months or longer) will be processed according to the current business practices for original long-term firm service.

d) Request to modify on a firm basis must be pre-confirmed.

e) The REDIRECT request must include the assignment number of the original request in the related reference field.

f) Requests to modify on a firm basis must specify the exact same capacity as the original request.

g) Requests to modify on a firm basis must not be for an interval of the original reservation in which a previously submitted schedule exists.

h) Requests to modify on a firm basis may be submitted in daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly service increments.

i) Requests to modify on a firm basis must be within the time interval of original reservation (the REDIRECT cannot start before the original start date or end after the original end date).

j) Upon acceptance of a REDIRECT request, the customer loses their rights to the redirected interval of the original request and Entergy will release the original reserved capacity back to the market. If the customer wishes to revert back to the original path they must submit another REDIRECT subject to the same guidelines as all other new REDIRECT requests.

k) When applicable, rollover rights will be given on the original reservation only.

"MISO Losses - News and an Important Question","Good news.  It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially.  Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.

Now, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).

If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.

Subject:  Daily NERC Security Conf. Call

Note:  ECARMETSC please distribute to member Control Areas.

Brief from today's (October 17) daily NERC Security Call:

SC's      -A New England Plant reported a Cessna airplane buzzed their
stack 4 times.
          -ERCOT reports a crew spotted suspicious individuals in a car
          outside a substation.  They appeared to have a map or prints and
          were pointing at the station. Their license plate number was
          turned over to authorities.

NIPC      - Yesterday evening, a non-verifiable but site specific bomb
          threat was received by the NIPC against an Eastern PJM Power
          Plant.  The information was passed on to the Plant, PJM, and law
          enforcement officials.

DOE       - Continue at SECON level 3 modified.  Note:  SECON-3 is used
          when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist
          activity exists and may increase access controls to include
          additional personnel and vehicle barriers.

NERC           -Continue in Alert level 2.5, something between full alert
status and heightened alert.


ECAR/MET Security Coordinator suggests that ECAR members continue to
evaluate their security measures and take action that they deem appropriate
to protect the system and their investment.  ECAR/MET reminds the ECAR
members that if Federal Agencies discover that one of your facilities is
the target of a credible threat, that they will notify you directly of such
threat.  You are asked to notify the ECAR/MET Security Coordinator of any
and all suspicious activities that occur on or near critical transmission
facilities and power plants, as well as the appropriate law enforcement
authorities.


This information is for dissemination within the industry only.  Please do
not make available to any public posting.

TJae: Please forward this message to the group.

Hi All:

We have rolled out the following new features for the MetaStock applet:

1) Cash prices (Gas Daily and Megawatt Daily prices) are now available for the major power and gas hubs (in addition to the existing forward strips).
""Cash"" was added as a new term (see the ""Term"" dropdown box). You can apply any of the actions (price chart, spreads, or heat rates) to these cash values.

2) Flexible beginning or ending dates for the displayed chart. 

For more detailed information:
	-- Please refer to the help files (on the left of the MetaStock applet), 
	-- Contact Anna Santucci at x.34225 if you have any comments or additional requests for MetaStock,
	-- Contact Mark Symms at x. 33105 if you have any technical difficulties working with this application.

Thanks,
Anna
On behalf of Fundies/IT groups

P.S. Volatility charts are rolling out next!

"NERC Security Coordinator Terrorist Alerts","As a result of the Sept 11 attacks on the US, NERC Security Coordinators are being relied upon by the FBI and the DOE to report to them any threats or attacks on the US electric grid.   Security Coordinators have also discussed operating the grid under restricted access condtions during ""heightened awareness"".  There is no clear indication what the operators will do differently at times of heightened alerts.  However, it may be so extreme as shutting down interfaces and drastically reducing transfer capability.  Such actions may not be noticed on OASIS.  We are arguing that such actions should - to greatest extent possible - attempt to not disrupt markets.

Please report to me or Susan Lindberg, any suspicous denials or TLRs that you think may have been enacted as a result of such security actions.

For example, since the Afghanistan bombing raids this Sunday, NERC is operating under a state of ""heightened awareness"" this week.

Where: EB3127 for Nov. 1st from  9:00 am - 2:00 pm

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*



AGENDA:
9:00A  to 11:00A
Kevin Burns will be here from OATI to provide specifications and describe in more detail the functionality of Web Trader.  
11:30 to 2:00 PM 
Our goal is to have representatives from the 24-Hour Group and the IT Group bring specific questions for Kevin.   
Let's determine if WebTrader can be flexible enough to replace the P&L (Delphi) application, interact with Enpower, and provide a good detailed database for historical information.  Most importantly, is this application fast and efficient enough to add value to the 24-hour group.

Call me with any questions or to discuss.  853-0421

Thanks,

Corry

"Security Coordinator Conference Call 10-15-01","Brief from today's (October 15) daily NERC Security Call:

NERC           -Will reduce to  Alert level 2.5, something between full
alert status and heightened alert.
          - CIPWG continues to work on level definitions.  Still a week or
two away from completion.

NIPC      - Reports that threats are of general nature, still considered
high risk and of a lasting threat.
          - Most reports into NIPC are presently bio-threat related.

DOE       - Will reduce to Level 3 modified at noon today.  Note:  SECON-3
          is used when an increased and more predictable threat of
          terrorist activity exists and may increase access controls to
          include additional personnel and vehicle barriers.   DOE had been
          in a SECON-2  which is used when a terrorist incident occurs or
          intelligence information is received indicating that some form of
          terrorist action is imminent, and requires specific protection
          measures to be put in place.

SC's      -There continues to be reports of ""suspicious"" individuals and/or
          groups taking pictures of power plants.
          -As reported on the news last night, National Guard troops are be
          used at Nuclear facilities in NY State.


ECAR/MET Security Coordinator suggests that ECAR members continue to
evaluate their security measures and take action that they deem appropriate
to protect the system and their investment.  ECAR/MET reminds the ECAR
members that if Federal Agencies discover that one of your facilities is
the target of a credible threat, that they will notify you directly of such
threat.  You are asked to notify the ECAR/MET Security Coordinator of any
and all suspicious activities that occur on or near critical transmission
facilities and power plants, as well as the appropriate law enforcement
authorities.



This information is for dissemination within the industry.  Please do not
make available to any public posting.

Hey guys and girls with the Holiday's fast approaching I am looking for a good few men and women to work the holidays.  These volunteers can work the Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas and New Years day.  You can work all of these days or just some of them.  Keep in mind that holiday pay is involved.  Let me know your preferences when you e-mail me your response.  If I get more volunteers than we need, then we will draw straws on who gets to work what holidays.  Also please e-mail your vacation request if you have any for the November and December Schedule.  The sooner I get everyones response the faster I can get the schedules out for November and December.  I almost forgot, in your e-mail let me know much you would like to work the holidays: very much, don't care one way or another, or don't want to work them at all.    That is all!!!

The Commission ordered Entergy to revise the credit provision in the agreements (and in Entergy's pro forma IA in its OATT) to provide for crediting of all network upgrades.  This is consistent with a May 2001 FERC order that required Consumers Energy to credit customers for all network upgrade costs, including those incurred to remedy short-circuit or stability related problems.

"RTO Orders - Grid South, SE Trans, SPP and Entergy","The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we expected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The Commission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and its neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and configuration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a lack of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order states that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmission organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission indicates that they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the order requires the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will start next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope characteristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to focus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order states, ""We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.""  The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may be more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market development, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesale electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the mediation as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is starting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managment, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the order is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  Therefore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and file a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

Subject:	Job Opportunities in ENA

Dear Johnny Palmer, 

I heard about openings in the ENA power trading team, employing 12 hour shifts. If there are job opportunities for a person of my caliber, I hope we can meet.  After graduating from Rice University and finishing my graduate degree in University of Texas' business school, I worked for Enron for 2 years in EBS and Corporate.  For more background, please look at my resume and let me know if you are interested in having a brief interview with me.

 
Sincerely,

The acceptance is subject to refund depending on the outcome of settlement proceedings in which AEP and protestors have been asked to work out differences regarding ancillary service provisions.  Specifically, East Texas Cooperatives and Cooperative Customer Group - West complained that the OATT is an attempt to abrogate existing contracts they have with AEP.

"Are you up for the Challenge?","


Are you creative? Do you have a great imagination? Can you create something out of nothing? Are you fast on your feet?
If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then I have a challenge for you!
We are looking to create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  Oh, did I mention that your materials will consist only of Legos?  That's right - LEGOS. 
Here is the layout -
			Friday, August 10th
			11:00 a.m. 	Teams assemble to begin construction.
			11:45 a.m. 	Construction is complete.
			12:00 p.m. 	Ken Lay will host - The Applause Meter. The winning team will then be recognized by Mr. Lay and he will 					follow up with an e-mail to all Houston employees.
Here are the guidelines -																
			1.  Teams must consist of 7-10 members from your Business Unit.  I need to have at least 3 executives (Directors, Vice 				     	     Presidents, or Managing Directors) to this team.   
			2.  The model must be free-standing. 
			3.  Your choice of other materials may be used!
Be sure to encourage your co-workers to come and cheer you on!  Please give me a call or e-mail me if you are interested in participating.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit child care centers.
Thank you,
Julie Clyatt

Subject: November and December Vacation


Hey guys and girls with the Holiday's fast approaching I am looking for a good few men and women to work the holidays.  These volunteers can work the Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas and New Years day.  You can work all of these days or just some of them.  Keep in mind that holiday pay is involved.  Let me know your preferences when you e-mail me your response.  If I get more volunteers than we need, then we will draw straws on who gets to work what holidays.  Also please e-mail your vacation request if you have any for the November and December Schedule.  The sooner I get everyones response the faster I can get the schedules out for November and December.  I almost forgot, in your e-mail let me know much you would like to work the holidays: very much, don't care one way or another, or don't want to work them at all.    That is all!!!

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

"MHEB / Eservices Off-peak Alliance begins 7/16/2001","Hey,

Tonight will mark the first night of the MHEB / Eservices Off-peak Alliance.  The Eservices group just signed a contract (a copy of which will be provided to you) effectuating an commercial agreement, where Enron will attempt to market a mutually agreed upon quantity of off-peak power outside of MAPP (including KCPL & MPS) above a MHEB determined reference price.  In addition, if you see a bid in MAPP that is greater than the reference price, let MHEB know about it.  MHEB and Eservices will share the profit(50/50) from trades done.  Also, if there is a TLR, LLR curtailment MHEB will share half the cost of the transmission loss.

Nature of deal:
This is to be a friendly lead-in deal hopefully to be cultivated into longer term deal that will allow us access to some more lucrative products. 

Transacting:
Call MHEB during the night shift and their real-time desk will tell you how many MW are available, and what the reference price will be.  If you can sell the power for more that the reference price + transmission, inform the MHEB desk and get it done.  Be careful of TLRs and ATC restrictions.

MAPPF ATC Flowgate website on MAPP Oasis: 
Under the heading ""Flowgate ATC"", select ""Non-Firm ATC"" to check the atc for flowgates ""COOPER_S"", ""FTCAL_S"", and ""PRI-BYN"".  These are the flowgates that usually cause our MAPP-F requests to be declined.

You can also check the specific path (POR to POD) under the heading ""Contract Path ATC"".

http://toinfo.oasis.mapp.org/oac/oac2/script/atcs.html


Booking:
Deal should be entered in the Eservices P&L (just like the MDEA deal) and in enpower. Do not Enpower any deals until the Book is created.

Pricing Formula.
Energy Price (paid to MHEB) = .50 (SP - Cost - RP) + RP
SP= Sales Price
RP= Reference Price (MAPP Price to beat)
Cost= All cost incurred Buy/Resale, transmission, etc.

Eservices Staff:
Kayne Coulter and JD Kinser will be the lead contacts for questions regarding this deal.  JD will be the lead in charge of MHEB during the day and will work with MHEB.  You can call either of these guys with questions as well me at any time with questions.

Kayne & I spoke with Glen Matthews today and he said that he thought that they would have some power available beginning HE 1.  Keep in contact with them through the early evening and durin the night.


We believe that this deal, in the future, will be very lucrative for Enron and MHEB.  Therefore, please use all diligence to make sure the deals are done correctly and maximize value for us both.

If there are any questions tonight, please, call/page Kayne Coulter or me.

Thanks,

Don

Forwards should be put under the name of Exelon Generation Company LLC.  Unfortunately, they kept their transmission and so I cannot inactivate the name.  Thanks.

"Travel Security Update","
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

by Leonard Pitts Jr. of the Miami Herald
We'll go forward from this moment


It's my job to have something to say.
They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles
the American soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears
sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only
words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this
suffering.

You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.

What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our
World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would
learn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed.

Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. Did
you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. Did you want to
tear us apart? You just brought us together.


Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a
family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a
family nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending
tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae-a singer's
revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're
wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material
goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain
sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent,
though-peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right
thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people
of faith, believers in a just and loving God. Some people-you,
perhaps-think that any or all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We
are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by
arsenals.

IN PAIN
Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're
still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still
working to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect
from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom
Clancy novel. Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the
probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the
worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United States and,
probably, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never
been bloodied before. But there's a gulf of difference between making us
bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its
bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time
anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are
righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this
level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any
length, in the pursuit of justice.

I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you,
I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble
with dread of the future. In the days to come, there will be
recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose
failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from
happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of
revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered,
chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.

THE STEEL IN US
You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of
our character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On
this day, the family's bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will
weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in
defense of all that we cherish. So I ask again: What was it you hoped
to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the
depths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider the message
received. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my people.
You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know what you just
started.

But you're about to learn.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Just a reminder that the block of rooms at the Ameristar Casino / Hotel at

888-833-7700. There are only a few spots open for the golf and there is a
limit of 144 paid players, so if you know of anyone that plans to attend ask
them to contact me 303-308-6148 or Mike Martin 806-378-2376. We need someone
to volunteer to host the golf tournament next year so that we can keep this

Mike know.

We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.  For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.

"Tragedy Claims Life of Enron Employee","As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

"TEESSIDE POWER STATION INCIDENT UPDATE","
Earlier this evening, the police were able to confirm to Enron that all of our employees who tragically died or were injured as a result of yesterday's explosion have now been identified.  This means we are now in a position to give you some information about the members of staff:


Graeme White
Graeme, 37, is in a stable condition at Middlesbrough General Hospital.  He has worked as an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station since October 1999.  Graeme lives in Billingham and is separated with two children.

Paul Surtees 
Paul was Engineering & Maintenance Manager at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in 1992.   He was divorced with a young daughter and lived in Hawthorn, County Durham.  Paul died in Middlesbrough General Hospital earlier today.  He was 40.

Andrew Sherwood
Andrew was an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in March 1999.  He lived with his partner in Hartlepool.  Andrew died at the scene yesterday. He was 36.

Darren Higgins
Darren was also an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in October 1997.  He was unmarried and lived in Normanby near Middlesbrough.  Darren died at the scene yesterday.  He was 28 and leaves a young son living in Poland.


We are continuing to offer as much support as possible to the families of these employees, as well as their friends and colleagues at the plant and associated sites across Enron.

We understand that the last twenty-four hours have been extremely traumatic for everyone concerned. We appreciate there are many questions that remain unanswered, but for the moment our thoughts and prayers are with those we have lost and their families and friends.

We will communicate more information about the incident as it becomes available.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

"Security Coordinator Conference Call 10-19-01","Brief from today's (October 19) daily NERC Security Call:

SC's      -No new information

NIPC      - Cyber Notes: There's a new hacking tool out to exploit a bug,
          it's called Secure Shell. System operators have gotten remote
          scans attempting to run shells. There is rumor of a new Microsoft
          worm set to run November 11 called ""Redesi Worm""

DOE       - Continue at SECON level 3 modified.  Note:  SECON-3 is used
          when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist
          activity exists and may increase access controls to include
          additional personnel and vehicle barriers.

NERC           -Continue in Alert level 2.5, something between full alert
status and heightened alert.


ECAR/MET Security Coordinator suggests that ECAR members continue to
evaluate their security measures and take action that they deem appropriate
to protect the system and their investment.  ECAR/MET reminds the ECAR
members that if Federal Agencies discover that one of your facilities is
the target of a credible threat, that they will notify you directly of such
threat.  You are asked to notify the ECAR/MET Security Coordinator of any
and all suspicious activities that occur on or near critical transmission
facilities and power plants, as well as the appropriate law enforcement
authorities.


This information is for dissemination within the industry only.  Please do
not make available to any public posting.

"Traffic Report outage and new product enhancements","
To Our Valued  Traffic Report Clients,
 
Today, FriedWire's  Traffic Report experienced a disruption in service as a result of network and  general connectivity problems caused by third parties.  We apologize for  this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this  does not happen again.  As always, we remain committed to providing you  power markets information around-the-clock. 
Product Update 
FriedWire has just added significant new content and  capability to the Traffic Report, which areoutlined below.  Please contact us for  brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. 
NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather  Forecasts 
    3-7 day Maximum Temperatures  
    6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability  
    8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly  
    Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed  above) 
    Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies 
***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification  services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't  have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. 
Available Transmission Capacity  
FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for  available transmission by path.  The new geographic interface will allow  you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate  to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from  non-path providers and more. 
***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification  services are now available along with the new ATC interface.  Now, you can  be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that  you track ongoingly.  You can custom define your alerts according to the  provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're  interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the  week, time of day, times per day, etc.). 
The following additional product upgrades have been  deployed: 
All hourly offerings are now reflected in military  time designations. 
Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range  (i.e.; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. 
Eight new flowgates have been added for  Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy.  They all have  Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting ""View All Interties"".   All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of  weeks. 
 You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and  text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic  Report.  Simply click on the link that says ""My Account"" at the top  right-hand corner of any Traffic Report screen and look for the link just to  the right of the E-mail * input field that says Enter additional  e-mails.  Go to the Add an E-mail Contact link at the bottom of the next  screen. 

We hope you enjoy and find useful the new version of  the Traffic Report.  Please stay tuned for more exciting additions in the  near future. 
Sincerely, 
Bill Townsend 
President 
FriedWire Inc.

Subject:	A Tribute to the United States


I never send these out so it must be pretty good...
This is from a Canadian newspaper.

AMERICA : THE GOOD NEIGHBOR
Widespread, but only partial news coverage was given recently
to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon
Sinclair, a Canadian television commentator.

What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed
in the Congressional record:

""This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans
as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people
on all the Earth.  Germany, Japan, and to a lesser extent, Britain and
Italy were lifted out of the debris of War by the Americans who pour-
ed in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts.  None of
these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining
debts to the United States.

When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans
who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled
on the streets of Paris.  I was there.  I saw it.

When the earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that
hurries
in to help.  This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by
tornadoes.  Nobody helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into
discouraged countries.  Now newspapers in those countries are writing
about the decadent, warmongering Americans.  I'd like to see just one of
those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States
dollar
build its own airplane.

Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing
Jumbo
Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC-10?  If so, why don't they
fly
them?  Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American
Planes?
Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on
the moon?  You talk about the Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
You
talk about the German technocracy, and you get automobiles.

You talk about the American technocracy, and you find men on the moon.
Not
once, but several times and safely home again.  You talk about scandals,
and
the Americans put theirs in the store window for everybody to look at.

Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded.  They are here on
our
streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are
getting
American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend here.

When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down
through
age, it was Americans who rebuilt them.  When the Pennsylvania and the
New
York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose.  Both are
still
broke.

I can name you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help other
people
in trouble.  Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to
the
Americans in trouble?  I don't think there was outside help even during
the
San
Francisco earthquake.

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I am one Canadian who is damned
tired
of
hearing them get kicked around.  They will come out of this thing with
their
flag
high.  And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the
lands
that
are gloating over their present troubles.

I hope Canada is not one of those.""
Stand Proud America!

For those who are active in the energy business, remember those with whom we
work that have passed.

"Announcing Outlook Web Access for Houston Outlook Users","Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

Resolution Center at x31411 or

***

Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy), acting as agent for Entergy Arkansas, Inc., submits a revised and redesignated interconnection and operating agreement between Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Wrightsville Power Facility, LLC (Wrightsville). Entergy states that this is intended to supersede Entergy Operating Companies Original Service Agreement No. 216 under FERC Electric Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 3. Entergy further states that the revision reflects Wrightsville's revision of its selection of Optional System Upgrades for its facility and corrects the tax gross-up factor noted in the cost estimates in the appendices of the Wrightsville interconnection agreement. Entergy requests an effective date of September 25, 2000, the date on which the original interconnection agreement was deemed by FERC.  (ER01-2300-000)

"plasma displays","Juan,

here are my costs on two flat plasma displays. i might be able to sell them
to you at cost. i'll double check.


Panasonic TH-42PWD4UY $4700.00

Sony PFM42B/1  $5519.00

The key is the desktop receiver which will accept the HDTV signal and send
it to your display.  You can hook up regular cable to it or a DVD player and
get an incredible look. From what I heard DTV is the only one offering a
HDTV signal.  Go down to Circuit City and see what they are going for. Write
down model#'s and I'll see if I can sell them.  You can also hook up your
computer to this two plasma displays for one incredible monitor.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"MDEA May 4 HE5 4 Mwhs","Guys,

Rebecca Grace received a call from Axia and they are NOT agreeing that they sold us 4 Mwhs for HE5 on May 4.  The MDEA 0504.xls model (maintained at the time by GENCO) indicates that we made a 4 Mwh purchase from Axia for MDEA.  Rebecca has checked OATI for any/all tags for this day and has accounted for everything but that transaction.  

I was hoping we could find out who was working that morning and perhaps they could check their records / log book to see if the transaction occured and verify it was, in fact, AXIA.

Please let me know and copy Rebecca Grace what we can do to resolve this issue.

"New Dialing Instructions","
To:          All Enron Houston Users
 
Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)
?         Press the # key

    Everyone,
   There has been a major shakeup at TRW.  I  have always  worked for TRW
   Automotive Electronics.   Well, we just got told that we TRW  AE has been
   dissolved  and no longer exists.  I support the Safety  & Security,  along
   with some Body Control plants.  Well, now I am   supposed to be going to
   the division known as Occupant Safety  Systems (Airbags  & Seatbelts).  I
   am not sure  what is going to  happen........

"BP/WRI cut from June 2001","Hey Juan,

BP has brought this cut back again claiming that you agreed to keep their purchase whole, however WRI does not agree to booking out.  Per Karen at BP you agreed to a $66 bookout price for HE 7 & 8 from 6/14/01 tag 91234 source/sink EES.  I have a copy of the tag at my desk in case you don't want to go digging through the tag archives.  Please look into this as soon as you can, this has been going on way too long and I have exhausted my resources in solving the issue.

Thanks,
Michael

"Hey there!","Juan,

How are you?  I ran into Jaime Bustos last week and your name came up.
How's the family?  Any more kids?  We're doing well in Louisville.  You may
already know this, but Sterling and I started a company a few years ago that
provides information to the energy markets on plant output.  Pretty
interesting stuff.

Anyway, give me a call when you get a minute.  I understand that you're on
the 24-hour desk and I would like to get your feedback on a few things
related to our business.

I can be reached at (502) 645-5252.

Sean O'Leary

"New from FriedWire...","
Good morning to all of you at Enron.
 
I wanted to make you all aware of two major new capabilities that FriedWire is soon to deploy.  One will be the new PJM intelligence module that will be an add-on to the existing Traffic Report.  The other is a brand new version of the Traffic Report itself that incorporates real-time electricity prices and news/commentary from THE major provider of this content.  FriedWire will be making some announcements shortly describing the strategic alliance between our firm and this content partner, and should be able to start showing the enhanced, jointly developed version of the Traffic Report in October.
 
Regarding the PJM module; we are now scheduling 30-40 minute, remote (Internet-based) overviews with clients who actively trade in PJM.  These will begin the week of September 24th.  If any of you or your colleagues would like to participate in a very informal session that looks at the capabilities of this new tool, please contact me and I can help set-up a date and time.  Some of the content and functionality in the PJM module includes:
 
}         Real time price and loadcharts that present current conditions in historical context
}         Real-time and day-ahead LMP data along with the public FTR data to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}         Easy interface for querying FTR data to provide competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}         Tools for valuing FTRs in the monthly FTR auction
}         PJM load charts displaying PJM ISO load forecast bias
}         Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}         LMP charts and maps
}         Customizable displays in the form of personalized Watchlists, tables and chart building tools
 
Thanks and contact me with anything you might need.
 
Take Care, 
 
Stuart Wright
Director
FriedWire Inc.

Thanks for your reply.
Here's what I have learned from our conversation:
Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were ""captured"" by Don and Juan's group?
I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.

Don and Juan have invited my employee,  Steve Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.

I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?

Well...the trip has been booked....at one time you had a few spots.  The only room we have now if for one. We used your spots because we never got your response so we filled them with customers.

Please let me know ASAP if Steve Olinde will be in that spot so that I can get his airfare booked and notify the hotel.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
EGM's global crude and products group closed its largest trades to date with EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EOT) on June 29,2001.  Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. (""EGLI"") is the counterparty to a 10-year toll conversion agreement and a 10-year storage capacity agreement that also provides transportation.  The toll conversion agreement calls for EGLI to deliver a combination of feedstocks (methanol, natural gas, and normal butane) to be converted into various offtake products, primarily MTBE. 

As a part of the 10-year conversion agreement, EGLI has the option to convert the facility into an Iso Octane plant.  The option to convert is EGLI's sole and exclusive right.  In addition, the call helps to mitigate the regulatory risk associated with the MTBE market.

Prior to the close of the 10-year conversion and storage capacity agreements, Enron's corporate development group organized the sale of the hydrocarbon-processing complex in Morgan's Point, Texas, and a liquids pipeline grid system to EOTT for approximately $120 million.  The asset sale was predicated on the agreements to be entered into between EGLI and EOTT.  

These combined agreements represent EGM's largest transaction to date.

EGM Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals welcomes Andrew Hill to the Houston office for a six-month assignment from London.  Andrew joined EGM in March as a Senior Specialist and has been instrumental in developing the growing range of EGM Fundamentals publications such as Critical Mass and The Week Ahead.  In Houston, Andrew will be working with Richard Lassander to manage analysis of the crude and products markets.  Prior to joining EGM, Andrew worked as a management consultant specializing in Latin America with Wood McKenzie.

EGM Fundamentals has begun analysis of domestic freight markets.  This new effort, managed by Jeff Andrews, is being coordinated with Matt Arnold's forward trading group in Enron Freight Markets (EFM).  Current analysis is focused on over-the-road trucking, following the initial commercial focus of EFM, and the development of diesel hedging strategies.  Related projects include modeling the seasonality of trucking demand and diesel fuel consumption and forecasting on-road diesel prices.  Within the next three to four weeks, analysis will begin of the intermodal freight network.  Interested parties should watch the EGM Fundamentals intranet site (<http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com>) for updates.

East Power Origination
The Sand Hill Energy Center in Austin was dedicated on Wednesday, July 11th at 10:00 am.  The $93.7 million project is the first peaking facility of its kind in Texas to be constructed with selective catalytic reduction pollution control equipment that reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission rate by 80 percent.  NOx emissions from the units are 5 parts per million (ppm), which is considerably less than the amounts allowed by state and federal regulations.  Congratulations to the development team!

IN THE NEWS

""For California to continue this bogus claim of $8.9 billion, I think just shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. ""They are just interested in creating a whipping post. The last thing that the political leadership in California wants to do is take responsibility for the problem they created.""

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany 
Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first physical supply contract with an industrial customer.  The customer, based in Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be taking gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base load.

In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team completed a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbent player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside Germany in order to close the gas supply deal.  ""Although we are happy that we have successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contractual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four network operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the negotiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transport from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France,"" commented Carsten Haack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke and Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important element of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first transportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after Ruhrgas. ""This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, especially in East Germany, "" said Haack. ""But more importantly, this deal will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to customers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!"" he added.

ETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont
Congratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL) for signing a series of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wilton International.

A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two million tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plants. New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies, and for the provision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance, security and emergency response.

Paul Gavens, CEO of ETOL, said: ""Securing an exclusive long-term supply agreement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achievement for ETOL. The new arrangements extend the terms of our current contract for steam and power to 2010, restructure the pricing arrangements and offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the operation of their respective assets.""


Enron's Northernmost Partner!
Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Varanger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partnership will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperature risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian market generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.

This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationships in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varanger has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in cooperation with Russian partners to manage the water storage.

Subject:	New from FriedWire...


Good morning to all of you at Enron.
 
I wanted to make you all aware of two major new capabilities that FriedWire is soon to deploy.  One will be the new PJM intelligence module that will be an add-on to the existing Traffic Report.  The other is a brand new version of the Traffic Report itself that incorporates real-time electricity prices and news/commentary from THE major provider of this content.  FriedWire will be making some announcements shortly describing the strategic alliance between our firm and this content partner, and should be able to start showing the enhanced, jointly developed version of the Traffic Report in October.
 
Regarding the PJM module; we are now scheduling 30-40 minute, remote (Internet-based) overviews with clients who actively trade in PJM.  These will begin the week of September 24th.  If any of you or your colleagues would like to participate in a very informal session that looks at the capabilities of this new tool, please contact me and I can help set-up a date and time.  Some of the content and functionality in the PJM module includes:
 
}         Real time price and loadcharts that present current conditions in historical context
}         Real-time and day-ahead LMP data along with the public FTR data to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}         Easy interface for querying FTR data to provide competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}         Tools for valuing FTRs in the monthly FTR auction
}         PJM load charts displaying PJM ISO load forecast bias
}         Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}         LMP charts and maps
}         Customizable displays in the form of personalized Watchlists, tables and chart building tools
 
Thanks and contact me with anything you might need.
 
Take Care, 
 
Stuart Wright
Director
FriedWire Inc.

"RE: Flood Workers","Guys John has come up with a great idea below that I will act on for you all.

However I need a rough estimate of who was in over the week end and the extra hours they put in ect. If you could give me a rough estimate of business that was done during the week end will also help our story.

I will get the forms from Kim and have her review as she is on the committee that review these personnel best requests, so she no's what to put in that will really work.

Thanks.

Hey Lloyd,
As you know,  Joe and Steve spent a considerable amount of time here last weekend due to the flood.     I would think that some recognition would be in order.

How about a personal best of $500,  or a gift certificate,  etc.?     

What do you think?

"Your Role in Computer Virus Protection","As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.

"Our Previous Discussion","Juan / Don:

Per our conversation on August 9, my manager, Jeff Sorenson, returned from London on Monday (8/27).  Today, Jeff and I discussed our conversation and my desire to pursue opportunities within your trading group.  Jeff's position on my pursuit of other opportunities was positive.  Jeff stated that he did not want to prevent me from pursuing my interests within Enron.  If I completed the interview process and was given the opportunity to join your group, Jeff expressed a concern over the desired time period for a transition and finding additional staff to fill my current responsibilities.  This is not an area that we discussed in detail, thus I informed Jeff that I would provide him with some additional details.  If the opportunities are still available, I definitely want to pursue them further.  I'll will contact you on Wednesday to discuss any further details.  If there is a particular time that is more convenient to talk, please let me know.  Thanks again, and I looking forward to meeting with you again.

Subject:	Traffic Report outage and new product enhancements


To Our Valued  Traffic Report Clients,
 
Today, FriedWire's  Traffic Report experienced a disruption in service as a result of network and  general connectivity problems caused by third parties.  We apologize for  this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this  does not happen again.  As always, we remain committed to providing you  power markets information around-the-clock. 
Product Update 
FriedWire has just added significant new content and  capability to the Traffic Report, which areoutlined below.  Please contact us for  brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. 
NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather  Forecasts 
    3-7 day Maximum Temperatures  
    6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability  
    8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly  
    Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed  above) 
    Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies 
***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification  services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't  have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. 
Available Transmission Capacity  
FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for  available transmission by path.  The new geographic interface will allow  you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate  to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from  non-path providers and more. 
***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification  services are now available along with the new ATC interface.  Now, you can  be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that  you track ongoingly.  You can custom define your alerts according to the  provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're  interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the  week, time of day, times per day, etc.). 
The following additional product upgrades have been  deployed: 
All hourly offerings are now reflected in military  time designations. 
Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range  (i.e.; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. 
Eight new flowgates have been added for  Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy.  They all have  Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting ""View All Interties"".   All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of  weeks. 
 You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and  text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic  Report.  Simply click on the link that says ""My Account"" at the top  right-hand corner of any Traffic Report screen and look for the link just to  the right of the E-mail * input field that says Enter additional  e-mails.  Go to the Add an E-mail Contact link at the bottom of the next  screen. 

We hope you enjoy and find useful the new version of  the Traffic Report.  Please stay tuned for more exciting additions in the  near future. 
Sincerely, 
Bill Townsend 
President 
FriedWire Inc.

Don,

Attached is a detailed list of procedures and ideas on MHEB to send to the hourly crew.  With the end of August, lots of power, especially on-peak, is now available that was previously under contract for the summer.  We should have more opportunities to move this power.  They can call me with any questions.  Thanks.

"Judge's Final SE RTO Mediation Report + CN summary","The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast Power Grid platform that resulted from the mediation. 
 
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Model (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remaining unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  However, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its determination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should encourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by the parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FERC orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a model and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that parties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject her recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-type discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our suggested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholder participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  While she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not adopt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day 2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).
 
The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the Grid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (without any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed changes to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest 
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, regardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC 
Her opinion is that the ""Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility sponsored) Model"" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion management) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No. 2000 based on a ""best practices"" analysis of other RTOs and Commission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, etal.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model is not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsibilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below: 
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was added to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission owner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would administer the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and transmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She strongly encourages this split. 
Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets 
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), with RTO oversight 
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pursuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be subject to further discussion) 
RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including rate changes and tariff filings 
All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their rights should they win on appeal) 
4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and GridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant transmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existing facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those above).  There will be one ""through and out rate"", plus a Grid Management Charge for RTO operation. 
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT 
Financial Rights/LMP (includes ""real time spot market"") is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many details need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH).  Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation, auction and non-discriminatory release.  The Grid model includes a ""balancing resource"" requirement that we will provide comments against 
Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market establishment 
RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC 
RTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process 
Numerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functions (all of our comments from last week's response are included) 
Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many are still concerned that FERC had not conducted a ""cost-benefit"" analysis and had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the ""economies of scale"" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure.  In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shifting:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allowed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into retail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant ""jump start"" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Judge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the initial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a ""best practices"" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with LMP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent board structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process.  The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a minimum, consider similar mediated ""jump starts.""

"Unclassified rules","These are  the rules, no exceptions especially 15. 
  
  
1. Any Man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally  
killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.  
  
2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.  
  
3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:  
a. When a heroic dog dies to save its master  
b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse  
c. After wrecking your boss' Ferrari  
d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into The Crying Game  
e. When your Date is using her teeth  
  
4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a  
friend out of jail within 12 hours.  
  
5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move  
a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident  
  
6. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move:  
a. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns  
  
7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is  off  
limits forever, unless you actually marry her.  
  
8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's  running  
late is 5 minutes. Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes. For a girl,  you have  
to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the  classic  
1-10 scale.  
  
9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is  
forbidden. Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.  
  
10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for  another  
man. (In fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly  
optional.)  
  
11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops,  not the  
weakest.  
  
12. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies'  girlfriends  
within 30 minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make  nice  
with her gal pals' significant dick-heads--- low level sports  
bonding is all the law requires (sorry ladies, it's called a  double  
standard because it's twice as true).  
  
13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do  not  
appear in public wearing more than one swoosh.  
  
14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you  may  
always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never  ask  
who's playing.  
  
15. You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have  brought  
her to climax. If you trap her head under the covers for the  purpose of  
flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.  
  
16. Only in situations of Moral and/or Ass peril are you allowed  to  
kick another guy in the nuts.  
  
18. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.  
  
19. Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.  
  
20. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem---you didn't  see  
nothin'.  
  
21. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated  as  
spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the  ability to  
pick a buffalo wing clean (chicken wing).  
  
22. You must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the  death of a  
girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire  
and threw it into a ceiling fan.  
  
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman  must  
remain sober enough to fight.  
  
24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice  of  
pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.  
  
25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be  talking  
about his choice of beer.  
  
26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a buddy of  yours,  
except if she's withholding sex pending your response.  
  
27. Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while lifting  
weights:  
a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!  
b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!  
c. Another set and we can hit the showers!  
d. Nice Ass, Are you a Sagittarius?  
  
28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal  footing:  
both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other  situations, an  
almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.  
  
29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than  you  
are able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone;  Hang  
up if necessary.  
  
30. When a buddy is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him  only in  
a manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.  
  
31. You cannot rat out a coworker who shows up at work with a  massive  
hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with  
limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he  
thinks his monitor is broken, and have him paged over the  
loudspeaker every seven minutes.  
  
32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a  friend""  
have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling  weird and  
guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion  about  
what a big mistake it was.  
  
33. Always split aces and eights. No arguments.

Subject:	FERC Order Firm Redirection


Attached is a FERC Order issued today in Docket EL01-104-000.  The decision
concludes that, when ATC would permit, Transmission Providers must allow
firm redirection of long-term, point-to-point transmission service for
periods less than the remainder of the contract.  SPP's practice has been to
require that any redirection of transmission service on a firm basis should
be for the remaining balance of the term of service.  Effective immediately,
SPP is implementing the FERC Order for redirection of long-term,
point-to-point transmission service .  SPP's business practices will be
revised and posted on SPP's OASIS.  If you have any questions, please call
myself or Lanny Nickell.
