"RAC happy Hour and Boss Day","Rick,

This email was supposed to be delivered the week after the Happy Hour. Something went wrong and it never got delivered. I still want you and Karen to read it. 

Rick,

Thank you for inviting us to the Happy Hour last week. As always these events help us to break the silos in which we tend to work some 
times. In this occasion I made two new friends and had the opportunity to discuss business maters with the people that work in Rick Carson group. After finishing the 3-Quarter revaluation process, I feel that Underwriting and Due Diligence can work much more closer, shearing information and experiences from the Due diligence site visits.  

Happy boss day

"Enron Japan is at the entrance of ""Bermuda Triangle""!!!","Dear Enron's topmanagement,
We are not only concerned on the crashed stock but also Enron's
situation in Japan. The business here is too difficult!!!
How do you know the current situation here:

  > Bad Reputation in Japan - if you say you are from Enron people will say 
""No""
  > Ignorance of Japanese Business - wasting many time on TOCOM, a market
    controlled by mafia, those minor comnies want to cheat Enron's money
  > Unsatisfactory business environment - deregulation will not proceed in 
three
    years
  > Poor manegment - the office is like a kindergarden, the so called 
""experts""
    have serious discrimmination with local staff; They do nothing 
themselves just
    ask the local ""slave"" to work hard and they go to vacation or business 
trip
  > ""Sato"" means sweet in Japanese but Sato Project is not so sweet as you 
think!
    Have you expected another ""E-power""?

I have to say we are so dispointed with Enron!!!! Enron Japan is at the 
entrance
of ""Bermuda Triangle"", we worry when will it dispear?

Sato

To those of us who have children in our lives, 
whether they are our own, grandchildren, nieces and nephews,
or students ... here is something to  make you chuckle. 

Whenever your children are out of control, you can take 
comfort from the thought that even God's omnipotence did not 
extend to His own children. After creating heaven and earth, 
God created Adam and Eve. 
And the first  thing he said was, ""Don't."" 
""Don't what ?"" Adam replied. 
""Don't eat the forbidden fruit."" God said. 
""Forbidden fruit? We have forbidden fruit? 
Hey, Eve ... we have forbidden fruit !"" 
""No way !"" 
""Yes, way !"" 
""Do NOT eat the fruit !"" said God. 
""Why ?"" 
""Because I am your Father and I said so !"" God replied, (wondering why 
he hadn't stopped creation after making the elephants). 
A few minutes later, God saw His children having an apple break and was 
He ticked! 
""Didn't I tell you not to eat the fruit ?"" 
God, as our first parent, asked. 
""Uh huh,"" Adam replied. 
""Then why did you?"" said the Father. 
""I don't know,"" said Eve. 
""She started it !"" Adam said, 
""Did not !"" 
""Did too !"" 
""DID NOT !"" 
Having had it with the two of them, God's punishment was that Adam and 
Eve should have children of their own. Thus, the pattern was set and it has 
never changed! 
But there is reassurance in this story. If you have persistently and 
lovingly tried to give children wisdom and they haven't taken it, don't 
be hard on yourself. If God had trouble raising children, what makes you 
think it would be a piece of cake for you? 

Advice for the day: 
If you have a lot of tension and you get a headache, do what it says on 
the aspirin bottle: ""Take two Aspirin"" and ""Keep away from children."" 

A FEW ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ! ... 
CHILDREN: You spend the first 2 years of their life teaching 
them to  walk and talk. Then you spend the next 16 telling 
them to sit down and  shut-up. 

-Grandchildren are God's reward for not killing your children. 
-Mothers of teens know why some animals eat their young. 
-Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually repeat word for word 
what you shouldn't have said. 
-The main purpose of holding children's parties is to remind yourself 
that there are children more awful than your own. 
-We child proofed our home 3 years ago and they're still getting in!

"[ASME-OMAE-Houston] REMINDER - ASME November 13th Dinner Meeting","     AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS  
     OFFSHORE MECHANICS AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING.

     OMAE ? Houston Chapter 

November 13, 2001 Dinner Meeting

Subject:	MEETING THE CHALLENGES OFDEEPWATER MOORING
Speaker:		Robert E. Ettle
		Vice President of Engineering - SEACOR Marine


Gulf of Mexico moored drilling units have moved from water depths of 
2,600 feet in the 1980's to over 6,000 feet by now.  This evolution 
has involved enhanced drilling units with combination wire-chain 
moorings, wires inserted into mooring legs, pre-laid mooring legs, 
and new, enhanced offshore support vessels.  Moored drilling in far 
greater water depths is expected.   SEACOR Marine's experiences in 
meeting these challenges in the Gulf of Mexico are described.  
Discussion will include engineering characteristics and operational 
capabilities of the latest generation of Anchor Handling Vessels.

MR. ETTLE served on five U.S. Coast Guard Cutters; of these he 
commanded three.   His Coast Guard shore assignments included search 
and rescue, oceanographic research, and port security.   Mr. Ettle 
worked for a succession of offshore drilling contractors, first as a 
Rig Mover and subsequently as a Manager of Marine Operations.  In the 
latter position, he was responsible for the worldwide mobilizations 
of drilling units for major offshore drilling contractors.  Since 
1997, he has been Vice President of Engineering for SEACOR Marine, an 
operator of over 300 offshore support vessels.  

MR. ETTLE holds a BS in Engineering from the U.S. Coast Guard 
Academy, a MS in Oceanography from the Naval Post-Graduate School, 
and an MBA from Kent  State University.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Learn to apply the revised Section Vlll, Division 1 with this computer based interactive training and earn 7 CEUs.

Product Site: http://www.asme.org/boilercode/computer1.html

Try the Demo: https://secure.asme.org/Section8survey/surveyform.cfm

With this personalized, self-paced, comprehensive training program, you master Section VIII, Division I, and learn to design vessels that conform to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. You also have the opportunity to earn 7 CEUs. You receive:
* CD-ROM with 40 interactive exercises that direct and assess your progress.
* Training Manual divided into eight modules to provide a structured, comprehensive program of study.

Using printed and electronic media developed by a former chairman of the Code Committee for Section VIII, Division 1, you enjoy a challenging, hands-on learning experience by solving practical design exercises and following the step-by-step logic of Code experts.

After loading the software, you begin with a pre-test, which evaluates your current understanding of the Code. The program generates a personalized study plan based on your pre-test score. By charting your pre-test results, the program identifies areas that you need to examine more thoroughly. 

Eight Learning Modules to Get You Up to Speed

You can also choose to be led through the exercises. Either way, you complete the exercises at your own pace. You can also leave the program and return to it later or start over at any time.

During the exercises you may refer to the training manual, which provides code excerpts and expert commentary. You may also access the training manual

"Thank You","Rick,

I just wanted to thank you for the Astros tickets last Wednesday.  We had a great time at the game even though the Astros couldn't pull out a win.  We appreciate being recognized and look forward to the next Board meeting since it will be here before we know it.

Thanks again,

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"FBI/DOJ Request for Organization Charts","
Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

		8.	Corporate Secretary/Board Communications - Paula Rieker

		9.	Enron Principal Investments - Kevin Garland

"Can you help me?","I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested
in the type of service we offer.

Some things to consider:

We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
interest as well.

Some memory joggers:

Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
Who do you know that likes nice cars?
Who do you know that owns their own company?
Who do you know that is successful in sales?
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

Thanks for your help!

Treo Talk 
***************************************************************************** 
Welcome to Treo Talk, a special section of the 
Handspring e-newsletter devoted entirely to keeping 
you informed about our brand new product, the 
Treo(TM) communicator. During the next few weeks, 
we'll bring you behind-the-scenes looks at its 
development, stories from the Treo design team, a 
sneak peak at some features and a whole lot more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The Road to Integration 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The concept isn't new. If you carry around a mobile 
phone and an organizer, you've probably wished 
someone would figure out how to combine them both 
into one small device. Now imagine if you also had 
to carry around a pager or a messaging device. Do 
this for a while and you'll understand the benefit 
of putting all three into one package. 

But successfully combining these devices involves 
much more than simply fitting them all into a single 
unit. Sure, you might get a good phone, but probably 
at the expense of a decent organizer. That's because 
the individual needs of these devices are in 
constant conflict with each other. A good mobile 
phone needs to be small, but organizers and web 
browsers need to have reasonably-sized screens to 
get the job done. And a numeric keypad is great for 
dialing numbers, but challenging for text entry. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
No Room for Compromise 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
These were some of the challenges the Treo design 
team faced when they started creating this product. 
The team wanted a device that looked and felt 
comfortable as a phone, but also worked perfectly 
as an organizer and wireless data device. 

""Other products that have existed in the past have 
been compromises,"" explains Jeff Hawkins, co-founder 
of Handspring and inventor of the PalmPilot(R). 
""You've had to trade off some of the main features 
to get the combined device. Our goal with Treo was 
to find a no-compromise solution.""


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Powerful Possibilities 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The team began to consider everything that was 
possible in a combined phone and organizer that 
could not be achieved with stand-alone devices. And 
what they found was often times surprisingly 
powerful. The result is a device that actually 
improves upon each of its individual components 
through a variety of unique features.

""The thing about Treo,"" Hawkins says, ""is that it's 
small enough to be a phone, and yet it's improved 
upon the phone and it's improved upon the organizer 
and it's added wireless data capabilities that no 
phone or organizer has ever had. And by combining 
them all together, you basically have a smaller 
product that does more than either one does 
separately."" 

In the weeks to come, we'll show you some of the 
unique features that resulted from this successful 
integration, along with the thinking that went into 
them. You'll get an in-depth look at what happens 
when you take a phone, an organizer and a 
messenger--add wireless Internet capabilities--and 
successfully combine them into one powerful device 
that does it all.

Why you'll never have to dial a phone number again.

Tips & Tricks 
***************************************************************************** 
You already know that To Do lets you keep track of 
those little tasks that call upon you each day. 
But did you also know that you can add even 
greater detail or organize them into different 
categories? If you didn't, you're about to find out 
how. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Adding Details to To Do's 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Once you've created a To Do item, you can still 
add more details if you need them. Tap anywhere 
on the original To Do and then tap Details at 
the bottom of the screen to bring up the To Do Item 
Details. From there you can enter its priority, 
category (see below) and due date. Then if you tap 
Note, you can enter more details, like driving 
directions and instructions. 

If you liked this tip, you can let us know by 
clicking below:
http://mojofarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/629-4408-2493-28?ck=tip&1


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Creating To Do Categories 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Always have a ton of tasks on your plate? Keep your 
To Do items organized in separate categories. To 
create a category, tap the right corner pull-down 
menu and select Edit Categories. Tap New and enter 
the name of the category (work, evening, groceries, 
etc.). Then when you create a new To Do item, tap 
Details and select the category of your choice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
My wife and I both have Visor handhelds. She has 
the basic and I have the Deluxe. We both have the 
eyemodule1 and the VisorPhone. 

My wife is an area manager for a large toy company. 
She is based in Wisconsin and her territory includes 
Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota. She uses the 
eyemodule1 to immediately capture visual examples 
of how stores in her territory should be set up and 
sends them (via the VisorPhone) to her headquarters 
in live time. For example, her bosses were planning 
a presentation and asked that she take a picture of 
a merchandiser and send it. The photo was taken in 
Illinois at about 10:30 a.m., and her corporate 
headquarters in Rhode Island had it by 11:00 a.m. 

When my wife had to be out of town on a business 
trip during our daughter's graduation from fifth 
grade, I was able to take pictures of our 
daughter's graduation and email them to my wife 
within twenty minutes of the ceremony. As you 
can see, with the addition of the modules we 
have purchased, our Visor handhelds have allowed 
us to better organize our busy lives.

<font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""2"">Welcome to Treo Talk, a special section of the 
Handspring e-newsletter devoted entirely to keeping you informed about our brand new product, <a href=""http://4at3.net/KC15271645.4131.0.4623"">the 
Treo&#8482; communicator</a>. During the next few weeks, we'll bring you behind-the-scenes looks at its 
development, stories from the Treo design team, a sneak peak at some features and a whole lot more.<p>
<font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""3""><b>The Road to Integration</b></font><br>
The concept isn't new. If you carry around a mobile phone and an organizer, you've probably wished 
someone would figure out how to combine them both into one small device. Now imagine if you also had 
to carry around a pager or a messaging device. Do this for a while and you'll understand the benefit 
of putting all three into one package.<br><br></font></td>
</tr></table></td></tr>
<tr><td><table><tr>
<td valign=""top"" width=""300""><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""2"">
But successfully combining these devices involves much more than simply fitting them all into a single 
unit. Sure, you might get a good phone, but probably at the expense of a decent organizer. That's 
because the individual needs of these devices are in constant conflict with each other. A good mobile 
phone needs to be small, but organizers and web browsers need to have reasonably-sized screens to get 
the job done. And a numeric keypad is great for dialing numbers, but challenging for text entry.<br><br></font></td>

<b>No Room for Compromise</b><br>
These were some of the challenges the Treo design team faced when they started creating this product. 
The team wanted a device that looked and felt comfortable as a phone, but also worked perfectly as an 
organizer and wireless data device.<p>
""Other products that have existed in the past have been compromises,"" explains Jeff Hawkins, co-founder 
of Handspring and inventor of the PalmPilot&#174;. ""You've had to trade off some of the main features to get 
the combined device. Our goal with Treo was to find a no-compromise solution.""<p>
<b>Powerful Possibilities</b><br>
The team began to consider everything that was possible in a combined phone and organizer that could 
not be achieved with stand-alone devices. And what they found was often times surprisingly powerful. 
The result is a device that actually improves upon each of its individual components through a variety 
of unique features.<p>
""The thing about Treo,"" Hawkins says, ""is that it's small enough to be a phone, and yet it's improved 
upon the phone and it's improved upon the organizer and it's added wireless data capabilities that no 
phone or organizer has ever had. And by combining them all together, you basically have a smaller 
product that does more than either one does separately.""<p>
In the weeks to come, we'll show you some of the unique features that resulted from this successful 
integration, along with the thinking that went into them. You'll get an in-depth look at what happens 
when you take a phone, an organizer and a messenger&#8212;add wireless Internet capabilities&#8212;and successfully 
combine them into one powerful device that does it all.<p>

<br><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif"" size=""3""><b>Adding Details to To Do's</b></font><br>
Once you've created a To Do item, you can still add more details if you need them. Tap anywhere on the original To Do and then tap Details at the bottom of the screen to bring up the To Do Item Details. From there you can enter its priority, category (see below) and due date. Then if you tap Note, you can enter more details, like driving directions and instructions.

Always have a ton of tasks on your plate? Keep your To Do items organized in separate categories. 
To create a category, tap the right corner pull-down menu and select Edit Categories. Tap New and

item, tap Details and select the category of your choice.<br>

1. Senate Confirms Two Senior Science and Technology Appointees
-- OSTP Director and Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology approved unanimously

2. Education Provisions Advance in Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bills
-- House and Senate versions differ on funding levels for math and science education initiatives

*****************************

SENATE CONFIRMS TWO SENIOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY APPOINTEES

On October 23rd, the Senate unanimously confirmed John H. Marburger III of New York to be Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Marburger managed Brookhaven, a facility in Upton, NY, that conducts basic and applied research for the Department of Energy. He was president of Stony Brook from 1980 until 1994. At his confirmation hearing last month before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, he stated that directing research to help combat terrorist attacks and emphasizing research on global climate change would top his list of priorities.  Marburger indicated that he would urge the Bush Administration to support research across many disciplines, especially in the chemistry, engineering and mathematics disciplines. ""Balance in this broad research portfolio recognizes that advances in one field, such as medicine, are often dependent on gains in other disciplines,"" he noted.  

The Senate also confirmed Phillip Bond of Virginia to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology. In that capacity, Bond will oversee technology policy, space commercialization and next-generation vehicles for the U.S. Department of Commerce. He will also supervise the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).  Bond had previously served as Director of Federal Public Policy Programs for Hewlett-Packard.

EDUCATION PROVISIONS ADVANCE IN LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILLS

House and Senate appropriators are moving forward on FY 2002 funding of key Department of Education math and science education improvement programs. However, their respective appropriations bills vary significantly on specific funding levels. Last year, funding for these programs was contained in the Eisenhower program's $485 million budget to fund teacher professional development, with $250 million set aside specifically for professional development in math and science. The current year's budget eliminates the Eisenhower program and consolidates teacher professional development into a broader category called ""Teacher Quality.""

Within the ""Teacher Quality"" category is a new initiative, the Math and Science Partnerships, which will provide competitive grants to partnerships of university departments, state education agencies, local school districts and others to improve math and science education through professional development and other activities. For FY 2002, the House appropriation would provide between $476 million and $635 million for the partnership initiative, compared with only $25 million in the Senate appropriation.  The difference will be settled by a House-Senate conference.

For additional information on K-12 science, math, engineering and technology education, contact Patti Burgio at 202.785.3756 or at burgiop@asme.org.

""QUADRENNNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW REPORT"" RELEASED

The ""Quadrennial Defense Review Report,"" issued every four years by the Department of Defense (DOD), is a planning document to guide changes in program direction.  A central objective of the most recent review as to shift the basis of defense planning from a threat-based model that has dominated thinking in the past to a capabilities-based model for the future. The report, compiled by senior civilian and military leaders within DOD, calls for a significant increase in funding for science and technology (S&T) programs to a level of three percent of DOD spending annually. By comparison, the Bush Administration's FY 2002 request for DOD is $343 billion. Of that amount, 2.7 percent would be allocated to S&T.

The report states, ""A robust research and development effort is imperative to achieving the Department's transformation objectives. DOD must maintain a strong S&T program that supports evolving military needs and ensures technological superiority over potential adversaries.""  DOD S&T activities consist of the 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 programs.

To view a copy of the report, go to http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/qdr2001.pdf For additional information on DOD S&T issues, contact Kathryn Holmes at 202.786.3756 or at holmesk@asme.org.

WHITAKER FOUNDATION TO PHASE OUT GRANT PROGRAM

The Whitaker Foundation, which has invested more than $575 million in biomedical engineering education and research, is continuing to phase out its grant programs to coincide with its planned closing in 2006. The goal of the foundation has been to accelerate the formation of a solid educational infrastructure at universities and a well-trained cadre of researchers and teachers by investing all of its resources over a relatively short period of time. In 1991, the foundation set a closing date of 2006 and accordingly raised its annual spending from $14 million in 1991 to between $60 million and $70 million annually from 2001 through 2005.

The foundation will continue to fund existing multiyear awards, but will no longer accept new applications for Leadership-Development Awards, i.e., large, long-term institutional awards. Four more competitions will be held for the Special Opportunity in Biomedical Engineering awards, three-year institutional awards to develop and enhance educational programs. Two more annual competitions will be held for the Graduate Fellowships in Biomedical Engineering, designed to help graduate students prepare for research careers in biomedical engineering.
For additional information on these and other grant programs, go to http://www.whitaker.org/news/phaseout.html

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR TRANSITIONS TO TEACHING PROGRAM

The Department of Education has announced 42 grants totaling $31 million to recruit mid-career professionals and recent college graduates for teaching careers. The grants, to be issued under the new Transitions to Teaching Program, will go to school districts, states or national organizations. Grantees must ensure that the recruits receive special assistance, guidance, support, and in some cases stipends and incentives, to make teaching a long-term career. Information on the funded projects is available at http://www.ed.gov/offices/OESE/

In a related matter, the Department of Education has also awarded $5 million to the National Council on Teacher Quality to launch the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence. See 
http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/10-2001/10052001e.html The Board will create a standard for teachers from non-traditional backgrounds to ensure that they will have credibility within the education system. The National Council on Teacher Quality is a nonprofit organizations affiliated with the Education Leaders Council and the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation.  For additional information, go to http://www.nctq.org/about.html

Thanks for letting me know about this.  I have copied Bob Hall, since he manages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critical issues, particularly at this time.  I will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires.  --Sally

Teresa,

Pursuant to a discussion you had with Debbie Brackett last month regarding manual wires not process through SAP impacts the return of collateral a great deal.   It is very important that these manual wires be processed immediately in order for us to receive the correct feeds from SAP and calculate the correct net exposures for each counterparty.

Today, Melissa Ratnala confirmed that we made a manual payment to Reliant Energy Services on October 10th in the amount of $57MM.  Unfortunately, we were not advised of the payment and it was not reflected in the SAP feeds.  This resulted in Reliant holding $57MM collateral for an additional 12 days.  The management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate information, in order to manage our daily cash position.  

Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made.  

How can we resolve this issue promptly?


Thanks,

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Treo Communicator Wins ""Best of Comdex"" Award
At Comdex Fall 2001 IT Trade Show

	
 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3277.233.34125625>	   <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	Handspring's Treo communicator earned the prestigious award for being the ""most innovative and influential"" IT product introduced during the show, in the mobile/handheld category.

Check out the highlights from Comdex <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3277.233.34125625>

Treo Talk
Last time, we talked about how the new Treo? communicator <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3278.233.34125625> lets you stay in touch when you just can't talk on the phone. This week we'll look at how it lets you surf the web-without wires.

	
Bandwidth on the Run
For most people the experience of ""surfing the web"" wirelessly has been more akin to wading in the shallow end of a pool. Even when you're able to access one of the select few websites that have been optimized for WAP (wireless application protocol), tiny mobile phone screens often mean endlessly scrolling through blocks of text one small line at a time. The Treo communicator changes all that.	
  <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
The Treo communicator comes loaded with Blazer? 2.0 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3279.233.34125625>, the latest version of Handspring's award-winning web browser for the Palm OS
. Blazer lets you securely view virtually any HTML, cHTML or WAP web site in its entirety-with full text and graphics formatted to look great on your Treo screen. So the content you see on your Treo communicator is the same as what you would find on your desktop computer. Plus, you can bookmark up to fifty sites, so the information you want the most is always at your fingertips.	   <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>

Take movie listings, news headlines,and shopping deals with you, on-the-go. <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>	 
  <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
Even if you've never accessed the web from a mobile device before, Treo makes it easy to see why you would want to. Imagine having instant access to a map when you get lost on the road. Or checking a stock quote during a power lunch. Or reading the top headlines on your way to work. Or buying movie tickets on the way to the theater. The Treo communicator lets you do all this and so much more-wherever you are.

The Word Is Out
Want to hear what others have to say about Treo? Here's a small sampling of some of the buzz <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3281.233.34125625> that this amazing product has generated so far.

Tips & Tricks
Cutting out just a few little steps now can save you heaps of time in the long run.

	
Customize Your Synchronization
You can shave time off your HotSync operation by only synchronizing the programs you actually use. Don't use the Expense application? Never read your email on the road? Don't waste precious synchronization time. Just open the Palm Desktop, choose the HotSync drop-down menu, and click Custom. You'll get a list of all the applications that synchronize. Simply change the ones you no longer need from Synchronize the files to Do Nothing and you're ready to start saving time!

  <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
Set Time Dialogue Box
When you're setting the time of an event with the Set Time dialogue box, you don't have to navigate up and down the vertical hour and minute bars. You can just tap the Start Time or End Time box and use your Graffiti pad to enter the times.

Write Stuff
With over 11,000 Palm OS applications just waiting to be downloaded, there's literally no end to the ways you can use your Visor handheld. Find out how reader Matthew S. used his to calculate complex traffic problems for Calgary's Transportation Department.

Visor Gets the Green Light

This summer I had the privilege of working for the Transportation Department of the City of Calgary here in Calgary, Canada. One of the projects I aided was a study into the start-up delays of vehicles once the traffic light turns green. There can be as much as a five second delay between when the light turns green and the rear axel of the first vehicle in the queue crossing into the intersection. This delay must be taken into account when trying to establish a value for the number of cars that can make it through a light in an hour of green time. This value, in turn, is used in many intersection decisions. 

Our task was to determine how many cars would make it through the intersection in one hour of green time (one hour of green time is the sum of the green times during each red, yellow, green phase until they total one hour). For this study, I downloaded a program SportsWatch v1.4 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3290.233.34125625> onto my Handspring Visor Deluxe, which allowed us to record every car crossing, something that would have been impossible with a simple stopwatch. It allowed us to time the crossing of the rear axel for every car in the queue, since when you hit the 'lap' button, it records the time elapsed and outputs it as text. From here, it is a simple matter of copying the results to a memo in memo pad and saving.

Back at the office, we were able to synchronize the Handspring Visor with the Palm Desktop software and the memos containing the information were suddenly digital documents, with no laborious data entry needed. The results could be cut and pasted into a simple MS Excel spreadsheet to be analyzed and used in our study. This made for a more complete dataset, and hopefully more credible conclusions. As well, the cumbersome task of entering the recorded data was avoided by utilizing the quick and simple synchronization system, saving us a considerable amount of time. The Handspring Visor helped to make the data collection process more complete, easier to accomplish, and more efficient to import after collection.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Write Stuff
	
It takes more than water and flame retardant to put out forest fires. Reader and firefighter Paul F. tells us how his Visor Prism helped rescue a crewmember and keep the flames at bay.

Jump in the Fire
	
I am a smokejumper for the US Forest Service <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5127.233.34125625> in Missoula, Montana. (For those who may not know, smokejumpers are airborne, forest fire fighters that parachute into remote mountainous terrain to fight wild fires). As a Foreman for the Missoula Smokejumpers I manage several programs and coordinate several projects. My Visor helps me to stay on top of all that administrative work; but more unique is how it helps me on fires. My Prism was particularly helpful on one fire this last summer.

	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0090/final/images/012802parachute.jpg>We had a late afternoon dispatch to the Gallatin National Forest just north of Yellowstone National Park in early August-another lightning ignited fire. We were flying over the scene about one hour after receiving the call. As the airplane circled the fire I noticed a couple of small spot fires quite a distance from the main fire. I had my Prism out with the Magellan GPS <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5128.233.34125625> Module installed so I quickly marked a couple of waypoints as we flew over the spots. Within a few minutes we were leaping out of the aircraft and floating down to our jump spot about a half mile from the fire. Unfortunately one of our fellow crewmembers was hurt on landing, and because no helicopter ambulances were available in the area, we were forced to utilize the Malmstrom Air Force air rescue helicopter about four hours away. With my Prism and GPS unit I was able to gather the latitude and longitude coordinates of our location. I had the phone number for the 40th Air Rescue Squadron in my address book and thus was able to call them up direct on our satellite phone and arrange for the evacuation of the injured jumper-giving them all the pertinent information, including our location.
	
The next day I grabbed pictures of the fire with my eyemodule2 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2342.11693.46460.5129.233.34125625>. The fire made some impressive runs as the day warmed up making for some dandy photo opportunities but making for tough firefighting. Luckily, with some fast action and hard work on our part, we were able to get the fire under control as the evening cooled. The pictures I captured with the eyemodule2 helped to make a very complete fire report at the end of the fire.

The next morning (Day 3) I again used the GPS. We had been unable to find the spots we'd seen from the airplane by gridding for them, as they were no longer showing any smoke. However, I was able to locate the spot fires that I had marked as waypoints from the air. And it was a good thing too! Two of the spots still had hot embers in them, and thus had potential to kick up and burn.

Well, as you can see, a Handspring Visor Prism can be a pretty useful tool, even in some pretty unlikely places. All that, and I could even play Solitaire when we got a chance to kick back and take a break!!

"FW: Business Rationale for Retention","
Rick, 

We are still going to need the business rationale for each employee placed on a retention or milestone program. This information will be required by the creditors. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance. 

Regards,
Frank


 -----Original Message-----
From: 	De Jesus, Frank  
Sent:	Thursday, January 17, 2002 8:40 PM
To:	Buy, Rick
Subject:	Business Rationale for Retention 


As per our discussion, the first step was to identify the participants in the retention program. The next step is to build the business case for why these employees are critical and irreplaceable to your business unit. Please provided a brief rational for why these employees were selected. Additionally, if there is a unique situation or circumstance that makes your area more vulnerable, please included in an overall business summary. For example: if your unit has a limited number of people supporting a critical area necessary to maintaining or increasing the value of the estate or the liquidation of assets, include this in your business summary. 

Demonstrate why it would be difficult to train someone else to perform a similar function. You should also comment on why the employee was recommended for the Milestone Program.  As you know this information is time sensitive, so please try and get it to me as soon as possible.  I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me on such short notice.  Please call me (5x3662) if you have any questions. 

Regards,
Frank

*****************************

SENATE REPUBLICANS TO INTRODUCE ""HOMELAND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2001""

Senate Republicans intend to introduce a scaled-back energy policy bill not only to underscore GOP commitment to pass an energy bill this session, but also to increase the pressure on Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-ND) to schedule a floor vote on energy legislation before the session concludes.  The measure, to be titled the ""Homeland Energy Security Act of 2001"" is expected to focus mainly on increasing domestic production of oil and gas.

The bill is anticipated to include a controversial provision to allow energy exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but is not expected to include other contentious provisions such as auto fuel-efficiency standards, greenhouse-gas emissions caps and electricity restructuring issues.

In a related development, President Bush has added energy policy to his short-list of ""must approve"" legislation during the current session of Congress.  The President said that ""the less dependent we are on foreign sources of crude oil, the more secure we are at home.""

For additional information on energy-related issues, contact Francis Dietz at 202.785.3756 or at dietzf@asme.org.

PIPELINE INDUSTRY CALLS FOR LEGISLATION TO INCREASE SECURITY

The U.S. pipeline industry is calling for federal legislation to reduce security risks and to respond to large-scale threats.  In response to a request for suggestions on how to improve energy infrastructure security by Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), the Interstate National Gas Association of America (INGAA) recommends that in cases of specific and significant threats, ""the federal government consider making military forces and equipment available to help protect and/or monitor sensitive pipeline facilities.""  INGAA also recommended that legislation be introduced to amend the Freedom of Information Act to clarify that security-sensitive data be protected from public disclosure. 

The American Gas Association (AGA) called for additional federal funding of research and development of new monitoring and detection equipment, as well as tax incentives that would allow natural gas utilities to recover the costs of enhancing energy infrastructure security.

Earlier this month, Chairman Bingaman introduced legislation to amend the Reclamation, Recreation Management Act of 1992 to provide security for dams, facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation.  To view a copy of that bill, S.1480, go to http://thomas.loc.gov/ and search by bill number.

KYOTO RULES TO BE FINALIZED LATER THIS MONTH IN MOROCCO

The U.S. is anticipated to send a delegation to the October 27-November 9 meeting in Marrakech, Morocco at which the final rules of a global treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are to be negotiated. However, the U.S. delegation will participate in a high-level segment of the meeting related to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change to which the U.S. is a party.  Because there are no plans for the U.S. to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the delegation will not participate in negotiations on implementing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the framework document. The Bush Administration, through the Environmental Protection Agency, is developing a plan to address climate change issues outside of the Kyoto Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol will enter into force and become legally binding after it has been ratified by at least 55 parties to the convention, including industrialized countries representing at least 55 percent of the total 1990 carbon dioxide emissions within that group.  Thus far, 40 countries have ratified the Protocol, including one industrialized country, Romania. For additional information, contact Francis Dietz at 202.785.3756 or at dietzf@asme.org.

""TECH TALENT"" BILL INTRODUCED IN HOUSE AND SENATE

Legislation designed to address the decline in the nation's technical workforce, and to improve undergraduate math and science education, has been introduced in both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The bi-partisan legislation, sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman (D-CT), Christopher Bond (R-MO), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Bill Frist (R-TN), Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) and John Larson (D-CT) would establish a competitive grants program through the National Science Foundation (NSF) to undergraduate institutions pledging to increase the number of U.S. citizens or permanent residents obtaining degrees in science, math, engineering and technology (SMET) fields.  A pilot program, which would award three-year grants, is authorized at $25 million in fiscal year 2002.  Funding increases are anticipated for out years.

The K-12 SMET Coalition, of which ASME's Council on Education is a member, has endorsed the legislation.  To view the letter, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-42.html. For additional information, contact Patti Burgio at 202.785.3756 or at burgiop@asme.org.

ASME OHIO COUNCIL URGES SUPPORT FOR TORT REFORM MEASURE

ASME's Ohio Council, representing over 4300 ASME members in the state, has sent a letter to Ohio legislators urging support for S.B. 120, a bill that would significantly improve the state's civil justice system by limiting joint and several liability. The measure, currently under consideration by the Ohio House Civil and Commercial Law Committee, would ensure that a defendant would have to pay only its proportionate share of damages, for those defendants found to be 50 percent or less at fault.  To view of a copy of the letter, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-41.html. For additional information on the bill, or on the Ohio Council, contact Gene Hulbert, ASME Ohio State Government Coordinator, at 614.882.0265 or hulbertL@asme.org.

NIST LAUNCHES NEW E-MAIL SERVICE TO TRACK FOREIGN REGULATION OF U.S. EXPORTS

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has launched a new e-mail service that advises U.S. businesses when foreign governments propose regulations that might influence the treatment of U.S. exports. Export Alert! Is an automated service that gathers, organizes and disseminates notifications of proposed regulatory changes issued by any of 142 nationals that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The early warning provided by Export Alert! is designed to ensure that subscribing U.S. organizations have adequate lead time to review and comment on proposed regulations.

To learn more about Export Alert!, go to www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-05.htm.  Information on how to subscribe to the service is available at http://ts.nist.gov/ncsci. For more detailed information, contact Mark Bello at mark.bello@nist.gov or at 301.975.3776.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

	The FBI and the Department of Justice have reviewed an Enron Org Chart current as of October 2001, and now are requesting individual Org Charts for your respective 	business units.

	They essentially are trying to understand the teams that work for/report in to each of you, and get a better feel for Enron's business and corporate staff functions.
	For the larger groups, your direct reports and key commercial and staff support should suffice. For the smaller groups, a more complete list of your team would be 	appreciated.

	At your earliest convenience, please provide me with a copy of the following Org Charts:

		1.	Enron Global Services - Stan Horton

		2.	Risk Management/Chief Risk Officer - Rick Buy

		3.	Enron Broadband Services - Jim Fallon

		4.	Accounting/Chief Accounting Officer - Rick Causey

		5.	Global Finance/Treasury - Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen

		6.	Investor Relations - Mark Koenig

		7.	Enron Wholesale Legal - Mark Haedicke

		8.	Corporate Secretary/Board Communications - Paula Rieker

		9.	Enron Principal Investments - Kevin Garland

	Please call with any questions or comments.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.

CONGRESS BACK IN SESSION

This week Congress returned to face a tough election year agenda on issues such as the economy, energy, trade and campaign finance.  The ability of both parties will be tested to overcome fierce partisan battles that stalled action last year.  
President Bush will help set the tone with Congress in his State of the Union address next Tuesday night, where lawmakers will watch to see if he outlines a confrontational or cooperative approach to key issues such as taxes and spending.
More information about the Congressional agenda can be found at:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21833-2002Jan22.html
For further information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.


PRESIDENT BUSH TO RELEASE BUDGET FEBRARY 4
While President Bush does not send his $2 trillion FY2003 budget to Congress until February 4, the Administration and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office severely downgraded their surplus forecasts this week.
While President Bush's budget will propose big boosts for defense and homeland security and a renewed drive for an economic stimulus bill, Bush will propose budgets cuts in the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior and Labor as well as Army Corps of Engineers' water projects.  Only a small overall increase for most remaining federal programs will be proposed.  Also projects such as the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Advanced Technology are slated to be eliminated in the Bush FY2003 budget.
A recent article on the surplus forecast and the upcoming budget can be found at: http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020124/ap_on_go_pr_wh/budget_19&cid=536
For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.


ICCFR&D MEETING TO ADDRESS BUSH FY2003 BUDGET

ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D (ICCFRD) of the Council on Engineering (COE) will meet February 13-14, 2002 in Washington, D.C., the week following the President's budget request for FY2003.
The ICCFR&D provides the mechanical engineering profession with a voice in the federal R&D budget process that incorporates the industrial and academic perspectives, the interaction of R&D and engineering education, and changing societal needs. 
Task Force Chairmen will participate in providing an analysis for their issue area of the President's FY2003 budget, which will be released to the Congress in early February 2002. That analysis will be used as ASME's contribution to an annual report prepared by the American Association for the Advancement of Science on research and development in the federal budget. In addition, the analysis will be used to prepare written or oral testimony on the agency budgets for Congressional hearings and for other purposes.
  
For more information, please contact Reese Meisinger at meisingerr@asme.org. 


A DAY AT THE CAPITOL TO BE HELD IN CALIFORNIA

ASME's Region IX will host the 5th Annual Day at the Capitol in Sacramento, California on February 5.   The program will focus on three issues: energy, transportation, and engineering licensing.  Visits will also be scheduled for the participants with Chairmen and Ranking Members of the appropriate committees of jurisdiction, as well as some individual visits with Assemblymen and Senators.  

For program and registration details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric

EPA ADDRESSING POWER PLANTS EMISSIONS
A legislative plan to control power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury will be released no later than mid-February by the Environmental Protection Agency, answering a request by the Bush Administration's National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG).  Around that time, the Senate is scheduled to begin action on competing legislation by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman, James Jeffords (I-VT).  
The two proposals is provision differ on strategies for controlling carbon dioxide.  The EPA legislation is not expected to contain such a provision; NEPDG had specified that the reductions be phased in and that EPA develop market-based incentives to assist utilities in complying.  An official from the Agency said the regulated community could save 25 percent to 30 percent more than the current regulatory structure, due to new technologies and greater flexibility for meeting environmental targets. 
Information about Jeffords' legislation, S. 556, can be found at:  http://thomas.loc.gov

COUNCIL ON BIOETHICS NAMED

President Bush has appointed an 18-member Council of Bioethics to address some of the more controversial aspects of the biotechnology field.  Last week the council held its first two-day meeting in Washington, D.C., which focused on human cloning as its first issue.  
The Council will consider a range of bioethical matters connected with specific biomedical and technological activities, such as embryo and stem cell research, assisted reproduction, cloning, uses of knowledge and techniques derived from human genetics or the neurosciences, and end-of-life issues. Broader ethical and social issues, such as the appropriate uses of biomedical technologies and the protection of human subjects in research, may also be considered.
A list and description of the Council members is available from the following White House press release: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020116-9.html
For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.


TERRORISM REINSURANCE LEGISLATION RE-EMERGING

Last week leadership from the Financial Services Roundtable, a group comprised of top executives with 100 large banking, insurance, and investment companies, met with President Bush and other top Administration officials to discuss its Congressional agenda, which includes enactment of a federal terrorism reinsurance bill.  

The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3210 on November 29, 2001.  The bill addresses key issues affecting civil litigation arising out of future terrorist attacks.  The bill currently awaits Senate consideration.   H.R.3210 would bar punitive damages, non-economic damages in excess of the defendant's direct proportion of responsibility for the plaintiff's physical harm, and suits against companies, building owners, security firms, or other businesses on the grounds that those entities were negligent and failed to protect people against attack, while capping attorney fees.
 
The House Financial Services Committee will be examining the economic impacts of the failure to enact terrorism reinsurance legislation.  More information about the hearing can be found at its web site at http://www.house.gov/financialservices/

States debating similar types of legislation are Alabama, California, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and West Virginia.  For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.

"A message from the Mayor of New York","Dear Colleague: 

I would like to direct your attention to a letter from New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, which you can find on the web site of the 2001 ASME International Mechanical Congress and Exposition: http://www.asme.org/congress

In the wake of September 11, Congress 2001 provides a special opportunity to consider our current challenges. Now more than ever, engineers need to share information and exchange views. 

Judging from early registration, we expect record attendance at this year's Congress, which will take place in New York on November 11-16. In addition to a truly outstanding technical program, participants will enjoy a wide range of opportunities for exploring the perspectives of colleagues from different companies, industries, and countries around the globe.            

I look forward to greeting you in New York next month. 

Sincerely,

I had my weekly update meeting with my team on metals and was quite encouraged by the report. Seems like real good progress on all fronts. As400 systems work, var implementation and trading results all seemed positive. Some issues around SAP/AS400 reconciliation but recognized.

Metals was one of my biggest worries but has slipped way down the list. Great work to your team.

"RE: EPI Watch List","Kevin:  It is understood and appreciated that EPI keeps all of their portfolio investments under close ""watch"".  The purpose of the report is more to provide management (some of them outside of EPI) an update on investments experiencing issues.  Additionally, the classifications ""Watch"", ""Troubled"", and ""Loss""  form the basis of a merchant investment portfolio report that Rick Buy provides to the Finance Committee at each Board meeting.  The Watch report provides RAC an opportunity to get EPI's input for that process. 
 
All that being said, we are certainly open to changes that help us better accomplish these objectives.  I am ready to discuss at your convenience.   Regards!     Rick C.

Subject:	Business Rationale for Retention 


As per our discussion, the first step was to identify the participants in the retention program. The next step is to build the business case for why these employees are critical and irreplaceable to your business unit. Please provided a brief rational for why these employees were selected. Additionally, if there is a unique situation or circumstance that makes your area more vulnerable, please included in an overall business summary. For example: if your unit has a limited number of people supporting a critical area necessary to maintaining or increasing the value of the estate or the liquidation of assets, include this in your business summary. 

Demonstrate why it would be difficult to train someone else to perform a similar function. You should also comment on why the employee was recommended for the Milestone Program.  As you know this information is time sensitive, so please try and get it to me as soon as possible.  I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me on such short notice.  Please call me (5x3662) if you have any questions.
