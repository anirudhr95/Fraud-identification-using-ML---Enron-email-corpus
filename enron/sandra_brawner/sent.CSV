"Greetings","Wanted to say Hello.  I must tell you I miss you, I don't have anyone to 
shake my head at anymore. Hoping all is well with the new position.  Also 
wanted to thank you for calling Pam I do appreciate that .  There are  plans 
are for my husband and I to meet some friends of yours this weekend.  We are 
getting together with the Schnitzers and they have invited the Kushnicks .  
Jon and Susan really enjoy them and have wanted to introduce us for some time

with Ray occasionally.  Steve without sounding abrupt I still have no 
intention of doing business with your shop.  That situation was difficult  
for several of us involved, and it is not something  that I believe I will 
forget. nor understand.

My bible study lasted until 9:00.  I was exhausted.  I had been on the phone
all day.  I am working this career thing very hard.  I am leaving in the
morning for Tulsa to look at houses and apartments.  I have not excepted the
job yet.  I have to be sure.  I also have some interviews set up for Monday
and Tuesday of next week.

I have to have faith that God will lead me in the right direction.

I have to call Susan and Jon and apologize.

What is Jon's phone number at work?

Pam

"Re:","Susan, 
We had the best time.  Good friends, great experiences, weather , etc.  Now 
we all want to move to  Denver.  I am glad that Bens outfit worked out so 
well.
I thought it was cute and I could picture him wearing it when I purchased 
it.  So-------are you still planning the retreat weekend?  I am soooo 
jealous.  I would love to go but as I said I can not justify the expense.  
Any consideration to something a little more modestly priced?  Do you already 
have the plans made?  
Call me or write me back.   Hey - I am getting more and more excited about 
NYC.

"Apology","Jeff,
I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a 
professional manner.  I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket 
case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I 
just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.

In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is 
so Shankman)  - Sorry I will not be able to attend. But thanks for asking.

And lastly, Wes Walton how?  2001 Candy Apple Ferrari !!!

"Re:","Hello Bill,

It was great to get your note today.  I also think of you often.  Thanks for 
the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where 
we've been and where it seems we are going.  Work is going well,  Business 
with Prebon is still null.  Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a 
great person and a  good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has 
any good information and markets anymore.  It is sad actually, ever since you 
left the group things have never been the same.  YOU made a big difference 
there.

Yes I would love to try and meet with you.  I need more information though.  
Things are kinda hectic here and at home so timing is everything for me these 
days.  Lunch is out of the question.  So we are looking at drinks or dinner.  
the week of the 20th is better.  The week of the 25th is not going to be easy 
cuz it is settlement week.

Pam is doing fine.  Still looking for a job.  Hopefully something will happen 
soon.  She had mentioned that you wrote a note,  I guess I got the impression 
she had replied.  She is a little stressed in trying to get things settled in 
her life so just give her some time.

Just a quick note to say ""thank you"" for your comments at year end.  I

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, ""Preacher's Ass shows"". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, ""Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!""

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; ""Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass."" 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, ""Nun has the best Ass in town."" 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, ""Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks."" 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

My bible study lasted until 9:00.  I was exhausted.  I had been on the phone
all day.  I am working this career thing very hard.  I am leaving in the
morning for Tulsa to look at houses and apartments.  I have not excepted the
job yet.  I have to be sure.  I also have some interviews set up for Monday
and Tuesday of next week.

I have to have faith that God will lead me in the right direction.

I have to call Susan and Jon and apologize.

What is Jon's phone number at work?

Pam

Sandra,
???? 
???? The email that you sent me last Thursday has bothered me the entire 
weekend.? That is why I am emailing you from home.? I just want you to know 
my true intention of the email I sent you that day.
???? First and foremost,?I invited you and Kenny out for drinks, or a dinner, 
as friends.? I repeat,?""as friends"" and nothing more.? I said in that email 
that business does not have to be discussed and?I meant it.? As far as 
the?Enron/Natsource?""deal"" that you are talking about.....it had nothing to 
do with the email I sent you.? As far as I know, that ""deal"" has been in the 
works since September/October between Jack Cogan and Andy Zipper.? So I want 
it to be clear to you that the ""deal"" had nothing to do with me sending you 
that email.
???? As a matter of fact, the reason why I sent you that email and invited 
you out was because of the last time we spoke.? Remember when I instant 
messaged you?? The reason why I approached you that way was because I thought 
we were close enough friends that I could.? As?I found out, I was wrong.? 
However, when I spoke to you that day, on the phone, and asked if I could ask 
you out in the future ( when?I come to Houston).....you said I could.? I have 
planned to come down for weeks.? Even though you choose to not deal with 
Natsource, I still considered you a?friend and thought it would be 
appropriate to ask you out.....and so?I did.
???? As you know, I take things to heart.? I was really upset with 
the?response I got from you.? I am emailing you from home because it bothered 
me so much that I needed to make sure you understood my true intentions.? I 
hope I have done that.
???? Finally, I just want to say that I will not bother you again.? I just 
want you to know that?I have always tried to do the right thing.? I feel as 
though you are questioning everything I say or do and that you believe there 
are?ulterior motives behind my actions.....and it just isn't true!??With 
that, I wish nothing but good things for you and your family.
?
???? good bye,
???????????????? Ray?

 My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves 
in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any business 
dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that Matt and 
Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I do not 
believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to do 
business with Natsourse today or in the future.

Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

                           Tribune Media 

                           For the many millions of individuals who have yet 
to file their 2000 income tax returns, there is no
                           reason to panic. 

                           If you need more time to file your return, you can 
easily get a filing extension. 

                           And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now, 
you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be
                           subject to interest and penalties for payments 
made after April 16, you can put off the day of
                           reckoning for months without fear that IRS 
collection agents will come after you. There is even a
                           loophole in the law that will enable many 
individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being
                           assessed interest or penalties. 

                           Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for 
anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need
                           to file either your tax return or an extension 
request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and
                           penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes 
owed by April 16. 

                           April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA 
contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first
                           installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001. 

                           Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file 
your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact,
                           the IRS has expanded the options this year for 
obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by
                           phone, computer or mail. 

                           The traditional way to get an extension is to fill 
out IRS Form 4868, ""Application for Automatic
                           Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return"" and mail it to the IRS by the April 16
                           deadline. If you're using tax-preparation software 
or a tax professional, you can file your extension
                           request by computer. Or you can phone in your 
extension request by calling 888-796-1074. 

                           If you owe the IRS money, another option for 
requesting an extension is to make the payment by
                           credit card (American Express, Discover or 
MasterCard) on the Internet or by phone through one
                           of the two companies the IRS has authorized for 
processing credit card payments. Details on the
                           option are included in the Form 4868 instructions. 

                           By making the extension request, the IRS will 
automatically give you four more months, until Aug.
                           15, to file your return. 

                           You can get an extension for any reason. No 
explanation is asked for when requesting an extension. 

                           But be aware that your extension request only 
gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay
                           your taxes. To avoid interest and possible penalty 
charges, you must estimate how much you owe
                           and make the payment with your extension request 
by the April 16 deadline. 

                           Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax 
bill, you should at least file an extension request by
                           the April 16 deadline. 

                           Though you'll be subject to interest and possible 
penalty charges for late payment of your taxes,
                           you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, 
which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a
                           maximum 25 percent.) 

                           Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash 
to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out
                           on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay 
your balance due in monthly installments. You
                           make the request for an installment agreement when 
you file your completed tax return using Form
                           9465, ""Installment Agreement Request."" 

                           ""Offer in compromise"": If you can't afford to pay 
all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a
                           period of years, you may be able to work out a 
settlement with the IRS. The IRS recently expanded
                           its ""Offer in Compromise"" program, in which 
taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle
                           for less than they owe. Offers are submitted using 
IRS Form 656, ""Offer in Compromise."" 

                           A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all 
you need is an extra month or so to come up with
                           the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you 
may be able to get a short reprieve without being
                           subject to interest or penalties. 

                           All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to 
calculate your tax bill for you. 

                           If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your 
tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and
                           send it in by April 16. The IRS will compute your 
tax and send you a bill for any tax owed. If you
                           pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be 
assessed any penalties or interest. 

                           To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable 
income must be less than $100,000 and you can't
                           itemize deductions. The full list of eligibility 
requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained
                           in IRS Publication 967, ""The IRS Will Figure Your 
Tax."" 

                           Retirement account contributions: If you hope to 
contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the
                           final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is 
April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension. 

                           The deadline is more flexible for self-employed 
retirement plans. Contributions to Keogh or
                           Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be 
made up until the due date of your return, which
                           can be later than April 16 with a filing 
extension. 

                           Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers 
and other individuals who need to make
                           quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 
16 also is the deadline for making the first
                           installment for 2001.

A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her 
tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a 
gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red 
tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, ""What do you do to get your tomatoes so 
red?"" The gentleman responded, ""Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato 
garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much."" 

 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, ""By the way, 
How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?"" 

""No"" she replied, ""but my cucumbers are enormous!""
