Importance:	High

1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.   

2.  I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.

Stacey,

Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:

career services@enron.com

It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
not accept a blank space.

I tried emailing to
       careerservices@enron.com
       career.services@enron.com
       career_services@enron.com

Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.

Thanks

Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
will be able to call a few people in the morning.

we might make a small exception for you.  I think we should start off with a
small novella, written by Steve Martin.  Yes, Steve Martin, the comedian.
He has a short book in the stores; he has written.  It is called Shopgirl.
The reviews in Amazon are fairly good.  Does anyone else have a good
suggestion?  I think meeting in the beginning of February would be a good
idea. -Christina
P.S. We miised you, Kelly and Anna at my fine party(oh yeah it was for Kelly

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"FW: Customer List","Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.

Hi Stacey,
I work in the fundamentals group in Portland and receive the forward power curves daily via e-mail to import them into our database for our traders here.  I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,

Stacey,

Let me know if this is what you are looking for.


Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date.

John and Fran-

The Creditors committee is coming in this afternoon and requested reports showing the value of the deals we have in our bankruptcy portfolios.  Given the time crunch, I ran the WestBank calc also and included in the information I sent to Debbie Brackett.  There were a few counterparties that I deleted from your query because they were not listed in the Terminated Counterparties file.  They were BPENERGYCO (Financial Deals, but net value = $0) and PUDSNOHOMISHCTY (Financial).  I also did not have time so see if all of your Dec-01 information was correctly split based on each counterparty's effective termination date.  Did you guys have a chance to go through that information?

Thanks!

Subject:	index option

Hi Stacey:

  Just want to follow up to see if there is any after thought about what we discussed yesterday on Index Option.  From our discussion, index option will be reported in two records:  reported as physical in the delivery region, and financial in the index region with the corresponding position and risks.    This seems to be a better alternative than reporting the collapsed position in the delivery region in one record or reporting both position as physical  in two records in the delivery and index region.  

   Could you please let me know if we should go ahead  implementing the changes?  We plan to move the current stage to production tonight and do a new stage release this week, I'd like this change, if going to occur, to go into this release.

   Thanks a lot.

- Zhiyun

I put the 11/30 strip back in the deal.  The ""884449 in bankruptcy"" does refer to another deal that we created due to Aquila terminating transactions with us.  The reason you cannot see it is because you probably do not have access to the new portfolio.

Sent:	Friday, November 30, 2001 5:58 PM
To:	All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON
Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"FW: west bankruptcy deals","Just wanted to make sure you had the latest files of terminated counterparties.

Subject:	west bankruptcy deals

John:

So far I know we have three lists going around associated with moving west deals to the bankruptcy portfolios:
   
The first list is what I got from you => we added the deal comments together.
The second list is from Casey => Sam and I changed the deal termination dates in each deal 
The third list is from Will Smith => Will Smith changed the deals listed from the original desk to the bankruptcy desk

However, I am not sure if these three lists together provide the whole picture of what we have done so far.  Per Stacey's instructions, after we changed the termination dates, I exported ad hoc for the bankruptcy and west portfolios and found below issues:
 
a. some counterparties showing up in the bankruptcy portfolio are listed in any one of the above three files.  Please see this attachment and look at those not highlighted in yellow.
 
b. for some counterparties we still have deals in the days after the termination date.  Please see this attachment and look at those highlighted in orange and red.
 
* AQUILA: please check out deal # 656568 and # 569156.  According to Will Smith's list, the termination date for AQUILA should be 11/30/01.  However these two deals are not changed accordingly.
* ELPASOMERLP: according to the termiation dates list (from Casey), are we terminating all deals with this cp on 12/3/01?  If yes there are a bunch of deals left unchanged in the west portfolio for the rest of the month.  For example, #883630 has volumes for 12/4/01-12/31/01 under STNW desk.  There are many more deals like this.  Please search in deal entry to see all.
* Same case for MORGAN.  Example # 884431.1 in which we have volumes for all December 01' but according to the termination dates list, the termination date for this counterparty should be 12/7/01
* SMUD: please check deal# 647957.  This financial swap is still as it has been, i.e. under LTCA book for Q2 02'.  But according to Will Smith's list, the termination date for the counterparty should be 11/30/01?

If you could please help me look at this I will appreciate it very much.

Thanks,
Fran

Yes, you will do normal calculation tonight.  In addition, either today or tomorrow, please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio.  Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial.  Compare the data to the Termination Lists.  All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio.  If you notice discrepencies, please investigate and correct.  Also, Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on.  Do you know if this affected the West?  If so, you will need to wait until he is complete.

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Subject:	Final Review

I just wanted to give you an up date on the review with Heather. My primary focus with her was taking on to much responsibility and not focusing enough on the end results of her project such as Renewables. She just needs to spend more time ensuring that the numbers being reported are correct and accurate the first time, not after it goes into production. There had also been a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day to day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead of verbally and as a result Heather is left out. I was thinking of telling everyone that there should be no use of the messaging system for business related issues within our group and also implementing the assigning of responsibilities to people for a couple of weeks then rotating it around. That way nobody can say somebody else is not helping enough. All in all it went well otherwise. She is was very receptive to my concerns and readily admitted to areas of improvement.

Couple of other things that I got from the meetings that might help the group. The first is an informational meeting with settlements and maybe accounting to understand what they do with the reports that we send each month and secondly, another meeting (hopefully better) regarding VaR and how the reports that we produce are used.

I can easily put in prices for the earlier months.  My only worry is that it may affect EES since they have current Ontario positions that should not be valued against my curve (they should use regulated rates until market opening).

Garrett,
Recognizing that Ontario does not open until Mar 02, and recognizing that we have positions starting then, and recognizing that the curve doesn't have prices posted for reference dates prior to Mar 02, the value-at-risk engine is getting errors in it's simulations due to lack of prices thereof.  

Can you do either of the below?
?	Post prices for dates up to Mar 02?  (realize their isn't market?.tough issue)
o	If you post a price, I'm not sure it will mean much other than letting VAR run, primarily because there isn't position prior to Mar 02. Perhaps you can fill in hole with a realistic price so prompt month correlations don't go wacko?I guess.. Stacey help. 
?	Recommend a ""like"" curve to map R20 to so that we can get around zero price issues?  Realize that mapping will include entire term structure and not just for the reference dates with zero price.
?	Other ideas?

I appreciate your help in working toward a solution.

Thanks,
Frank

Stacey wanted to let you know that myself and the rest of the group feel and know that Nick does not want to be here. You could tell during the conference call yesterday with you that he was somewhat disappointed that he was not laid off. He has other avenues that I think he wants to pursue. Wanted to know if we have any recourse on this since he under contract right now. I have not approached him about it but have been tempted to just so he will get his act together. Here is a person who would rather be laid off than continue to work while people have been laid off who do not want to leave. It has rubbed some people the wrong way. 

We are overstaffed currently and we would not lose a step with one less person.

Let me know your thoughts,

Stacey, part of my relocation package was the $700/month mortgage subsidy. In May, I received the first installment for one year and due to the current situation with the company and with Enron at this point unsure about helping with a potential move back to Houston, I wanted to receive the second installment as soon as possible. Frank is ok with this, but I wanted to check with you before anything else is done.

Good Morning Stacey,

Jeff Richter wants to start trading ancillary service deals through EOL.  To help facilitate this new business, we need to setup several new pub codes that represent the indexes the California ISO publishes for ancillary services.  A few of the ancillary pub codes are already setup we just need to add the ones for spin & non-spin.  Do you know who we need to get with to have these new pub codes setup?  I will work with the IT guys to ensure the programs that scrape the ISO site and store the prices are updated to capture these new indexes.

Thanks,  David Poston

ps - Please give me a call if you have any questions, 57834


These pub codes already exist:

ISOGRRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLRRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26


These pub codes need to be created:

ISOGSRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLSRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

ISOGNRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)

Hi Stacey:

  Thanks for the background and insight information.  

  For weekly options, if there is any, we are still using the monthly-daily blending formula, there's no different blending rules applied right now.  

  From your email, I get it that for all deal types in East portfolio, no blending should be applied, this includes deals whose expiry frequency is embedded in the deal type but not explicitly specified (such as transmission deals) in deal entry.  If this understanding is correct, we'll need to make code changes, please let us know if we should start implementing that or wait till after the meeting.

  Thanks,

Subject:	RE: volatility

The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  

	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.

	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.

	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.

	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.

Hi Hai:

  Here's the logic about volatility.  Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility.  From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option.    The implication of that is that for 

1. other portfolios,
2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now),
3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined,

the blend approach will still be applied.  Please let us know if you have any concerns.

There are a few things that we need to compile for the Estate.
 
1) Please load your December liquidations into your ""flash"" database so that I can get a good number for Gas December liquidations.
 
2) TG - need your liquidation file from power risk.
 
3) We need to find out which books have deals with Canada, gas and power.  For the gas books, these deals had to remain in the original book because  risk could not move these to the Gas Price book because of the pricing structure.  TG - for the power books, can you check with Stacey?
 
4) Also, we need to get a list of books, gas & power, that have a gross book balance as of 12/31/2001.
 
Put your lists together in the attached template and send back to me.  Let's try to have this data ""rounded"" up by tomorrow morning at 10:00 am.  I'm sure that this will not be all the data that is needed, but I'll let you know as soon as I get the requests.

Would I also be able to get this calculation as of the 28th.  This would have been backed with deals between ECC and ENA and these deals were terminated Dec 28th.

"Tomorrow To Do","We will be running a December MTD DPR tomorrow.  Before we start this process please recalc the East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank portfolios to AdHoc.  Check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the Bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the East and West portfolios.

Before kicking off the calcs, double check the specific deals that are listed on the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet.  I believe there were whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by Will that should never have been moved, because they were already liquidated in November.  Also, I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations.  There is one counterparty (TXU) added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs.  In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling.

Before recalcing the Bank portfolios, please contact Debbie Brackett or Stephanie McGinnis (4-2022) to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios.

We should still be calcing on 'No True-up'.  Casey, I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble.  At this point, we are going for reasonableness with numbers.  All the previous top-levels in our rolls (as of the 3rd or 4th) will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power.  The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account.  These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios.  Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations.  These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E.

When running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios, we will not be flat.  Currently, we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling.  (Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and Cara).  The settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process.

Tomorrow should be a blast - I can't wait!!!

Partnership
Spurs Enron
Equity Cut
---
Vehicle Is Connected
To Financial Officer
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller

10/18/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page C1 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Enron Corp. shrank its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as the company decided to repurchase 55 million of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron didn't disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a $1.01 billion charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a $618 million loss. But the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity has dropped to $9.5 billion, the company said. 
In an interview Tuesday, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said that about $35 million of the $1.01 billion charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Mr. Fastow. In a conference call yesterday with investors, Mr. Lay said that the 55 million shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 million. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Mr. Causey didn't elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
In addition, Enron was receiving increasing criticism from analysts and major shareholders concerning the apparent conflict of interest involving the role of its chief financial officer in the partnership, from which he stood to make millions of dollars. In July, Mr. Fastow formally severed his connections to LJM. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, ""the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,"" Mr. Causey said. 
Enron downplayed the significance of the share-reduction exercise. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described it ""as just a balance-sheet issue"" and therefore wasn't deemed ""material"" for disclosure purposes. 
Jeff Dietret, an analyst for Simmons & Co. in Houston, said that a large reduction of equity could be ""a flag for the rating agencies"" because it could adversely affect a company's debt-to-equity ratio. Enron said yesterday that as a result of the equity reduction, its debt-to-equity ratio rose to 50% from 46% previously. 
On Tuesday, after Enron reported its big quarterly loss, Moody's Investors Service Inc. put Enron's long-term debt on review for a possible downgrade. Moody's said the move was related to ""significant write-downs and charges reflecting substantially reduced valuations"" in several of Enron's businesses. In recent years, Enron had moved aggressively into broadband telecommunications and the water business, both of which failed to produce expected returns. 
Enron, which as of June 30 had $33.6 billion in current liabilities and long-term debt, has lately been attempting to shed assets to pay down debt.

Subject:	DprAutomation with Financial Swap Liqudation is ready

Dear Casey, J.P.

The first version of new DprAutomation with Financial Swap Liquidation and other changes is ready for testing. The set of files is saved at 
M:\Power_devl\Test\Swap Liq\

Since the driver and folder are moving around at this moment, all files in that folder must be keeping under same folder.

The formula for Swap Liq is the same as previous agreement.

Also Swap Liq have been rewritten. It is automation row.  It can pull all files from Unix and without manually pulling them via PortCal. The Calculate time for each pair desk/region also has been cut from about 2 minutes down to about 5 seconds. Total time for adding J9 issue is less 5 minutes at this time.

For roll files, I change some tabs names to match their names in Oracle region name. Otherwise, DprAutomation can't work.
 
If you really need the regions names as your new rolls file, I am going to find a way to hard code mapping  them in DprAutomation. However, we think the best way is setup those change in Oracle database. 

All files in that folder are copy files. Any change only affects those copy files.

The tabs names I change in copy rolls are:
R1:  NY Zone G -> NY EAST 
R1A: PJM West -> PJM 
R1C: NY Zone A -> NY WEST
R1D: PJM EASTTERN Hub -> EASTTERN Hub 
R1Z: PJM WESTTERN Hub -> WESTTERN Hub
R3B: TVA -> Into TVA
R4C: Comed -> Into Comed 

I will continue to test, optimize and  polish the Swap Liq and DprAutomation.

Please let us know if there is any correction or any problem.

Thanks!

Min Zheng

Also, could you let me know where is your latest roll files location. I need to COPY those files to my PC and have a full test on those COPY files.

Hi,

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

James

Importance:	High

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Min Zheng

The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.

Subject:	UBS Data Migrations


I have received several questions from the floor regarding the subject topic.  Here is what I know as of 2:00 today.  This is an evolving process.  Please distribute this note as appropriate:

All movement of 'data' from Enron to UBS is subject to legal approval.  Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.

Data can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)

Data is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. 

Several steps have already been completed:

The physical file server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.
Some file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.
Our large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.

Where do we stand?

I am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.
Legal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)
At this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.
We have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.

I will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.

Thanks, Steve

Dear Stacey,

	Wei's email is about how to capture Power PortCalc positions and P&L into the RiskTrac ( VATR) system. Both Spread Option and Index-Option's positions are stored in two columns in the VATR result table, whereas an Option deal would be in one column only, so Wei has to treat Index-Option the same as Spread Option in capturing the numbers.
	
	Regards,


Norman.

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Regards,

Wei

We think the best option is to balance the month with a sale/purchase at $R0 price and push the income and cash payment/receipt into the future.  Remi is giving us a Dec 2002 expected settlement date which is discounted at about 25%.

Other than Lavo's approval does there have to been sound rationale for a Schedule C for AA?

Hi Stacey:

  Just want to follow up to see if there is any after thought about what we discussed yesterday on Index Option.  From our discussion, index option will be reported in two records:  reported as physical in the delivery region, and financial in the index region with the corresponding position and risks.    This seems to be a better alternative than reporting the collapsed position in the delivery region in one record or reporting both position as physical  in two records in the delivery and index region.  

   Could you please let me know if we should go ahead  implementing the changes?  We plan to move the current stage to production tonight and do a new stage release this week, I'd like this change, if going to occur, to go into this release.

   Thanks a lot.

Edie,

Per our conversation last night, attached is the lowest level of detail we can provide for EOPS allocations to EA.  EOPS doesn't track these costs at the cost center level.  If you would like for us to provide the plan at a lower level than this, please review the categories and provide us with a further allocation and I will use your allocations on the template for Thursday.  If we can't make it by Thursday, we can provide this level and maybe later we can go back and do a further breakdown.  If you have any questions, please call.

One more thing, this file has not been finalized or blessed so it is preliminary and subject to change.  It should give you a good basis to start breaking it out.

Stacey wanted to let you know that myself and the rest of the group feel and know that Nick does not want to be here. You could tell during the conference call yesterday with you that he was somewhat disappointed that he was not laid off. He has other avenues that I think he wants to pursue. Wanted to know if we have any recourse on this since he under contract right now. I have not approached him about it but have been tempted to just so he will get his act together. Here is a person who would rather be laid off than continue to work while people have been laid off who do not want to leave. It has rubbed some people the wrong way. 

We are overstaffed currently and we would not lose a step with one less person.

Let me know your thoughts,

this covers just about everyone I know.


Unfortunately, the last one did apply to me.  Happy Holidays.  :-)

  . 1. Your potted plants are alive. And you can't smoke a one of them.
    2. Having sex in a twin-sized bed is absurd.
    3. You keep more food than beer in the fridge.
    4. 6:00 AM is when you get up, not when you go to sleep.
    5. You hear your favorite song on an elevator.
    6. You carry an umbrella. You watch the Weather Channel.
    7. Your friends marry and divorce instead of hookup and breakup.
    8. You go from 130 days of vacation time to 7.
    9. Jeans and a sweater no longer qualify as 'dressed up.'
    10. You're the one calling the police because those darn kids next
        door don't know how to turn down the stereo.
    11. Older relatives feel comfortable telling sex jokes around you.
    12. You don't know what time Taco Bell closes anymore.
    13. Your car insurance goes down and your car payments go up.
    14. You feed your dog Science Diet instead of McDonald's.
    15. Sleeping on the couch makes your back hurt.
    16. You no longer take naps from noon to 6 p.m.
    17. Dinner and a movie - The whole date instead of the beginning of one.
    18. Eating a basket of chicken wings at 3 a.m. would severely upset,
        rather than settle, your stomach.
    19. You go to the drugstore for Ibuprofen and antacids, not condoms
        and pregnancy test kits.
    20. A $4.00 bottle of wine is no longer 'pretty good stuff.'
    21. You actually eat breakfast foods at breakfast time.
    22. ""I just can't drink the way I used to,"" replaces ""I'm never going to
drink that much again.""
    23. Over 90% of the time you spend in front of a computer is for real
work.
    24. You don't drink at home to save money before going to a bar.
    25. You read this entire list looking for one sign that doesn't apply to
you.

I have open questions for:

Stacey - 2 west pwr books (by the way, good job on the gas books you guys have - I spoke with Casey and she'll officialize these tonight for the last time and we'll inactivate them tomorrow)
Todd - GRM & weather - do you know when you might be able to start officializing these again?
Michelle/Mark/John S - there are still a few books (exotics etc) that we should figure out what should be done
David Oliver - UK-CRD-BRN-PRC - Mark said this one would be officialized.  It showed up as not officialized this am.
Sheri - the exotic price still isn't being officialized.  Where do we stand on that one?
Matt - steel & lumber - they showed up - we rolled the files from yesterday and uploaded them this morning - is this okay or were there terminations run through?

Thanks

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002

First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Stacey,

Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:

career services@enron.com

It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
not accept a blank space.

I tried emailing to
       careerservices@enron.com
       career.services@enron.com
       career_services@enron.com

Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.

Thanks

Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
will be able to call a few people in the morning.

Freight exotic - this hasn't been officialized for days - what's the status here?
Gas - they are still working to officialize the 12ths (should be done by 10 am this am) and then will do the 13th - there were problems deleting the interdesk transactions.  Jeff will let me know when they are done and we can rerun VAR/credit.
Power - a few EPMI books showed up.
Lumber - I probably need to reload the 12ths, but waiting on confirmation.
Liquids - a few exotics books showed up as well as 1 UK book that has been officialized in the recent past, I'm not sure of the status of these going forward.

Richter reserved that last year.  He made the money.  It's his.  It goes against refund risk in California.  If we take a hit in CA due to refunds, Richter should eat a good chunk of that hit -- if there is extra money then he should keep it.

John has asked me to do a thorough review of our Schedule C reserves in light of the northwest refund decision, BPA's new contracts that started in October, and the overall lower price environment.  Richter's reserves will be a part of this bigger effort that I will get done this week.

"Schedule E Reconciliation","After talking to Tom I have a new plan of attack for Schedule E's.  He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll.  I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc (post id 15667).  Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's.  This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots.

I have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from.  Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book.  In addition, there are no volumes in this deals; however, if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal.  It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD (11678.4, and 564826.1).  Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different.  I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 (they are in Casey's chair) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc.  I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc.  I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc.  Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details.

Other than Andrea who has to perform some IT testing, no one should be working (or playing) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out.  The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers.

Do we need to get together to discuss this?

Steve, I wanted to send this email in reference to Min Zhen with regards to the fact that he has not been included as one of the employees that will be a part of the new company. I wanted to make you aware of the fact the West and Canada power risk management groups consider Min to be a vital and very important part of the IT support that we receive. His knowledge and understanding of several very important excel macros that we use daily is critical to the success of our groups. It must be noted that on several occasions when other people were asked for help in areas that Min supports, the response was slow as people tried to understand what the problem was and how to fix it. I feel that is very important and necessary that Min be a part of the staff for the new company to ensure that all the risk groups continue to receive the exceptional support that we have come to expect from him.

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a ""?"" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is ""wait 60 days on PX""...""annuity 4 sale back to them"".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Hope this helps.

1)  Only the power positions need to be queried.  Gas positions for spread options and heat rates are included in the gas bench.

2)  Any power Exchange transactions should be included, but the gas transactions calculated in ERMT should not be included as they are on the gas bench.

Dear Tom,

	 1) Are you only interested in the Power positions? Do you need the Gas position for a Spread Option deal? 

	 2)  Do you want only the Post IDs officialized by Power PortCalc, so the Exchange deals' position calculated in ERMT need not be included?

	 3)  Can the results be in vertical format? e.g.

	East	Nov-01		100
	East	Dec-01		200

	West	Nov-01		101

Hi Norman. I've tried running some queries using Adhoc and I always get too detailed information. We only need total MONTHLY peak and off-peak positions for a couple of portfolios.

I've attached a file to illustrate the information we need. Can you please take a quick look and let me know if it would be possible to write a query to generate the info on a daily basis. Since the query may take a while to run, and we need the info by 7:00AM everyday, I would prefer to automatically run the query at say 5AM?

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

Subject:	New West Power Deal Info

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

Subject:	risk books for December

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks

"FW: Option Sensitivity","Keith, 

Here are the procedures for the East.  The West is not currently running option sensitivities. 

Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  (Reminder:  the increments are changeable)  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only.

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject:	RE: New Curves - REVISED AGAIN

Hi Frank.

Rakesh and I talked with Narshima Mistra, ancillary trader at EES.  The ancillary curve exists almost every power curve and it's more related to the capacity availability rather than market prices. Obviously it's indirectly related to prices since cost of generation, which is one important factor of constraints in the capacity of generation.  So EES has a table of ancillary service price % to generation cost.(Below)  I think this table can be used to simulate the ancillary prices by mapping to regional curves after the modification based on the market prices.  The problem is the illiquidity of this market. The price is reported once in a month as average point, so the RAC should identify the risk in this market, e.g. is it reasonable to get the daily value at risk.  Once again, as long as the daily prices of the ancillary is given, the implementation will be available by doing analysis on the data and making table like below to use in mapping curves.

the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently.
Using jumps would be appropriate for them.

The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Everyone,

As we prepare to re-launch the website, we're planning a simulation session for our traders and originators for next week (tentatively Monday).  This session will be similar to the ones we had before the initial launch of EnronOnline.  In brief, the goals are:

Test the integrity/functionality of the system and related processes,
Get everyone re-acclimated with the system and processes (traders, originators, credit, operations, help desk, et al), and
Show how the trading system and our processes work to the UBS staff visiting next week.

In order for the simulation to be successful, we will need to ensure that the simulation environment is exactly like the ""live"" trading environment.  We will need to coordinate with each one of you about what needs to get done to make this possible.  I will be sending out an invite for a meeting tomorrow morning.  Please make sure you attend to discuss what needs to get done on your end (setting up trader/counterparty profiles, credit headroom, etc.), as this simulation has been requested for early next week.  If you have prior commitments, please appoint someone from your group to fill in for you.

Feel free to call me with any questions.

Regards,
Rahil

All, 
I received a call from Sally Beck today alerting me to concerns about spreading the risk group across the floor (gas team - power team).  From a control perspective she prefers that the team be all together.  

Can you factor this in and give Sally and me your thoughts as well?  Perhaps we could find an area that is more central to both groups that will help with this (as we've done with fundies).  

Scott and I are meeting Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 - Lloyd and Sally are you free to join us to keep us all on the same page?  Please let me know so I can reserve a room.

Subject:	reports need to be restored

Dear Stacey and Fran:

  Both of you have asked me to restore some portcalc reports, some of the request was due back to even early this year.  I submitted all those request to the Unix team, but due to what happened to the company recently, apparently things are not kept in track very well and some people who used to work on the restoration has left without leaving a clear status notification.  

  I was asked by the Unix group to put together all the reports that still need to be restored and submit it to them again.  I'm wondering if you can provide me with a current list.   

  I'm very sorry that I have to ask you to do this, but I think by putting together a complete list and getting rid of those we no longer need, we can get things done in the shortest time.

  Thanks a lot.

The data was pulled from AdHoc by calculating East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank.  However, the total we retrieved from AdHoc did not match the total Portcalc value.  I do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error.  There are too many variables that are unknown.

The good thing is, it works now.

Hi Stacey:

  We were able to pull out the P&L vs Counter Party for the four Post IDs, and the total matched the $986,414,195 you gave, it seems that there are more counterparties than what you included in the spreadsheet.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for details.

 << File: PL_11_30_2001recalc.xls >> 

  Could you let us know how the number in your spreadsheet was generated?  Was it from DPR or some other spreadsheet?  Maybe we can take a look at the query to see if something is missed.

  Thanks,

The option query that we ran this morning does not tie back to AdHoc.  I first realized it when I was trying to clean up deals that had many strips.  There were instances where the P&L and delta were not consistent for every strip so I looked in AdHoc to see which number was right and that is when I started noticing inconsistencies.  Could you please query the P&L and Delta for the following deal numbers in spreadsheet.  The only way I have to do this is to query each deal separately in AdHoc.  Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject:	NETCO


The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Stacey, part of my relocation package was the $700/month mortgage subsidy. In May, I received the first installment for one year and due to the current situation with the company and with Enron at this point unsure about helping with a potential move back to Houston, I wanted to receive the second installment as soon as possible. Frank is ok with this, but I wanted to check with you before anything else is done.

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Regards,

Wei

Though TXU has not delivered EPMI notice thereof, the wholesale power trading relationship with TXU Energy Trading Company should be considered terminated effective December 2, 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in Section 4.2 of the 4-1-98 Master Energy Puurchase and Sale Agreement between them and EPMI.

The attachment reflects updates reviewed this afternoon arising out of additional credit war room files. Please note that the following counterparties should now be considered to have terminated their wholesale power enabling agreements with EPMI, and performance under any transactions with such parties, if any, should cease: 

AES New Energy, 
Cargill Alliant LLC, 
CP&L, 
OG&E, and 
Southern Illinois Power Cooperative.    

Rainbow and Split Rock have indicated that it was not their intention under their previous correspondence to have terminated, though EPMI may ultimately contest this (no right to partial termination).

Please contact me with any questions, or additional information you may obtain.  David Portz (ext 39239)

Stacey,

I have reviewed the section on the attachment of counterparties on the master log with a ""Y"" but not on the physical power terminated list.  BP Energy Company is on the physical power terminated list.  With the exception of the four new companies that appeared on the master list today and Ameren, we do not have any trades flowing after December 1, 2001 with the other counterparties.  I have not been including counterparties on the list if we don't have any deals flowing December 2001 on out.  If I need to include companies that we don't have outstanding trades with let me know.

Niagara Mohawk has been purchased by Select Energy New York, Inc.  Tonight Global Counterparty is going to replace the Niagara Mohawk name with Select Energy New York, Inc.  I have been waiting on global before adding Select to the termination list.  I have not heard back on Ameren yet.

Once I have an answer from David on the other terminations (by alternate source) I will let you know.

Thanks for organizing the information from all of the e-mails.

Let me know if you need anything else.  I will be sending an updated physical power termination list today.

Thanks,
Melissa

Just to make sure you know, the Power Physical Terminated Transactions spreadsheet, is put together by Melissa from information she has received from Master Log and other.  This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades.

The Bayou City Dance Company is once again selling poinsettias as a fundraiser.  This is the dance company for 10-18 year olds for which my wife, April, is the Director.  They are selling the poinsettias for $8.50 each and they are pretty good size (about 12-18 inches tall from what I remember).  Just like last year, I will deliver the flowers to the Enron building (or at least to the Enron garage).

They come in red, white, or pink, but I think the red were by far the healthiest and longest lasting.

The order are due by next Friday, so please let me know if you would like to order (and how many).

Thanks.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Stacey,

In talking with the Estate team, it sounds like they will be needing a few different types of info to help in the unwinding process.  In addition to the MTM reports you guys have been putting together, could we also do a delta position report by month?

Also, it would be helpful to get a list of deal specs and terms for each counterparty, basically like we were working on for David Forster before the bankruptcy.  I'll check with Kim Theriot on this as she was putting the list together before, but we will also want to get a MTM breakdown by deal for each counterparty.

These requests are not super urgent.  Basically I'd like to get the breakdowns sometime in the next week or two.  Hope that is OK, as I know you guys are inundated with requests at this time.

Let me know if you have any questions or if this overlaps with any other requests.

Thanks.

To:	Kitchen, Louise; White, Stacey W.; Webb, Jay
Cc:	Lavorato, John
Subject:	RE: Interest Rates

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

	Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 and 10:00AM 2/5/2002.

	UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002.

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,


Norman.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

What do you guys think about this.....assuming we can put a fix in port calc that will allow us to true-up the current day (correctly), we could simply recalc the books the following morning (after last day of month) after indeces have been posted, then adjust the financial numbers in the vlookup according to the new top pages?!

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.

Stacey, the index option is showing just as a physical deal with a position. I am wondering if this is creating positions in Risk Trac because our peak position does not tie with the bench mark. The difference is close to the index option but not quite.

Subject:	RE: New Curves - REVISED AGAIN

Hi Frank.

Rakesh and I talked with Narshima Mistra, ancillary trader at EES.  The ancillary curve exists almost every power curve and it's more related to the capacity availability rather than market prices. Obviously it's indirectly related to prices since cost of generation, which is one important factor of constraints in the capacity of generation.  So EES has a table of ancillary service price % to generation cost.(Below)  I think this table can be used to simulate the ancillary prices by mapping to regional curves after the modification based on the market prices.  The problem is the illiquidity of this market. The price is reported once in a month as average point, so the RAC should identify the risk in this market, e.g. is it reasonable to get the daily value at risk.  Once again, as long as the daily prices of the ancillary is given, the implementation will be available by doing analysis on the data and making table like below to use in mapping curves.

Jaesoo

Frank,
the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently.
Using jumps would be appropriate for them.

How urgent is it to start calculating VAR on them?

All,  This past weekend, additional performance related changes to the EnPower production environment were implemented.

Our database environment was upgraded from a 32-bit version of Oracle 8.1.7.2 to the 64-bit version.  This upgrade increases the maximum size of memory cache available to our applications from 4Gb to 25Gb.  Apps that cache large amounts of data will experience reductions in physical I/O thereby increasing application speed.

Once again, this change represents one of many short-term steps to improve the performance of our core wholesale trading system.  I'll continue to send out notifications as these changes are implemented.

We will review the complete set of short and long-term performance related improvements in an upcoming architecture review meeting TBA. 

Glad to discuss.

I am currently working on termination statuses and when deals will be killed etc.  I am also working on a way to get the PCS cleaned up.  Continue to run the calc with the true-up flag off as this will cause more confusion than it is worth.

Subject:	11/30 and 12/3 DPR - update as of 12/15/01

For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, & VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by the middle of next week.

The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to position reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.  I expect the issue to be resolved by the middle of the afternoon today and we will report shortly thereafter.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandhill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suffice as a reason to  unwind this.

Dear Everyone:

  As some of you might have heard, I gave my one-week notification last Friday, my last day with Enron will be Thursday, 1/31.  The reason of my leaving is purely visa status, I have nothing but joy working with you all in the last one and half years,  the wonderful experience made the departure a painful decision.

  I shall be around in the next few days should you need anything from me.  I'd like to thank you all for making my work at Enron such a thrill experience, for your support and friendship, I hope I will have a chance and honor to work with you again in the future.

  Good luck to all of us!

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Regards,

Wei

I would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system.  We will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send Duong Luu their logins and request the 'Zero Volumes' application in EnPower.  There are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great.  I think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we, along with Unify users, will come up with a plan.  I hope to use the schedulers in this process as well, let me know your thoughts.

Subject:	Filling vacancies and adding head count

After my recent budgeting experience, I think we need to tighten up our procedures around filling vacancies and adding head count.

When filling vacancies, I would like to have each of you review the positions.  I think we need to challenge ourselves and the managers
to be as conservative as possible.  I would like to sign off on all replacements.  I promise not to be difficult.

When adding personnel over your current budgeted number, besides having the commercial team sign-off on the addition, I am think
that it may have to be approved by the COO of Americas (Louise).  I am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail
how to keep her in the loop in new hires resulting from business changes (asset management deals or service arrangements)

Let me know what you think.

thanks

bob

Stacey,

Let me know if this is what you are looking for.


Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date.

"RE: update on a couple of things","Sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews.  

I have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC.  I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training.  I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in Houston.  I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget.

I have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing.  If you don't mind, ask Tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing.

Subject:	update on a couple of things

Just wanted to give you an FYI on a couple of things. I am planning to meet with everybody on a one on one basis in the next week to do a quarterly review. I was planning to revisit their mid year reviews and talk about how they have progressed or not, projects they have worked on and how they went,  long term plans, etc. I think it is even more pressing for Heather because of the way the Renewables was handled. I figured since I went through the process with Emissions, I had a pretty good insight on what I wanted her to do, so I laid out the groundwork for her. Didn't go as I had planned so I wanted to use the opportunity to get her back on track.


Regarding coming to Houston a little more often, I would like to try and come maybe every 4 - 6 weeks if that doesn't blow your budget up. Obviously it depends on ticket prices, but I am learning that while it is ok to communicate over the phone with various groups, it doesn't beat being face to face and looking at the same reports and interacting a little more efficiently. As I said, I was only in the office for 2 days but I could have spent a week there getting work done and meeting with people. It would also give me a chance to meet with Jill Vogelfang a little more. I met with her, last Thursday and it was a good meeting.

By the way, have you heard any more about the PC video conferencing?

1. The Mid Market Originations are calculated based on the total QTD P&L
of our certain books mutplied by certain percentages (different by book)
agreed upon by Tim Belden and Chris Foster early this year.  Therefore
essentially the $14.9 MM P&L is calculated based on every deal in our
LTSW, LTNW, LTCA, LTWMGMT, STSW, STNW, and STCA books.  Please let me
know if you need the agreed percentages for each book.

2. Please advise where you saw the $7.5 MM bank and legal expenses.

Originations
(Foster).  Does this relate to a specific deal or several small deals?
2.  We noted that $7.5 million direct expenses related to trading

legal and bank fees.  What do these expenses relate to?

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  As earnings

I have moved deals where Houston has the master to an Alberta ENA terminations book (the postid is 15872 for Jan 10th.  Counterparties in the book are BP, Coral, ElPaso, Maclaren, Mirant, and ECC.

Subject:	Power Month End Procedures


In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Thanks,  David Poston

Subject:	RE: EPMI List of Non-terminated parties: East Power
Importance:	High

The attachment reflects updates reviewed this afternoon arising out of additional credit war room files. Please note that the following counterparties should now be considered to have terminated their wholesale power enabling agreements with EPMI, and performance under any transactions with such parties, if any, should cease: 

AES New Energy, 
Cargill Alliant LLC, 
CP&L, 
OG&E, and 
Southern Illinois Power Cooperative.    

Rainbow and Split Rock have indicated that it was not their intention under their previous correspondence to have terminated, though EPMI may ultimately contest this (no right to partial termination).

Please contact me with any questions, or additional information you may obtain.  David Portz (ext 39239)

Andrew-

I have created a draft of our RisktRAC book setup spreadsheet for East Power.  Can you take a look at it and see if everything is accurate.  One issue I have relates to the 'Trading Location' field.  We had previously used 'US Power East', but this is not part of the dropdown menu in the field.  Has this location been changed to something else?

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

thanks

JDS

We need to try and get this populated today and distributed.  Can each of you please take a look at the assigned section and let me know your comments.  The only thing we are trying to do here is identify the activities of the Estate and what needs to be performed by the resources in each group.

Cara & Mike will you please update the scheduling and trading areas? 

Stacey, will you please update the risk area?

I will work on the settlements / volume Management and I will work with Dave Steiner on the IT section.

Thanks so much for everyone's help.  I'm sorry I'm out of the office today.  We really need to get this done ASAP to help management understand who is available to assist in this time of transition.

Tom,

After our call today Mike Purcell and I spent a little time talking.  We also have some time schedule to Cara and Jeff Richter tomorrow  I have put together the attached  template which I will hopefully have filled out for you by tomorrow afternoon.

Our biggest concern today was how we would address the Real-Time scheduling requirements.  Mark Guzman is part of the estate and should be able to cover the day shift during the week and we can outsource to UBS to cover all the other shifts (Just a proposal).  In addition, Lester Rawson is part of the estate and has Real-Time experience and is also the individual who currently manages the El Paso obligations.

If you have any questions please give me a call @ 503-702-9846.

I just wanted to keep you posted on the information that I know so far about the move.  Of course, it could change with in the next five minutes so it's not written in stone.  

As of now, the move for the  6 th floor is scheduled for Friday (2/8).  Not exactly sure what time this is going to take place yet.  Please make sure that everyone is packed and ready by early Friday morning..  If there is someone out on Friday, please make sure they pack before they leave or you have someone pack their stuff for them.  Please make sure that everyone cleans out their desk completely.  I know that boxes are hard to find right now.  If any of you know that you will need quite a few boxes for your groups, please let me know ASAP so I can have them delivered by Thursday .  I know that there are some boxes on floor 4 in the South building, so you might want to just go grab some.  Labels hopefully will be here Friday morning.  Once I get them I will immediately pass them out.  I have attached the floor plan for the 6 th floor for those of you that want to know where your groups are going (if you don't know already) .  Plus you might want to show it to your groups so they know where to report to on Monday morning.  

If you have any other questions please let me know.  I will update you as soon as I find out more or if there are any changes to this schedule.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.

I believe Jeff cannot make the meeting tomorrow at 9:30 local. I know we meet at 8:30 local should we have jeff and Scott sit in at 8:30 and just meet separately after? Did you want Donnie at the meeting? Of course I am speculating not knowing anything about whether Scott can make it or not.

United Illuminating has terminated as well but we are researching which trades are terminated.  I will let you know once the research is finished.  I spoke to David Portz about the other counterparties listed below.  He said they are all terminated and we should be notified on the next list we receive from legal.

Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Subject:	RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)


The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.

Tom,

For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select ""commodity"" only as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as they are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should query by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (region codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not energy positions, per se:

10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.

Stacey, I believe the below email comes from AA.  I would like to run through you my planned answers to them.  Please review and let me know if it's appropriate.  (John is in Houston for training and I am not sure if he will check email today)

1. The Mid Market Originations are calculated based on the total QTD P&L of our certain books mutplied by certain percentages (different by book) agreed upon by Tim Belden and Chris Foster early this year.  Therefore essentially the $14.9 MM P&L is calculated based on every deals in our LTSW, LTNW, LTCA, LTWMGMT, STSW, STNW, and STCA books.  Please let me know if you need the agreed percentages for each book.

2. Please advise where you saw the $7.5 MM bank and legal expenses.  (Stacey, I am thinking maybe accounting will hold the answer for this question?)

2.  We noted that $7.5 million direct expenses related to trading (Belden)-

They were going to let them know they had a position with the estate and leave it up to them as to whether or not they wanted to come in over the next few days.  Tim wasn't exactly sure the reporting relationship and/or what they would be doing, but felt that everyone would have a role at least in the short-term.

"RE: Dec and Jan liquidations","Tim,

John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

David Oliver - UK-CRD-BRN-PRC - Mark said this one would be officialized.  It showed up as not officialized this am.
Sheri - the exotic price still isn't being officialized.  Where do we stand on that one?
Matt - steel & lumber - they showed up - we rolled the files from yesterday and uploaded them this morning - is this okay or were there terminations run through?

"RE: Liquidations","The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?

What is your status on liquidations? I noticed that you are looking at the fin liq report, etc. Are you running the Max Exp and liq rec even though the liquidations for Dec are not final? 

Stacey, should we have also set up the Orig trading book? Should we have included that in the book requests?

"RE: volatility","The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  

	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.

	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.

	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.

	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.

Hi Hai:

  Here's the logic about volatility.  Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility.  From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option.    The implication of that is that for 

1. other portfolios,
2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now),
3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined,

the blend approach will still be applied.  Please let us know if you have any concerns.

Subject:	Power Month End Procedures


In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

2)  With the luxury of no history and a fresh start, what would you do differently?  Please be specific, and again your suggestions can relate to your area of responsibility or may be broader.  

3)  If you could change or enhance one thing about the operating systems that you use to do your job, what would that be?  Please be specific and constructive on this.  An answer of ""Unify"" for instance, will be too broad.

AES New Energy, 
Cargill Alliant LLC,

Rainbow and Split Rock have indicated that it was not their intention under their previous correspondence to have terminated, though EPMI may ultimately contest this (no right to partial termination).

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a ""?"" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is ""wait 60 days on PX""...""annuity 4 sale back to them"".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
Tracy

The first question is, as of the relevant dates (November 29, December 2,
December 11, and for completeness, all intervening dates) did Sequoia,
Cherokee or EFP have assets other than Enron receivables? If so what were
they, down to particular receivables, and what was done with any proceeds
thereof?  For the purpose of this question and the proposed stipulation,
ignore EFP assets that have nothing to do with Sequoia.  If the answer is,
""on November 29 there were receivables in ______ (identify entity) that
resulted in subsequent collections of $_____ (amount) on _____ (date),
where were the proceeds deposited?  If in an Enron account commingled with
other funds, segregation may not apply.  If segregation applies, then the
DIP lenders may or may not need to consent.

Also, please look at the description in the stipulation of information to
be provided and advise if it accurately describes what we have already
delivered.  If not, please advise regarding any discrepancies.

Thanks.

Travis/Martin: can we agree to segregate and hold cash in trust, given the
DIP financing document?

Julia:  do we need approval of the cash committee internally before
executing? The creditors committee?

NOTE: amount at issue here is about $14,000,000.

True to form, Kelley Drye sent the form of stipulation and order last night
and want to submit it today.  Don't worry about the timing request, but I
would like your comments, particularly as to the paragraphs regarding what
we have or will deliver.  As for the segregation paragraph, all we agreed
to segregate were Sequoia assets.  I need to understand what is in the
other entities, if anything, before I tell them to stick it or agree
because we don't care.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.

Hi Stacey,
I work in the fundamentals group in Portland and receive the forward power curves daily via e-mail to import them into our database for our traders here.  I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Maria

Stacey, 

I think the idea of having two books stinks.  We would have to touch every deal every month to move the ""prompt"" long term month into the short term book.  (Ok - we only have five long term deals right now but ...)  Maybe I'm over reacting.  Do you know of any other instances where this is done to account for risks?

I think a better idea would be to continue with one book using one curve - Pushkar's front end and our curve 3+ years.  We keep the Rho & Drift from this book.

The SA traders could then execute trades with Pushkar to hedge our short term exposure.  They could tell us the P/L to report and in theory this would be the offset to

the short term Rho in the power book.

Stacey,

- ALBERTADIR is in the table: Peak = (20,162), Off-peak = (20,588)

- Per your last email, I'll remove RETAILEAST and RETAILWEST.

- For spreadsheets, we currently see the following:
POWER-SS-R3B-PRC
POWER-SS-R3C-PRC
POWER-SS-R1B-PRC
We'll take these from RiskTrac.

- For SouthAmerica positions, we can also take from RiskTrac

- The numbers for EAST and WEST are off because I ran the query at around 11AM. I didn't realize that Adhoc only holds the last calculated numbers, not as of a certain effective date. If we run the query everyday at 7AM, can we be sure we're capturing all of previous day's trading? And none of current day's?

Thanks.

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.

Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

Importance:	High

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Stacey, I have checked the VaR numbers in the DPR against the date specific VaR reports for several days and they tie out. Can you tell me which reports you were looking at.

Any news on running the DPR's? Do you know what happens with unused vacation time?

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.
