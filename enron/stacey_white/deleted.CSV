"affluent: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Enjoy a year's worth of poems, puns, and puzzles in
The Best of an Almanac of Words at Play.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/puzzspec/wordplay.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for February 5 is:

affluent   \AF-loo-unt\   (adjective)
     1 : flowing in abundance
    *2 : having a generously sufficient and typically
increasing supply of material possessions

Example sentence:
     The affluent families of Tropic City head for their
mountain getaways on sultry summer weekends; the less well-
heeled seek respite in the river that flows through town.

Did you know?
     Are you overflowing with possessions? Does the money
flow in? Are your assets fluid? If so, you can consider
yourself ""affluent."" Today's word is really all about ""flow""
-- that is to say, it's based on the Latin word for ""flow,""
which is ""fluere."" (Some other ""fluere"" descendants are
""confluence,"" ""fluctuate,"" ""fluid,"" ""influence,"" ""mellifluous,""
and ""superfluous."") The older use of ""affluent"" refers, both
literally and figuratively, to an abundant flow, as in ""an
affluent fountain"" or ""affluent joy."" In fact, it was probably
the tendency to use ""affluent fortune"" for an abundant flow of
money that led to our using ""affluent"" as a synonym of ""well-
to-do.""

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

"RE: Volume Management","Ok - that was my understanding as well.  I don't believe any communication has gone out re: estate as of yet.  Tim/Chris were holding off on doing offers for the most part until tomorrow.  

I will have a chat with Tim/Chris (right now they are on a conference call) to see if we can get some clarity.

According to Tim, if we could find no other spots for her to stay in Risk, she would be designated as VM and Kit Blair would be taken off the list.  Do you know what communication is being given to 'estate' employees in Portland?

Stacey - 
 
So is Heather staying with Risk or is she going to Volume Management (taking Kit Blair off the list).
 
Thanks!

I have re-confirmed with Power Operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person.
 
I have all of Heather's information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her, if it has not already been communicated.  Also, please let me know the message you are sending to 'estate' employees in Portland.  I would like to communicate the same message to Samantha.
 
If you want to talk to me you can reach me at 281-894-0468 or send me an e-mail.

The people on the list for VM should be: 

Scotty Gilbert 
Eugene Lee 
Donna Sheidun 
Heather Dunton 



Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.  Stacey will let me know by Sunday where Heather sits relative to Risk.

To be totally consistent from the beginning, can you rename either your long term Long Names to not include spaces between 'North' and 'West' and 'South' and 'West'.  The short term books do not have spaces.

Please note the following changes to traders and what books they will be trading (highlighted in red). There are no longer any management trading books for power or gas. Tracy and John, there will only be one trading book for the st-nw trading area. If there are any issues with this please forward questions to Tim Belden. If there is anyone I have missed on the email that needs this info, please forward it on. To expedite the process for all, Tim Belden will be looking after 2 trading books for the time being. There is no time frame for when a change on this will take place.

Here is a list of the remaining Hourly traders for the West trading region.

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.
 
Chris

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

"clochard: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Looking for a new kind of feeding frenzy? Feast on colorful
references in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions.
http://www.m-w.com/book/writref/allusion.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 15 is:

clochard   \kloh-SHAR\   (noun)
     : tramp, vagrant

Example sentence:
     ""He lives on the Pont Neuf, the oldest and most beautiful
bridge in Paris, which has become a secret home to clochards
. . . while closed for extensive repairs."" (Vincent Canby,
_The New York Times_, October 6, 1992)

Did you know?
     Why such a fancy French word for a bum? The truth of the
matter is, nine times out of ten, you will find ""clochard"" used
for not just any bum, but a French bum -- even more particularly,
a Parisian bum. And, sometimes, it's even a certain type of
Parisian bum -- a type that has been romanticized in literature
and is part of the local color. Nevertheless, as ""francais"" as
this word (which comes from the French verb ""clocher,"" meaning
""to limp"") may seem, its regular appearance in English sources
since 1937 makes it an English word, too.

"magnanimous: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Do you want to give your child a head start in school?

http://quinst.com/clk/mogelepgeichimmalt
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 26 is:

magnanimous   \mag-NAN-uh-mus\   (adjective)
     1 : showing or suggesting a lofty and courageous spirit
    *2 : showing or suggesting nobility of feeling and
generosity of mind

Example sentence:
     Jane was magnanimous in victory, saying she'd been lucky to
win and praising her opponent's skill.

Did you know?
     When you see ""anima,"" ""animus,"" or a similar formation in
a word, it's an indicator of something alive, lively, or
spirited. Something ""animated"" is full of life, for example,
and an ""animal"" is a living, breathing thing. The Latin word
""animus"" means ""soul"" or ""spirit."" In ""magnanimous,"" that
""animus"" is joined by the Latin ""magnus,"" meaning ""great.""
Basically meaning ""greatness of spirit,"" ""magnanimity"" is the
opposite of pettiness. A truly magnanimous person can lose
without complaining and win without gloating. Angry disputes
can sometimes be resolved when one side makes a magnanimous
gesture toward another.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

"RE: Counterparty Setup for Estate Integration Test Dry Run - 1/10/2002","Thinking out loud, I think we need one more test for RAC and CAS.  We need to test a heterogeneous portfolio that has both gas and power books.  This way we can test curve shift pnl data, benchmark quantities, etc?
 
Since we know the above ""fields"" may potentially be wrong because of legacy code, this test would for sure let's us know what really is wrong, instead of suspicions.

Everyone,
 
I have attached the preliminary schedule for tomorrow's test of the integration test scripts. For those individuals, who have been identified to participate in the test and are unable to attend at your scheduled time, please send me the name of your substitute as soon as possible. The current schedule allows plenty of time for each step. If the test is ahead of schedule, we may call you in at an earlier time.
 
Thank You,
 
Terry

Subject: RE: PWR WEST AND PWR WEST GAS 12/31/01


Chris:
 
The reason for the variaces is that you are adding up the daily P&L for 12/3, 12/4, and 12/31 and trying to reconciile with MTD P&L as of 12/31.  However, please note that we produced the 12/31 P&L (i.e. west pwrdpr1231) treating 12/31 as the only calc/trading day in Dec 01', meaning that you should no longer be looking at 12/3 and 12/4 P&L and counting them as part of the MTD P&L anymore.
 
In short, our dpr for 12/31 should have the same Daily and MTD P&L.  Therefore, the ""output"" column in the attached spreadsheet is wrong since it's adding up daily P&L for 12/3, 12/4, and 12/31.
 
* I checked the east desk's P&L and believe we all did the same thing, i.e. treating 12/31 as the only trading/calc day in Dec.  You shall observe similar variances in the reconciliation for their dpr for 12/31 as well.
 
Please let me know if you have further questions.
 
Thanks,
 
Fran

My only outstanding question is the ""roll supporting dpr"" request....do they want 85 printouts of each of our rolls that constitute the total dpr amount?!  Keep in mind that this is only East and West power....according to Gossett, they would need to print out approximately 380 roll reports that constitute the total gas amount!?  

Let me know your thoughts!!

Shona - 

A few points/questions on the request:

1.  How detailed do you want the ""rolls supporting DPR information"".....I ask because we have about 40 individual rolls which constitute our DPR info.  Do they just want a print-out from Excel of each of these rolls?!

2.  All PRMA info needs to come from Accounting (Tracy Greene)

3.  What are they classifying as an ""open"" transaction?!  If you let me know how they are differentiating between an ""open"" and an ""active"" transaction, I can possibly have our IT guys run a script to get a number in an efficient manner.

4.  We can get you the number of books and commercial support people

5.  Average number of transactions per day can possibly be obtained from someone in the EOL group (and then simply extrapolated to obtain a number representing our complete population of deals) as EOL constitutes approximately 75% of the power trading activity

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
Casey

The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.

"zenith: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
What's another word for snowball? Watch your vocabulary
snowball with Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/thesaur/thes.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 27 is:

zenith   \ZEE-nuth or ZEH-nuth\   (noun)
     1 : the point of the celestial sphere that is directly
opposite the nadir and vertically above the observer
     2 : the highest point reached in the heavens by a celestial
body
    *3 : culminating point : acme

Example sentence:
     ""Winning a gold medal at the upcoming Olympic games would
be the zenith of my career,"" said the skier in a recent
interview.

Did you know?
     When you reach the zenith, you're at the top, the pinnacle,
the summit, the peak. ""Zenith"" developed from Arabic terms
meaning ""the way over one's head."" As long ago as the 1300s,
English speakers used ""zenith"" to name the highest point in the
celestial heavens, directly overhead. By the 1600s, ""zenith"" was
being used in English for other high points as well.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Subject:	Weird Deal Change Yesterday

Something strange happened in Enpower yesterday.  A deal from the STNW book was changed and we aren't sure why.  It appears that some strips from a $180 sale in NP15 were erased.  Our theory is that something happened between FSP and Enpower that erased these strips.  Of course, we don't know what happened, which is why I am contacting you.  This is really scary if our systems are changing deals.  The only reason that we noticed was because of a huge P&L hit to the STNW book.  If the price of the deal had been closer to current market we wouldn't have noticed.  Please look into this and let the trading team know what happened.

"Poinsettias","The Bayou City Dance Company is once again selling poinsettias as a fundraiser.  This is the dance company for 10-18 year olds for which my wife, April, is the Director.  They are selling the poinsettias for $8.50 each and they are pretty good size (about 12-18 inches tall from what I remember).  Just like last year, I will deliver the flowers to the Enron building (or at least to the Enron garage).

They come in red, white, or pink, but I think the red were by far the healthiest and longest lasting.

The order are due by next Friday, so please let me know if you would like to order (and how many).

Thanks.

I have re-confirmed with Power Operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person.
 
I have all of Heather's information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her, if it has not already been communicated.  Also, please let me know the message you are sending to 'estate' employees in Portland.  I would like to communicate the same message to Samantha.

The people on the list for VM should be: 

Scotty Gilbert 
Eugene Lee 
Donna Sheidun 
Heather Dunton 



Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.  Stacey will let me know by Sunday where Heather sits relative to Risk.

"RE: ENA termination","Thanks
I have moved deals where Houston has the master to an Alberta ENA terminations book (the postid is 15872 for Jan 10th.  Counterparties in the book are BP, Coral, ElPaso, Maclaren, Mirant, and ECC.  (I still need to move the ECC deals).  I think you would need to consider this book anytime you are doing termination calculations for any of these counterparies.

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.

"cognizable: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Want to get published? Here's your chance to get recognized.
Click to learn more! Sponsored by Penguin Putnam Publishing.
http://www.insidesessions.com/promos/promowriting.asp?rid=749
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 26 is:

cognizable   \KAHG-nuh-zuh-bul or kahg-NYE-zuh-bul\   (adjective)
     1 : capable of being known
    *2 : capable of being judicially heard and determined

Example sentence:
     The court determined that the plaintiff's claim of having
received an unfair grade was not a legally cognizable action.

Did you know?
     It's easy to recognize the ""cogni-"" in ""cognizable"" as the
root in other English words that have to do with knowing:
""precognition,"" ""incognito,"" ""recognition,"" and ""cognitive,""
for example. They're all from Latin ""cognoscere"" (""to know"").
""Cognizable"" was formed in the 17th century from the root of
""cognizance,"" which means ""knowledge."" ""Cognizance"" in turn
traces to ""cognoscere"" by way of Middle French ""conoissance.""
""Cognizable"" was used in the legal sense almost from its
introduction, and that's the sense that is far and away the
most common use today.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Just to clarify,

PWRTESTN   points to GBLPARA  (which is a replicated database from GDB production).

PWRDEVN 	points to GBLTEST.

    After talking to our DBA Tantra, we found out that TESTN points to GBL PARA which
    is actually production global data.
    In that case we can not enter test global data in TESTN where we want to test.
    Tantra said that we can use DEVN for global test data, my impression is that we need 
    to use TESTN however

Sorry -- one more request.

I know a few of the Global users have tested this week.  Please provide me an update on the following. 

To all Global users:  If you have tested this week -- have you been sending your test scripts to your Unify users so they can verify the information has been replicated?  Also, give me an update if the scripts were run for Financial, Gas or Power.

To all Unify users:  If you have received test scripts (this week) have you verified the information was replicated?  If so, is it there?

If you are unaware what you are to be testing -- please let me know and I will send you the spreadsheet again.

Regards,
Melissa

UAT (week of 10/22) is mandatory!  Please supply me with the times/dates you are available to test for the next two weeks, as well as the blackout times ASAP.

We are in the process of stress testing the system.  To ensure that we are free of errors and duplicate data -- I need new data to be entered into ""ALL"" scripts this week (preferably Monday thru Wednesday).   I know you are all extremely busy but the data entered prior to noon today cannot be used.  We have resolved a few issues and need new data sent across in order to verify the resolution is complete.

To prepare you in advance -- I will need you to re-run all test scripts again next week.

If you have question, concerns or run into any problems -- please call or email me immediately (x54889).  

Regards,
Melissa
(x54889)


DON'T FORGET:
Ensure that each team is communicating with each other.  The following process must be followed each and every time the test script is executed in order to track test script results:

The Result section of all test scripts must be filled out by the Global Users.  
Global users will email the completed test scripts to their Unify teammate.  
Once the Unify tester has completed verification, he/she will fill in the remainder of the Result information.  
After the Unify tester has verified and updated all test scripts, the Unify testers will forward the test scripts, along with all results to me.  

For example: When Marlene is finished entering all Global Facilities test scripts -> Chris, Wade and Richard should receive an email containing the test scripts and Result information needed for Unify verification (i.e. Pipeline, rate schedule, deal category, etc).  Richard, Wade and Chris will verify Unify information and fill in additional Result information.  Once that is complete -- I should receive 3 emails (one from each person) containing the test scripts and Result information.


Also, remember: you do not have to follow the scripts verbatim.  Under the Script Execution section of each script -- Required Actions are mandatory.  However, you can add additional information if you so choose.  The more information -- the better the test.  On the other hand, the Expected Results column may vary per user.  

NOTE:  The 18th floor testing lab is available for your use.  Please refer to the email I sent out for lab time availability.

Subject:	RE: quick question regarding EOL Administration

John,

Currently, there is no way we can meet this need.  The information we get from EOL does not include a desk id and we must determine the id based on the criteria given below.  

There are two possible solutions
1)  Add one or more other fields as criteria for determining the desk.
2)  Have EOL send the desk id in the bridge message.

Although I cannot speak for EOL IT, I suspect that solution 2 would be very involved.  I doubt that traders are even able to select a desk when creating a product in EOL.  Melba, can you verify this fact?

If option 1 is doable from a business perspective, we will need to discuss further the changes and timeline involved for IT.  This issues should be raise in the meeting with Steve Nat tomorrow.

Regards,
Will

Will, due to the changing circumstances, the West and Canada have traders using multiple books, multiple regions for phys and Fin. Can we work around this or make a change that would not be too complicated?

Fran,

All deals from EOL are mapped to a desk in EnPower following these rules:

There cannot be more than one desk for any combination of
Trader
Region
Nature (Phys/Fin)

Therefore, you can have a trader with different books, so long as either the Region or Nature is different.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi, Duong Luu and Will:

We are trying to add Tim Belden in EOL Adminstration (under Enpower) to be the Trader of ""NETCO Long Term Southwest"" after I have added him as the trader for ""NETCO Long Term California"",  but I kept getting below error message:

ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_DEAL_DEFAULT_DESKS) violated


Is this because we cannot have any individual to be the trader of more than one west book?

Please advise. 

Thanks,

Fran

Subject:	Curve Marks thru 2/4 (maybe 2/5)

Kevin/Paul -

Apparently the new/separate curve database will not be copied until Monday 2/4.  Therefore, we need to decide who will be responsible for marking curves until such time.

Over the last few days our group has attempted to mark curves but has not been able to because the Netco group is still performing this function (in most cases).  My suggestion is that Netco employees continue to mark curves until the new database is completed.  At that time, there will be two separate processes.  The Enron estate process will only be marking curves where we have live (not terminated) positions including vol positions.

In the meantime, our group will be focusing on validation of the 11/30 and 12/03 curves as well as any other dates that will be crucial for termination calculation purposes.  We will need access to all back-up curve data captured during these time periods.

Please let me know if you agree.

Rogers

Dear All,

	After the Windows Accounts migration tonight, our UBS traders will not be able to access the Estate EnPower Curve Manager. We are going to copy all the existing Curve data and files from the Estate to the UBS servers tonight. This would be the Final copy, so the UBS Curve data is considered Production data.

	Starting tomorrow, please let the Estate Traders mark the Estate Curves, and UBS traders mark the UBS Production curves.

	Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 and 10:00AM 2/5/2002.

	UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002.

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,


Norman.

PS. Kathy, please contact Min if you need help on Alberta's Excel Position Managers ( Curve) files.

""We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  The events of September the 11th left
America sadder and stronger, and they clarified some important goals for
our country.  We have a war to wage and a recession to fight.  Defending
our country and strengthening our economy are great priorities for 2002.
 We must be determined and we must keep our focus.

This Saturday, I'm traveling in Oregon and California, talking with
people who have been hit hard by the economic downturn.  When I return
to Washington on Monday, I will be meeting with my economic advisors and
other officials to discuss the latest economic data and work for a quick
recovery for our economy.

Choosing the Path Home
By Alan Keyes

The afterglow of the Christmas season is a good occasion to recall that
the American family, like the Holy Family leaving Bethlehem, has a long
journey ahead of it.  And there are other reminders for us in the
Christmas story -- some cheerful, and others less so.  Among these are
the families that remained in Bethlehem, grieving over the sacrifice of
innocent children, killed at Herod's command.

This Christmas has been indelibly marked by the events of Sept. 11, and
the ongoing struggle against terrorism.  Yet it is not these evils which
the slaughter of innocents at the first Christmas should most bring to
mind.  A greater grief than international terror afflicts us, because
our children, who are the future of America, remain under savage assault
both within the womb and during their most vulnerable early years.

The Rumsfeld Mystique: Understanding His Popularity
By Carol Devine-Molin

I noticed that the ground was beginning to shift last summer with the
re-emergence of  machismo males, or truly masculine men if you will,
embracing their testosterone-driven  behaviors, and coming back into
style. In a scene reminiscent of the movie ""Jaws"", eight- year old
Jessie Arbogast lost his arm stemming from an attack by a 7-foot bull
shark on  July 6th of last year in Florida. The young victim's uncle,
Vance Flosenzier, was there to  intervene in a spectacular manner at the
onset. In an amazing accomplishment, Flosenzier  proceeded to drag that
dastardly shark, that carnivorous sea beast, to the shore with only  his
bare hands and brute force, for the purpose of extracting the boy's arm
from the  shark's gut. In our collective memory, none of us had ever
heard of such a thing being  done before. And everyone loved it!

And the ""Day of Infamy"" only generated more respect for the intrepid
""manly men"" of  the working class, the firefighters, policemen and
emergency workers who braved life  and limb to rescue those at the World
Trade Center. As President Bush has indicated, the  tragic circumstances
of 9/11 have caused us to re-evaluate our priorities, and to sort out
that which is truly important in life. And, clearly, a dauntless spirit
and selflessness are  not only salient human attributes, but deeply
attractive ones as well.

The Euro Makes All Things Possible
By SARTRE

Euro, Euro, Euro all around, but not a pence of 'real money', to spend.
With these euro notes of this common currency, the wire services heap
praise on its successful launch. The wheels of business and the
mechanism of finance are all in gear to usher in this brave new world of
commerce. For years we have heard the benefits of the first united
coinage since the Roman Empire and the elimination of the chaos of
individual currencies. So what will this conversion mean for Europe and
the rest of the world?

The conclusion largely depends on what you consume from the political
plate and whether you wish to place your thumb on the scale that weighs
the beef. The traditions of Europe are quite different from those of the
original colonies when it comes to a monetary perspective. With the
founding of our Nation, constitutional powers were enumerated regarding
the nature and coinage of money. Individual States were restricted from
their own coinage, while punishment for counterfeiting was established.
Standard weights and measures of gold and silver were defined as legal
tender. So what does this have to do with the modern world and the
financial developments on the continent?

A Good Villain is Hard to Find
By Dorothy Anne Seese

It's just not easy to find a good sustainable villain in our modern
times.

Hitler and Stalin enjoyed a fairly long run on the world's Bijou stage,
but after their days came to an end, Hitler in 1945 and Stalin in 1953,
we really haven't had anyone of their evil ilk in the real world.  To be
sure, Mao Tse Tung got his share of publicity and may have done in more
folks than either Hitler or Stalin, but he had no real persona in the
west.  Fidel Castro has been little more than a familiar name for a
perpetual nuisance who always looks like he needs a bath, de-lousing and
some deodorant.

"omnibus: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Do you want to give your child a head start in school?

http://quinst.com/clk/mogelepgeichimmalt
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 23 is:

omnibus   \AHM-nih-bus\   (adjective)
     1 : of, relating to, or providing for many things at once
    *2 : containing or including many items

Example sentence:
     The state legislature approved an omnibus amendment that
included an array of measures encompassing everything from
education to workplace safety.

Did you know?
     The adjective ""omnibus"" may not have much to do with public
transportation, but the noun ""omnibus"" certainly does -- it not
only means ""bus,"" it's also the word we shorten to form ""bus.""
The noun ""omnibus"" originated in the 1820s as a French word for
long, horse-drawn vehicles that transported people along the
main thoroughfares of Paris. Shortly thereafter, omnibuses --
and the noun ""omnibus"" -- arrived in New York. But in Latin,
""omnibus"" simply means ""for all."" Our adjective ""omnibus,""
which arrived in the mid-1800s, seems to hark back to that
Latin ""omnibus,"" though it may also have been at least
partially influenced by the English noun. An ""omnibus bill""
containing numerous provisions, for example, could be likened
to a bus loaded with people.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 24 is:

ascetic   \uh-SEH-tik\   (adjective)
     1 : practicing strict self-denial as a measure of personal
and especially spiritual discipline
    *2 : austere in appearance, manner, or attitude

Example sentence:
     Ms. Walter's plain, dark clothing and tight bun give her
an ascetic appearance, but she is actually very warm and fun-
loving.

Did you know?
     ""Ascetic"" comes from ""asketikos,"" a Greek adjective meaning
""laborious."" Ultimately, it comes from the Greek verb ""askein,""
which means ""exercise"" or ""work."" There aren't many other English
words from ""askein,"" but there's no dearth of synonyms for
""ascetic."" ""Severe"" and ""austere,"" for example, are two words
that share with ""ascetic"" the basic meaning ""given to or marked
by strict discipline and firm restraint."" ""Ascetic"" implies
abstention from pleasure and comfort or self-indulgence as
spiritual discipline, whereas ""severe"" implies standards enforced
without indulgence or laxity and may suggest harshness (as in
""severe military discipline""). ""Austere"" stresses absence of
warmth, color, or feeling and may apply to rigorous restraint,
simplicity, or self-denial (as in ""living an austere life in the
country"").

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Subject:	R20 - Ontario

Garrett,
Recognizing that Ontario does not open until Mar 02, and recognizing that we have positions starting then, and recognizing that the curve doesn't have prices posted for reference dates prior to Mar 02, the value-at-risk engine is getting errors in it's simulations due to lack of prices thereof.  

Can you do either of the below?
?	Post prices for dates up to Mar 02?  (realize their isn't market?.tough issue)
o	If you post a price, I'm not sure it will mean much other than letting VAR run, primarily because there isn't position prior to Mar 02. Perhaps you can fill in hole with a realistic price so prompt month correlations don't go wacko?I guess.. Stacey help. 
?	Recommend a ""like"" curve to map R20 to so that we can get around zero price issues?  Realize that mapping will include entire term structure and not just for the reference dates with zero price.
?	Other ideas?

I appreciate your help in working toward a solution.

Thanks,
Frank

Hi, Andrea.

We can give the expanded access once the new NETCO version of the RMS database is up and running.

We are working on the new database as we speak.  Once it's up and running we will grant the access.

If you need anything else in the meantime please contact myself or Susan Trevino, thanks!

"RE: EPMI List Non terminated parties","1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.

I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.

"RE: Enpower positions","Tom,

The only active spreadsheet we have right now in the East is POWER-SS-R1B-PRC.  The POWER-SS-R3B-PRC will be zeroed out tomorrow....the option actually ended in August, but the spreadsheet was never zeroed out and re-entered into RiskTrac, so that last day's position is still sitting in RiskTrac.  

The time frame between 7 and 11 a.m. in AdHoc is irrelevant because once we calc in the afternoon (which ""writes"" daily info to AdHoc), the AdHoc table should not change until we calc the following afternoon.  You can be sure that you will only capture the previous day's historical data unless IT is doing some sort of testing and it utilizing AdHoc.  This happens very rarely but when it does, we will make sure to keep you in the loop.

Let me know if you have further questions!
Thanks!
Casey

Stacey,

- ALBERTADIR is in the table: Peak = (20,162), Off-peak = (20,588)

- Per your last email, I'll remove RETAILEAST and RETAILWEST.

- For spreadsheets, we currently see the following:
POWER-SS-R3B-PRC
POWER-SS-R3C-PRC
POWER-SS-R1B-PRC
We'll take these from RiskTrac.

- For SouthAmerica positions, we can also take from RiskTrac

- The numbers for EAST and WEST are off because I ran the query at around 11AM. I didn't realize that Adhoc only holds the last calculated numbers, not as of a certain effective date. If we run the query everyday at 7AM, can we be sure we're capturing all of previous day's trading? And none of current day's?

Thanks.
-Tom

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.

In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was  busily working when a new voice came over the intercom asking for a carry out at  check register 4. Kurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air,  and decided to answer the call. As he approached the check-out stand a  distantsmile caught his eye, the new  check out girl was beautiful. She was an older woman (maybe 26, and he was only  22) and he immediately fell in love.
 
Later that day, after his shift was over, he  waited by the punch out clock to find out her name. She came into the break room  and smiled softly at him and took her card and punched out and left. He looked  at her card - BRENDA. He walked out only to see her start walking up the  road.
 
The next day, he waited outside as she left  the supermarket, and offered her a ride home. He looked harmless enough, and she  accepted. When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her again,  outside of work. She simply said it wasn't possible. He pressed and then she  explained she had two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter. So he  offered to pay for the baby-sitter. She reluctantly accepted his offer for a  date for the following Saturday.
 
That Saturday night he arrived at her door  only to have her tell him that she was unable to go out with him. The  baby-sitter had called and canceled. To which Kurtis simply said, ""Well,  lets take the kids with us.""
 
She tried to explain that taking the children  was not an option, but again not taking no for an answer, he pressed. Finally  Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children. She had an older daughter who  was very cute, Kurtis thought. Then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair.  He was born a paraplegic with Down's syndrome. Kurtis asked Brenda, ""I  still don't understand why the kids can't come with us?""
 
Brenda was amazed. Most men would run away  from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities. Just like her  first husband and father of the children did.
 
That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the  kids, went to dinner and the movies. When her son needed anything Kurtis would  take care of him. When he needed to use the restroom, he picked him up out of  his wheel-chair and took him. The kids loved Kurtis. At the end of the evening,  Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her  life with.
 
A year later, they were married and Kurtis  adopted both of her children and since then have added two more children to the  family.
 
So what happened to the stock boy and the  check out girl? Well, Mr. And Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he  is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays  quarterback.

she considers the term to be an epithet and it makes her
hopping mad.

Did you know?
     Nowadays, ""epithet"" is usually used negatively, with the
meaning ""a derogatory word or phrase,"" but it wasn't always
that way. ""Epithet"" comes to us via Latin from the Greek noun
""epitheton"" and ultimately derives from ""epitithenai,"" meaning
""to put on, add."" In its oldest sense, an ""epithet"" is simply a
descriptive word or phrase, especially one joined by fixed
association to the name of someone or something (as in ""Peter
the Great"" or the stock Homeric phrases ""gray-eyed Athena"" and
""wine-dark sea""). Alternatively, epithets may be used in place
of a name (as in ""the Peacemaker"" or ""the Eternal""). These
neutral meanings of ""epithet"" are still in use, but today the
word is more often used in its negative ""term of disparagement""
sense.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

I can easily put in prices for the earlier months.  My only worry is that it may affect EES since they have current Ontario positions that should not be valued against my curve (they should use regulated rates until market opening).

I can put the prices in today.

Garrett,
Recognizing that Ontario does not open until Mar 02, and recognizing that we have positions starting then, and recognizing that the curve doesn't have prices posted for reference dates prior to Mar 02, the value-at-risk engine is getting errors in it's simulations due to lack of prices thereof.  

Can you do either of the below?
?	Post prices for dates up to Mar 02?  (realize their isn't market?.tough issue)
o	If you post a price, I'm not sure it will mean much other than letting VAR run, primarily because there isn't position prior to Mar 02. Perhaps you can fill in hole with a realistic price so prompt month correlations don't go wacko?I guess.. Stacey help. 
?	Recommend a ""like"" curve to map R20 to so that we can get around zero price issues?  Realize that mapping will include entire term structure and not just for the reference dates with zero price.
?	Other ideas?

I appreciate your help in working toward a solution.

Thanks,
Frank

16:59 10Jan2002 RSF-WRAPUP 1-Enron called Bush Cabinet officers before bankruptcy

    By Arshad Mohammed
    WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The collapse of Enron Corp. <ENE.N> entangled the Bush administration on Thursday as the White House said two Cabinet officers were warned of its looming bankruptcy and Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the criminal investigation into the company.
    Trying to inoculate himself from the political fallout, President George W. Bush ordered a review headed by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules to avoid a repeat of the energy trading firm's collapse, in which thousands of employees lost their pension savings.
    In a series of stunning disclosures that followed Wednesday's announcement of a criminal probe into Enron, the energy firm's auditor, Andersen, said its employees had destroyed documents related to the former energy giant's balance sheet.
    Bush's team has close ties to Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a major Bush campaign contributor who last autumn called O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Bush's 2000 campaign manager, to warn them of the impending bankruptcy.
    The White House said O'Neill and Evans opted to do nothing about Lay's calls, which appeared to hint at the possibility of a private bailout like the one orchestrated by the New York Federal Reserve in 1998 for hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.
    A senior U.S. official, however, said that Lay ""did not ask for anything"" in the telephone calls.
    The Justice Department on Wednesday announced it had opened a criminal investigation into the energy trading company, whose December bankruptcy threw thousands out of work, devastated investors and wiped out the pension plans of many employees when its stock price plunged.
    Ashcroft removed himself from the investigation, which is expected to focus on whether the firm misled investors about its accounts, because Enron gave him political contributions for his run for a U.S. Senate in his home state of Missouri.
    DOCUMENTS DESTROYED
    Anderson, the Big Five accounting firm that served as the company's auditor, on Thursday said its employees had deleted documents related to its review of the company's finances and congressional sources said thousands were destroyed.
    Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who has already been seeking information about contacts between the White House and Enron, questioned whether the Bush administration could have done more to help the company and its employees.
    ""The White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings,"" he said in a statement. ""I am deeply troubled that the White House stood by and let this happen to thousands of families.""
    Bush, who worked in the oil industry and has known Enron's chairman since he was governor of Texas, appeared to distance himself from Lay, saying he never discussed Enron's financial difficulties with him and last met the executive last spring.
    ""I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,"" Bush said, adding that the last time he had seen Lay was last spring at a literacy fund-raising event organized by his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush.
    PHONE CALLS
    White House House spokesman Ari Fleischer disclosed on Thursday that Lay telephoned O'Neill and Evans last autumn saying his company might not be able to meet its obligations.
    Fleischer said Lay suggested the possibility of using the case of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund which benefited from a private bailout orchestrated by the New York Federal Reserve in September 1998, as model for his company.
    After studying the matter and concluding that Enron's problems would not have the kind of systemic effects on the economy that were feared in LTCM's case, O'Neill and Evans decided against taking any action.
    ""They both agreed no action should be taken to intervene,"" Fleischer said, adding that Bush was not informed of the decision but believes O'Neill and Evans acted ""wisely.""
    At his daily briefing, the spokesman fended off questions about why Bush was not informed of the decision, the propriety and timing of Enron contacting top government officials about its problems, and whether Evans and O'Neill acted properly.
    ""Communication is not a wrong-doing. What took place here was they received phone calls and took no action,"" Fleischer said. ""The charge has been did the government take any action, and the answer from these two officials is no.""
    Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay called O'Neill on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8  -- after Enron's key Oct. 16 disclosure that it was taking huge charges related to its partnerships, which provided the first hint of its spectacular unraveling.
    Speaking to reporters after meeting with economic advisers on Thursday, Bush placed the emphasis on workers and investors who suffered as a result of Enron's troubles and ordered two reviews to recommend how to better protect them in the future.
    He said the first review, by the Treasury, Commerce and Labor departments, would analyze pension and 401(k) rules and recommend ways to reform them so that ""people are not exposed to losing their life savings as a result of a bankruptcy.""
    The review of disclosure rules would be conducted by the Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
    Once the world's largest energy trader, Enron slid in mere weeks last year from Wall Street stardom to the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Its downfall, after withdrawal of a rescue takeover bid by rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N>, threw thousands out of work and hammered investors.
    The episode sapped the life savings of many Enron employees who held large amounts of company stock in their 401(k) retirement plans, while top executives allegedly pocketed fat profits by selling before a plunge in Enron's share price.
    ""I have great concerns for ... (those) who put their life savings aside and, for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regulation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy and have lost life savings,"" Bush told reporters at the White House, saying the groups would take a ""good hard look"" at the matter.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 31 is:

Rosetta stone   \roh-ZEH-tuh-stohn\   (noun)
      1 : a black basalt stone found in 1799 that bears an
inscription in hieroglyphics, demotic characters, and Greek and
is celebrated for having given the first clue to the decipherment
of Egyptian hieroglyphics
     *2 : one that gives a clue to understanding

Example sentence:
     ""There is no reason patients shouldn't be able to understand
the prescriptions they are given without a Rosetta stone."" (Joe
Graedon, et al, _The Springfield [Mass.] Union-News_, March 2,
1990)

Did you know?
     We still use the word ""hieroglyphics"" for something difficult
to decipher, but 200 years ago, the term was more literal -- it
referred to an Egyptian writing system that was utterly
unintelligible to modern man. So when an inscribed stone about the
size of a coffee table was discovered in an Egyptian town called
""Rosetta"" (""Rashid"" in Arabic), it changed the course of language
history. The Rosetta stone, as it came to be called, held a key.
Probably written by Egyptian priests in the 2nd century B.C., its

Hi Stacey!
I wanted to thank you for spending time with me yesterday.
I am very interested in learning more about/ pursuing opportunities within your group.
Since i would have to pretty much start from scratch, wherever you have a need i would be glad to jump in.
Both the curve validation & risk positions sound very interesting to me.
Below is my availablilty over the next 2 weeks...
Please let me know who you'd like for me to sit with/ learn from/ etc. and i will be there.
 
Friday, 10/19- OFF
Monday, 10/22- available all day
Tuesday, 10/23- not available
Wednesday, 10/24- available after 9:30
Thursday & Friday, 10/24-5- available all day
Monday & Tuesday, 10/29-30- available all day
 
I will be off the 31st through the 2nd, as we are now moving (as of 4:30 yesterday!) to the green glass building behind my current unit.
We got a great deal, and saved a bunch of $$$$, so i took it.
 
Let me know what works for you...
 
Thanks!
 
Sunjay

stacey,

As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandhill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suffice as a reason to  unwind this.

Please let me know,

I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.

Trust you are well.

"RE: ENA termination","Stacey,
Yes, these numbers are in C$ but I think I can get a calc to work in US$.  I calc'd a book 15900.  The deal summary report looks right but adhoc doesn't - I think becuase I am still in the middle of changing deals and it didn't like the duplucate deals.  I'll test again with tonight's calc.  But if I get it to work you should be able to get US$ MTM numbers straight from the calc, without any additional conversion required.  Note though that the liquidations (in both the DPR automation - Schedule A and any liquidation reports will still by in C$).

I have moved deals where Houston has the master to an Alberta ENA terminations book (the postid is 15872 for Jan 10th.  Counterparties in the book are BP, Coral, ElPaso, Maclaren, Mirant, and ECC.  (I still need to move the ECC deals).  I think you would need to consider this book anytime you are doing termination calculations for any of these counterparies.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

2002 YEAR-END VACATION CARRYOVER GUIDELINES


I will be sending to you today hard copies of the vacation carry-over report for your business unit. Please verify the accuracy of the 40 hours carry-over and sign the bottom of the page.  Additionally, if you have employees, who for business reason, need to carry-over more than 40 hours, please do the following:

?	Place the total number of hours over the 40 hours carry-over in the column entitled ""additional carry-over amount approved"" 
?	Initial and provide business rationale. If there is not enough space on the report, please provide your rationale under separate cover. 
Please sign and date at the bottom of each sheet. 


Approval for carryover in excess of 40 hours will need the approval of the Creditors Committee and Executive HR. 
Please complete and return sheets to me  by January 22, 2002. The endorsed exceptions will be reviewed by the Bankruptcy Committee and Human Resources leadership from January 25-29, 2002. We hope to post and reflect all approved carry-over vacation by January 31, 2002. Please call if you have any questions. I appreciate your support in this process.

"Enpower Outage Notice ***THIS WEEKEND***","Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

I have a lunch meeting for DHA on Thursday that I committed to be at (and have a report to give).  I definitely do not want to cause problems by not being at this staff meeting that was called for Thursday though.  Would you like me to find someone to take my place at the DHA meeting?

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

When you look back over the past few weeks, you realized that a tremendous amount of work was done and it resulted in only a few minor issues during today' s integration test. Everyone involved should give himself or herself a well-deserved pat on the back.
 
Thank You!
 
During the upcoming week, the integration test team will be concentrating on resolving any outstanding issues for Estate and completing the Netco integration tests. For the most part, we will use the same test scripts used for Estate; the major differences are EOL and SAP. The plan is to complete the testing by end of day on Friday, January 18th. 
 
Problem resolution Monday - Wednesday - procedure

Contact the Bridgeline 800-711-8000 (Code #3454709) from 7am - 7pm.  This will be the most effective of tracking, dispatching to the application representatives.  The integration test team will be monitoring and have access to the escalation procedures.

For those individuals who work in Unify, please remember to logoff and log back into Windows prior to accessing Unify. Please pass this information on to your co-workers. 
 
Just a reminder, for those individuals who participated in the testing, please clean up (zero out, un-officialize, etc.), do not kill the deal, any deals created during the testing for Sitara, TAGG, EnPower, Unify PM, Unify VM, Unify Settlements, CAS and ?????:

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 23 is:

modicum   \MAH-dih-kum or MOE-dih-kum\   (noun)
     : a small portion : a limited quantity

Example sentence:
     Anyone with a modicum of sense will pause to think before
making a major decision.

Did you know?
     What does ""modicum"" have to do with a toilet? It just so
happens that ""modicum"" shares the same Latin parent as ""commode,""
which is a synonym of ""toilet."" ""Modicum"" and ""commode""
ultimately derive from the Latin noun ""modus,"" which means
""measure."" ""Modicum"" has been a part of the English language
since the 15th century. It descends from the Latin ""modicus""
(""moderate""), which is itself a descendant of ""modus."" (Logically
enough, ""modicum"" refers to a small ""measure"" of something.)
""Modus"" really measures up as a Latin root -- it also gave us
""mode"" (originally a kind of musical ""measure""), ""modal,""
""model,"" ""modern,"" ""modify,"" and ""modulate."" More distant
relatives include ""mete,"" ""moderate,"" and ""modest.""

GOPUSA Latest News

In today's issue of the Eagle, we bring you several reports regarding
Enron.

First, GOPUSA has obtained a copy of the ""Carville memo"" which was first
reported on Fox News last week.  Now available online, GOPUSA analyzes
this memo, and shows how this is simply a desperate attempt by Democrat
operatives to make a scandal where none exists.

Next, GOPUSA gives you information on Enron and the Democrats as
reported by Bob Webster, the editor of OpinioNet.com.  Finally, you'll
get the perspective from one of our most popular GOPUSA columnists,
Carol Devine-Molin.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. In my State of the Union address, I
committed our nation to three great goals: To win the war, to secure our
homeland, and to defeat the recession.

In recent days, we have heard some encouraging reports on our progress
and our work to defeat the recession. But many workers have lost their
jobs and their retirement savings when their companies went bankrupt.
Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have
to risk losing everything if their company fails. So my administration
is proposing important safeguards to our pension laws to protect the
retirement savings of workers.

Carville's 'Enron' Memo Seeks Scandal, but American People Disagree
By Eric Sloan and Bobby Eberle

On January 28th of this year, one day before President Bush's State of
the Union speech, Democracy Corps, a group led by James Carville, Stan
Greenberg, and Bob Shrum, issued a memorandum to its ''friends'' as a
preemptive strike to thwart Bush's increasing popularity.  Their weapon?
Enron.

The memo, simplistically entitled ''Enron,'' is represented as the
collective analytical work of Carville, Greenberg, and Shrum.  The
memo's goal is clear: ''Enron has the potential to shape the entire
political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce
confidence in the Bush Administration and Republicans.''  The survey,
however, tells a much different story than the Democracy Corps analysis
suggests.

Enron Offers Smear Opportunity to Partisan Liberal Democrats
By Bob Webster

The collapse of Enron presents partisan liberal Democrats with a
deliciously tempting opportunity to smear the Bush-Cheney
administration. After all, Bush was governor of Texas, Cheney recently
lived in Texas, both Bush and Cheney have had business ties to the Texas
energy industry, and Enron was a Texas energy company. What better
scenario for casting aspersions in a fishing expedition in search of
official misconduct?

This ""too good to be true"" scenario was pounced on by David Callaway,
executive editor of CBS.MarketWatch.com in a smarmy little bit of
wishful thinking titled: Enron is not Bush's Whitewater - It will be
worse.

Enron's Corrupt Corporate Culture: A Call For Justice
By Carol Devine-Molin

Amid significant controversy and emerging ire, the bankruptcy of
corporate giant Enron is now resounding throughout this nation.

Enron's top management, in conjunction with their auditing firm Arthur
Anderson, conspired to commit fraudulent activities by systematically
hiding their company's losses and declining profitability. In effect,
Enron's stock prices were bolstered through deceptive machinations, a
notable affront to our free market arena and capitalism. Apparently,
""creative bookkeeping"" and byzantine methods were utilized by an
ostensibly reputable auditing firm, Arthur Anderson, on behalf of their
client, Enron.

What a Difference a Year Makes
By Gregg Bish

What a difference a day (or a year) makes.

Just a year ago, during the first days of his administration, the newly
sworn President Bush was being roasted as ""illegitimate"", ""incapable"",
""verbally challenged"", and a host of other epithets pointedly suggesting
that President Bush lacked the ""gravitas"" to be a president -- OR a
governor, for that matter.

Patriot Act Another RICO?
By SARTRE

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act of 1970
and the Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001 may go down in the record books as two
of the most notorious laws in U.S. History.  Both were passed by
Congress in order to address the perceived nationwide crises of their
respective times -- the former in an effort to crack down on organized
crime and the latter in an attempt to protect America from the threat of
terrorism.  But are these laws solving our immediate problems or simply
creating new ones?

American Culture: Its Rise and Demise
By Dorothy Anne Seese

The American culture as it was known through the early 1960's was based
on the rule of law, governed by the Constitution, protected by the Bill
of Rights, based on concepts of Judeo-Christian morality and individual
freedom and responsibility. It had defects -- forced segregation based
on race, skin color or national origin was a huge defect. The
desegregation effort was mishandled and its outcome has been
unfortunate, because now we have much reverse segregation and the total
dilution of American culture.

Republicans Should Not Trust Lucy, or the Liberal Press
By Theron Johnson

Remember the old conflict between Lucy and Charlie Brown on the football
field? She would always promise to properly hold the football for
Charlie Brown to kick and then just as he put all he had into a running
kick she would pull the ball away sending poor Charlie Brown flying into
the air and landing embarrassingly on his back.  No matter how many
times Lucy reneged on her promises, Charlie Brown would always believe
her sincerity and take one more run at the ball.

This story clearly illustrates the relationship between the Republican
Party and much of the establishment press here in California.  Allow me
to share my experience this morning as an example.

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.

Subject:	RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)


The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

"constellate: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Find him and other
winners in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American Writers.
http://www.m-w.com/book/peoplace/amwrit.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 18 is:

constellate   \KAHN-stuh-layt\   (verb)
     transitive senses 1 : to unite in a cluster
     2 : to set or adorn with or as if with constellations
     *intransitive sense : cluster

Example sentence:
     ""[Fireflies] constellate and then, for a moment, they all
go dark at once."" (_The New York Times_, July 5, 1997)

Did you know?
     It's plain that ""constellate"" is related to ""constellation,""
and indeed, things that ""constellate"" (or ""are constellated"")
cluster together like stars in a constellation. Both words
derive ultimately from the Latin word for ""star,"" which is
""stella."" ""Constellation"" (which came to us by way of Middle
French from Late Latin ""constellation-, constellatio"") entered
the language first -- it dates to at least the 14th century.
""Constellate"" appeared on the scene a few centuries later, in
the mid-17th century.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Subject:	RE: New instrument type code from ENPower

Frank,
Just wanted to let you know that at some point in time(not too long), this process of us changing the instrument type codes to manage upstream changes to instrument type codes will fail. This change must be handled by EnPower and given to RisktRAC. This way, we do not have to be concerned when new instrument type code changes are introduced. Since the interface of exchanging data is then owned by the upstream system, any changes happening in the calc programs will simultaneously affect the interface and the change will be made at that point. This will also be an incentive for upstream users to be more aware of the changes. We can concentrate on providing better quality reports and give the time to clean up our reporting and database efficiency. Otherwise, I have the team changing our programs to keep up with upstream system feeds.

Ganapathy Ramesh

Subject:	New instrument type code from ENPower

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Regards,

Wei

"RE: option volatilities used in portcalc","Dr Yang,

The RETAIL EAST portfolio needs to use the same methodology  as the EAST portfolio and the RETAIL WEST portfolio needs to use the same methodology as the WEST portfolio.  I believe that how Stacey wants the vols calculated is as follows.  If a deal that uses volatility in its calculation is at a region in the EAST it should use the daily or monthly vols respectively.  If a deal is at a west Region, than it should use the blending methodologies used in the WEST portfolio.  This will allow deals between the EAST and WEST portfolio to use the correct vols if such a deal were entered.  The transmission deals may not explicitly state a time horizon for exercise, but the nature of the deal allows you to make your decision on use of the transmission on a daily basis therefore,  I believe transmission deals should always use the daily volatilities.

Subject:	option volatilities used in portcalc

Dear All:

  Here is a summary of how volatility curves are used in portcalc option evaluation:

Rule:

1.  IF it is monthly option OR if the expiration date is explicitly specified in the deal entry,
     Then use monthly volatility 

2.  IF it is one of the following portfolios: EAST, ENAWEATHER, SIMTRADE, ENACCO, PLANT, SVCE AND
         it is one of the following instrument type: Option, Spread Option, Basis Option, Index Option
    Then
         use daily volatility for daily option, use monthly curve for monthly option

   Otherwise
      If it is current month,  use daily volatility
      Otherwise use blend volatility of monthly and daily(intra-month) curves.

3. For Asian strips, basket volatility is used based on monthly weekday and weekend volatility curves.

I'd like to point out that as a result of the above rules, 

1. for transmission deals, which does not explicitly specify expiration frequency or expiration date, for both East and West portfolios, daily volatility curve is used for current month, blend volatility is used for forward months.

2. Retail East and Retail West behave the same as West portfolio.

Please let us know if you need further clarification on how volatility curves are used in portcalc and advice us if any changes should be made.

Thank you very much,

- Zhiyun

Subject:	RE: Interest Rates

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

"frigorific: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Find him and other
winners in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American Writers.
http://www.m-w.com/book/peoplace/amwrit.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 16 is:

frigorific   \frih-guh-RIH-fik\   (adjective)
     : causing cold : chilling

Example sentence:
     Jamie shivered as she faced the frigorific blast of wind
blowing off the lake.

Did you know?
     The chill in ""frigorific"" comes from ""frigus,"" the Latin
word for ""frost"" or ""cold."" (""Frigorific"" is derived from the
Latin ""frigorificus,"" the adjective form of ""frigus."") ""Frigus""
has provided us with other icy words as well. It is the source
of ""refrigerate"" (""to keep cold""), and also of the combining
form ""frigo-"" (""cold"") and the noun ""frigorimeter"" (""a
thermometer designed for low temperatures""), both of which are
primarily scientific and somewhat rare. ""Frigus"" is also
related to the ancestors of ""frigid"" (""intensely cold"").
""Frigorific"" is a relatively unusual word and is used
considerably less often than its relatives ""refrigerate"" and
""frigid.""

Subject:	Enpower Outage Notice ***THIS WEEKEND***

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Thanks,  David Poston

The Performing/Non-Performing separation for power was not even done until mid-Jan, so there is no way to provide p&l on the comparative positions back in Dec.  Basically, our MTD, QTD and YTD p&l is all the same amount.
 
Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: FW: EWS DPR


Several groups have asked about the ""11/30 to date"" column on the DPR and what should be included in that number.  The intent was to report the p&l activity since Enron filed for bankruptcy, therefore including December p&l and January to date p&l, for the current DPR.  However, the question of whether we have the ability to include December's p&l is open.  The report should not include active deals which we do not intend to perform on, but those deals may not have been removed by the end of December from everyone's p&l.  
 
Please let me know if this is the case for your books.
 
Thanks,
Chris

To simplify the DPR reporting each Wednesday and Monday, please use the attached spreadsheet to populate and return via email.  This is a temporary solution and I will be working to set up a new export process the streamline reporting.  I would appreciate it if the spreadsheets were emailed priro to noon each Wednesday and Monday.  The main info to include are the positions, p&l and PRMA.
 
Please remember to include only the information related to active deals that we anticipate fulfilling.  If there are any pieces that should be captured, and for whatever reason you are not able to at this time, please note that as a caveat at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

"option volatilities used in portcalc","Dear All:

  Here is a summary of how volatility curves are used in portcalc option evaluation:

Rule:

1.  IF it is monthly option OR if the expiration date is explicitly specified in the deal entry,
     Then use monthly volatility 

2.  IF it is one of the following portfolios: EAST, ENAWEATHER, SIMTRADE, ENACCO, PLANT, SVCE AND
         it is one of the following instrument type: Option, Spread Option, Basis Option, Index Option
    Then
         use daily volatility for daily option, use monthly curve for monthly option

   Otherwise
      If it is current month,  use daily volatility
      Otherwise use blend volatility of monthly and daily(intra-month) curves.

3. For Asian strips, basket volatility is used based on monthly weekday and weekend volatility curves.

I'd like to point out that as a result of the above rules, 

1. for transmission deals, which does not explicitly specify expiration frequency or expiration date, for both East and West portfolios, daily volatility curve is used for current month, blend volatility is used for forward months.

2. Retail East and Retail West behave the same as West portfolio.

Please let us know if you need further clarification on how volatility curves are used in portcalc and advice us if any changes should be made.

Thank you very much,

- Zhiyun

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Peace at Any Price is Total Capitulation
By Dorothy Anne Seese

We're in a world at war and that isn't really news, nor has it been for
the last several thousand years of human history.  It's just more global
in both impact and in news coverage.

For the United States and North America in general, war that affects
this nation's home soil is new because of the isolation we enjoyed in
the 20th century.  It must be remembered that war on US soil was common
from the American Revolution through the War between the North and
South.  It was conventional war, even primitive compared to today's
technological warfare, but death is death, whether by musket, by nuclear
weapons, or by bioterrorism.

What we must remember is that peace at any price isn't peace and will
never result in anything other than more bloodshed.  ""Cleansing""
practices, particularly of a vanquished enemy where there has been
long-standing hatred, is common practice and has been since the
beginning of recorded history.  So-called ""peaceniks"" and the
mentally-manipulated students who generally fall for the socialist line
of drivel would do well to remember that the only reason they're free to
be peaceniks is that wars were fought to preserve their right to speak
out.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  I'm speaking to you today from Shanghai,
China, at an international meeting of Pacific Rim nations where we are
continuing to enlist the resources of the civilized world in our war
against terrorism.

I am meeting with leaders from China and Mexico, Russia and Canada,
Australia and Japan, and many other friends, allies, and trading
partners.  We're discussing ways to cooperate to improve intelligence,
freeze funding, and better track down terrorist groups.  We're also
discussing ways to better protect all our citizens from a new threat,
the threat of bioterrorism.

America has now confirmed several different cases of anthrax exposure in
Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.  I commend the many
health and law enforcement officials who have worked quickly to identify
people who may have been exposed, and provide preventative antibiotic
treatment.  Their quick work has no doubt saved lives.

Controlling Our Fear
By Alan Keyes

The nature, scope and source of the anthrax assault on the United States
may be much more evident by the time you read this.  Already, it is
clear that the scattered, partially successful attempts to distribute
the deadly spores have had some success in frightening millions of
people who have no reasonable likelihood of being affected. Some are
calling for authorities to restrict or even suppress reporting of
additional cases, lest the fear spread, or become a panic.  But this
kind of response to adversity is incompatible with the requirements of
liberty or self-government.  The situation we must confront should make
us all ask ourselves who is finally responsible for controlling our
fear. It is a question with serious implications for a free people.

Bravery is the virtue of having the right amount of fear, and
confidence, in the face of real danger, and of acting accordingly. It
requires reason and disciplined passions. This is a combination we
should know something about in the land of the free and the home of the
brave.

Smallpox As Bioterrorism: A Major Threat Looms
By Carol Devine-Molin

Although this nation is beset by anthrax anxiety, it's important to
place the current threat in perspective. To date, only the offices of a
few politicians and big media outlets appear to have been targeted by
anthrax mailings. And, despite the apoplectic reaction from many, the
anthrax assault has resulted in only one death, with a handful of
individuals manifesting the disease, and approximately forty others
tested and found to exhibit asymptomatic exposure to the substance.
Clearly this is a form of bioterrorism, with Islamic fanatics considered
the prime suspects by most, although some perpetrators of hoaxes and
copycat activities are under investigation as well.

ANTHRAX: Why Such a Panic?
By Gregg Bish

The panic over anthrax is more a sign of the times than a sign of fear
at terrorist activity.

Listening to the news on Saturday morning TV, one could come away with
the notion that every other person in the US was infected with anthrax,
and those not infected were exposed. All of the major news outlets, CBS,
NBC, ABC, Fox and CNN carried at least one headline news article
regarding the anthrax scare.

It is a sign of the times that one death, less than a dozen infections,
and fewer than a hundred exposures would set the emotional and financial
well-being of the nation on its ear.

We have forgotten much.

Hijacking the Language of Terrorism
By Doug Patton

""War is peace.  Freedom is slavery.  Ignorance is strength."" -- From the
novel, 1984, by George Orwell

Some believe that the terror of Orwell's masterful 1949 vision - with
its two-way ""telescreens"" installed in every home, constantly reminding
citizens that ""Big Brother is watching"" - lay in its portrayal of the
absolute totalitarian control of every citizen's movements.

As one who deals in the nuance of language, I have always found the
prospect of ""Newspeak"" much more troubling.  Newspeak was an entire
language Orwell created for the construction of the world of 1984.
Instead of evolving, as most language does, Newspeak devolved with each
passing year, until words once taken for granted no longer existed, had
been replaced by something entirely different (or completely opposite)
in meaning or had no meaning at all.  Hence, the slogan, ""War is
peace...freedom is slavery...ignorance is strength.""

Over the last twenty years, political correctness has brought Newspeak
to our modern world.  Many of us viewed it as mere silliness or a
passing fad.  No more.  Newspeak has come with a vengeance to America
and to its war on terror.

The Harsh Economic Costs of 911
By SARTRE

Now that the task of recovery has begun in earnest, we need to evaluate
the after effects of the earth shattering massacre. With estimates well
over 100 Billion Dollars for New York City alone, we are in store for
some major realignments in the national economy. The federal government
will subsidize and grant a large portion of these funds. Coming out of
our pockets is nothing new for most of us. But the underlying changes to
the functions of the Capitalistic order, may well be much more
significant in the long run.

First it needs to be noted that the economic system that now goes under
the 'so called' title of Capitalism, no longer conforms to even an
expanded definition of Free Enterprise. The reality of economic life in
the United States can best be understood as an alliance of the
Corporations/MoneyInterest/Government Axis. The central structures that
serve as the positional referent, is the nature of this axis. The
beneficiaries of this confederation are owners, managers, employees,
investment bankers, security brokers, speculators, investors,
politicians, bureaucrats, judges and lawyers. Their degrees of benefit
are not equal, but each has a vestige interest in protecting the
functions of the present 'status quo'. Resistance to meaningful reform
or fundamental realignment is at the core of most policy decisions.

Kevin,

In an attempt to begin the setup of trading books and desks for Netco, we will need a list of desk assignments (i.e. which trader will be trading which region) and the regional organization (i.e. Northeast, Midwest, etc.) of such desks.  Also, will East traders be trading only east delivery points?

Thanks!

"livid: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Enjoy a year's worth of poems, puns, and puzzles in
The Best of an Almanac of Words at Play.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/puzzspec/wordplay.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for February 1 is:

livid   \LIH-vid\   (adjective)
     1 : discolored by bruising : black-and-blue
     2 : ashen, pallid
     3 : reddish
    *4 : very angry : enraged

Example sentence:
     ""When my mother caught me sneaking in after midnight, she
was livid,"" Abby reported.

Did you know?
     ""Livid"" has a colorful history. The Latin adjective
""lividus"" means ""dull, grayish, or leaden blue."" From this came
the French ""livide,"" and eventually the English ""livid,"" which
originally was used to describe flesh discolored by a bruise.
By the end of the 18th century, a slight extension of meaning
had given it the sense ""ashen or pallid,"" as in describing a
corpse. ""Livid"" eventually came to be used in this sense to
characterize the complexion of a person pale with anger (""livid
with rage""). From this meaning came two new senses in the 20th
century. One was ""reddish,"" as one is as likely to become red
with anger as pale; the other was simply ""angry"" or ""furious,""
the most common sense of the word today.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a ""?"" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is ""wait 60 days on PX""...""annuity 4 sale back to them"".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
Tracy

"New Pub Codes for Enpower","Good Morning Stacey,

Jeff Richter wants to start trading ancillary service deals through EOL.  To help facilitate this new business, we need to setup several new pub codes that represent the indexes the California ISO publishes for ancillary services.  A few of the ancillary pub codes are already setup we just need to add the ones for spin & non-spin.  Do you know who we need to get with to have these new pub codes setup?  I will work with the IT guys to ensure the programs that scrape the ISO site and store the prices are updated to capture these new indexes.

Thanks,  David Poston

ps - Please give me a call if you have any questions, 57834


These pub codes already exist:

ISOGRRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLRRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26


These pub codes need to be created:

ISOGSRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLSRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

ISOGNRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)

Tom,

After our call today Mike Purcell and I spent a little time talking.  We also have some time schedule to Cara and Jeff Richter tomorrow  I have put together the attached  template which I will hopefully have filled out for you by tomorrow afternoon.

Our biggest concern today was how we would address the Real-Time scheduling requirements.  Mark Guzman is part of the estate and should be able to cover the day shift during the week and we can outsource to UBS to cover all the other shifts (Just a proposal).  In addition, Lester Rawson is part of the estate and has Real-Time experience and is also the individual who currently manages the El Paso obligations.

If you have any questions please give me a call @ 503-702-9846.

The Power desks were set up with the identifier as NETCO as part of the name to keep them separate from the old book names. The set up was done originally in the Estate Environ. before the systems were split.  The name can be changed to lose the NETCO ref. if need be.  Hope this clarifies the many email attachments below!

These NETCO references should not have been part of the test.  
After today, the upstream source needs to remove (or rename) to their real name.  NetCo named testing was for last week only.

Wednesday and Thursday testing should not use these desks.

Andrea,
I'm hearing from David Poston that EOL deals were sent down with old desks (?) that kicked out of EnPower.

David,
Attached is what EOL sent, please verify these loaded.
What data did EOL send down incorrectly?  We need to fix for the Wednesday and Thursday test.

 << File: trans summary 020402 POWER.xls >> 

I'm also hearing from Lori that the deals were not scheduled?  Who does this, and I assume we need to reschedule for the new data?

Andrea,
Can you verify the spreadsheet of the deals you processed for Power, and send your updates back?

Regan-

I'm still having a problem seeing those deals in Deal Entry.  If I run a search, it tells me that there are 'no records selected', which is very strange as I know there are at least 20 deals in there that have been entered by either myself or the EOL testers.  Any ideas?

Andrea

"perennial: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Did you know Julius Caesar moved January to the head
of the year? Click here for your guide to word histories.
http://www.m-w.com/book/literead/wordhist.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 6 is:

perennial   \puh-REH-nee-ul\   (adjective)
     1 : present at all seasons of the year
     2 : continuing to live from year to year
     3 a : persistent, enduring b : continuing without
interruption : constant, perpetual *c : regularly repeated or
renewed : recurrent

Example sentence:
     The perennial problem of what to do with our pets while we
were on vacation was solved for this year when Aunt Ruth
volunteered to house-sit.

Did you know?
     Nowadays when we talk about ""perennial plants,"" or simply
""perennials"" (""perennial"" can be a noun, too), we mean plants
that die back seasonally but produce new growth in the spring.
But originally ""perennial"" was equivalent to ""evergreen,"" used
for plants that remain with us all year. We took this
""throughout the year"" sense straight from the Romans, whose
Latin ""perennis"" attached ""per-"" (""throughout"") to a form of
""annus"" (""year""). The poet Ovid, writing around the beginning
of the first millennium, used the Latin word to refer to a
""perennial spring"" (water source), and the scholar Pliny used it
of birds that don't migrate. Our ""perennial"" retains these same
uses, for streams and occasionally for birds, but it has long
had extended meanings too.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

"cacophony: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Looking for a new kind of feeding frenzy? Feast on colorful
references in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions.
http://www.m-w.com/book/writref/allusion.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 14 is:

cacophony   \ka-KAH-fuh-nee\   (noun)
     : harsh or discordant sound : dissonance;
specifically : harshness in the sound of words or phrases

Example sentence:
     A cacophony of angry voices filled the room as the
discussion between city council members heated up.

Did you know?
     Whether they refer to the sound of music or the sound of
nails on a chalkboard, words that descend from the Greek word
""phone"" are making a lot of noise in English. Why? Because
""phone"" means ""sound"" or ""voice."" ""Cacophony"" comes from a
joining of the Greek prefix ""kak-"" (""bad"") with ""phone,"" and it
essentially means ""bad sound."" ""Symphony,"" a word that indicates
harmony or agreement in sound, traces to ""phone"" and the Greek
prefix ""syn-"" (""together""). ""Polyphony"" refers to a style of
musical composition in which two or more independent melodies
are juxtaposed in harmony, and it comes from a combination of
""phone"" and the Greek prefix ""poly-"" (""many""). Keep your ears
open and you're sure to hear other descendants of ""phone"" in
English.

"Your October WellsWire","In This Edition
Banking Essentials
Investment Accounts
Managing Your Financial Accounts
Managing Your Money
Back to Basics
Taking the first steps toward financial freedom starts with the 
basics. Whether you bank online, via ATM, phone, in person, or any 
combination of these, becoming familiar with the accounts and 
services your bank offers will make it easier to find the loans, 
credit cards and even home mortgages that are right for you. By 
learning what your bank has to offer, you can take advantage 
of the financial products and services that best fit your 
financial needs.
Banking Essentials
It's important to learn the features of even the most basic 
banking products. Finding the right account is easy when you've 
done the research. 
Checking and Savings Accounts
Most people have checking and savings accounts, but may not know 
that the types of accounts available vary widely. Everybody's 
financial needs are different, and that's why it's important to 
choose the account that fits the way you want to bank and enhances 
your lifestyle. 
? Checking Accounts. Do you keep a steady amount of money in your 
checking account? Is your checking account your main financial 
services account? The right checking account has it all - 
convenience, flexibility and fast, easy access to your money. 
Checking accounts give you the freedom to write checks against 
your account balance and to have access to your money through an 
ATM or online banking. And since everyone's financial needs are 
different, there are a wide variety of checking accounts available, 
including interest bearing or non-interest bearing, all of which 
are FDIC insured. From accounts that offer you free checking with 
direct deposit to low-fee student accounts to top-of-the-line 
financial relationship accounts, there's a checking account 
that fits your lifestyle. 
? Savings Accounts. Whether you're saving for a new house or a 
child's college education, the best way to achieve your financial 
goals is to put money away each month. An Automatic Savings Plan 
makes saving even easier by automatically moving a pre-determined 
amount of money between your accounts. Savings accounts are interest- 
bearing accounts with low minimum balance requirements. They are 
a convenient way to save for the future and most savings accounts 
can be used as overdraft protection for your checking account. Find 
out more about the variety of savings accounts  available to you. 
? Time Accounts (CDs)
If you're planning for a vacation or saving for the future, time 
accounts , also known as certificates of deposit, are a solid choice for your 
savings needs. Time accounts offer guaranteed rates of return for a fixed term, 
flexibility in length of investment term and are eligible for FDIC insurance. 
ATM, Check, and Credit Cards
Both ATM cards and check cards provide convenient access to your 
accounts, allowing you to withdraw cash, make deposits and transfer 
funds through an ATM. An ATM card  also offers you the ability to make 
purchases using your Secret Code or Personal Identification Number 
(PIN) at participating merchants. With a check card , you have 
expanded purchasing power at merchants worldwide that accept either 
Visa
 (or MasterCard
), depending on which logo is displayed on your 
card. Whenever you use a check card or ATM card to make a purchase, 
the purchase amount is always deducted from your checking account 
and detailed on your monthly statement for easy record keeping. 
Additionally, there are several types of credit cards , which give 
you the convenience and financial flexibility of paying for your 
purchases over time, depending on your credit limit. With all of 
these choices, there is definitely a card (or cards) that is right 
for you. 
Investment Accounts
These days, most people have some sort of an investment account. 
However, the type of investment account people choose depends on 
their comfort level and goals. Whether you're new to investing, 
experienced at managing your own investments, or simply want to work 
with a financial consultant, there are options for you. 
? Full-service brokerage. New to investing? Prefer talking to 
somebody in person? An experienced financial consultant can help. 
It's not always easy making investment choices on your own. Working 
with a financial consultant , you get the tailored advice you need to 
make informed investment decisions. 
? Online brokerage. If you prefer to manage your investments on 
your own, online brokerage  gives you the dynamic tools to manage your 
portfolio, research the marketplace, assess your opportunities and 
make the right decisions. 
? Wells ShareBuilder. With Wells ShareBuilder  you can invest in 
stocks and index shares in regular intervals, weekly or monthly. Over 
time, you will automatically build your portfolio share by share. 
With no investment minimums and low transaction fees, this 
affordable technique uses dollar-cost averaging to help you 
reach your long-term goals. 
Managing Your Financial Accounts
? Online Banking Basics
How do you access your accounts? In a branch, at an ATM, over the 
phone, or online? As many people have discovered, banking online is 
the fastest, most convenient way to access all their accounts, manage 
investments, transfer funds and pay bills - all with just the click 
of a mouse. 
? Online account access. Need to check your balance from work? Want 
to make a quick transfer between accounts but don't have time to stop 
at the bank or ATM? Online account access  lets you view your account 
balances and transactions, transfer funds, pay bills online, and 
contact customer service. It's an easy and convenient way to manage 
your accounts from your computer. 
? Online bill pay. With online bill pay, you can pay any individual 
or company in the U.S. from the comfort of your home computer, the 
office, or anywhere you have Internet access. And the money you will 
save on postage can really add up. Try this demo  to see how easy 
it is. 
Managing Your Money
If you're like most people, you work hard and strive to achieve your 
dreams. It's important to build a financial foundation to ensure you 
arrive where you want to be. Here are a few tips on how you can make 
smart decisions about your financial future. 
Taking Control of Your Finances
It's not how much you make, but what you do with your money that 
matters. Cutting out a few minor expenses can make a big difference 
in your savings. There's no better way to stay out of debt than by 
tracking your spending and sticking to a budget. A budget can help 
you control your finances, decrease your debt, and build a strong 
credit history. Where do you spend your money? Determining your cash 
flow is the first step in creating a successful budget. 
Building Your Credit and Controlling Debt
Managing credit can be a challenge. But a good credit rating is key 
to many financial decisions. Learning how to establish and maintain 
good credit  can make a big difference in your savings. Understanding 
how to manage your debt can empower you to take charge of your 
financial future. The quality of your life is directly linked to how 
well you manage your credit and debt.

The Word of the Day for January 22 is:

paronomasia   \pair-uh-no-MAY-zhee-uh or pair-ah-nuh-MAY-zhee-uh\
(noun)
     : a play on words : pun

Example sentence:
     Humorists claim that Harry Truman offered the delightful
paronomasia ""Missouri loves company"" when he invited a friend
to join him in Independence, Missouri for a home-cooked meal.

Did you know?
     Puns (essentially, humorous uses of words to suggest more
than one interpretation) have their share of critics as well as
fans. Coleridge, for example, called puns ""the lowest form of
wit."" ""Paronomasia,"" which derives from a Greek verb meaning ""to
call with a slight change of name,"" can simply be a synonym of
""pun."" But it can also be used, somewhat playfully, to suggest
an uncontrollable urge to make puns (as if it were a dread
disease, rather than harmless word play). For example, in the
July 6, 1980 _New York Times_, William Safire announced, ""an
epidemic of paronomasia has raced around the world."" And on
January 1, 1989, Jerry Kobrin of _The Orange County Register_
resolved to seek treatment ""for a near-terminal case of
paronomasia.""

Should the west desk update in ""Schedule"" all transactions that flowed in December?

Tim,

John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

New Poll shows the Existence of Political Bias on Ivy League Faculties

David Horowitz, President of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture
today released a poll taken on the beliefs and attitudes of Ivy League
professors.

The survey, conducted by the Luntz Research Companies, reveals a
disturbing lack of intellectual diversity among the Ivy League
professors polled, and raises questions about political bias in the
hiring of faculty at schools training America's future elites. The
survey was conducted among professors on the social science and liberal
arts faculties at the schools.

David Horowitz said, ''This survey confirms what I have been saying for
years -- that our universities are less intellectually free than they
were even in the McCarthy era, when I was an Ivy League undergraduate
myself.''

A Closer Look at Somalia
By Austin Bay

It would be rhetorically elegant -- and a profoundly simpler diplomatic
issue -- if Somalia mimicked Julius Caesar's assessment of Gaul and
merely split into three parts.

It doesn't. Anarchic Somalia is arguably the planet's foremost ""failed
state,"" with Afghanistan and the Congo as basket-case competitors. Find
a sub-clan with a savvy leader, or a gang on a street corner, and you
have what passes for governing structure in much of Mogadishu and its
environs.

As Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz noted, Somalia attracts Al
Qaeda ""precisely because the government is weak or nonexistent.""
American counter-terror ""options"" there are limited, Wolfowitz added,
since ""by definition you don't have a government you can work with.""

The Ugly Business of Profiling
By Linda Chavez

Racial profiling is an ugly business -- and I have been on record
opposing it for years. But I'm not opposed to allowing -- no, requiring
-- airlines to pay closer attention to passengers that fit a terrorist
profile, which includes national origin. The problem is distinguishing
between what is permissible, indeed prudent, behavior and what is merely
bigotry. As the Christmas day incident involving an Arab American Secret
Service agent who was denied passage on an American Airlines makes
clear, it's not always easy to tell the difference.

Racial profiling entails picking someone out for special scrutiny simply
because of his race. It happens when highway patrolmen pull over blacks
who've committed no traffic violations for spot checks but ignore other
drivers who share similar characteristics, say out-of-state plates or
expensive cars. It happens when security guards at a mall tail black
customers in stores or insist on inspecting only their bags, ignoring
whites. The underlying presumption in these cases is that blacks are
more likely to be involved in criminal acts because of the color of
their skin.

Breaux Let The Dogs Out
By Mike Bayham

Last Thursday, gubernatorial front-runner and current US Senator John
Breaux announced that he would not be a candidate in the 2003 Louisiana
governor's race.  Breaux had previously been heralded as an unstoppable
candidate by political pundits and at varying times appeared to be a
likely contender.

Evidence of his early support could be found in the parking lot of the
hotel where he held his press conference in which there were several
cars sporting bumper stickers that read ""Breaux for Governor.""  However,
the best hope for the Democrats to take back the governor's office opted
out of the race stating that he can better serve Louisiana by remaining
in the US Senate.

Terror War: Phase 2
By Nicholas M. Horrock and Dennis Lewis

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UPI) -- While U.S. forces continue to search for
Osama bin Laden and al Qaida members, the Bush administration has
quietly shifted its priority to attacking terrorism in Somalia, Yemen,
Indonesia and the Philippines, sources say.

The United States currently has intelligence operations in those four
nations, selected because they expressed willingness to cooperate. Their
countries also have vast lawless areas where al Qaida and other
terrorist cells are known to have operated, well-placed administration
and congressional sources tell United Press International.

A well written article, and so timely.  I've been a Rumsfeld groupie,
since 9/11 when he didn't run from the disaster at the Pentagon, but
plunged into the wreckage to save people.  Also, he sent his 2nd in
charge to the bomb shelter, because he was too old to be that valuable.
My husband, brother and I have enjoyed the ex-mil men, Vietnam, ""

Hi Stacey:

  Just want to follow up to see if there is any after thought about what we discussed yesterday on Index Option.  From our discussion, index option will be reported in two records:  reported as physical in the delivery region, and financial in the index region with the corresponding position and risks.    This seems to be a better alternative than reporting the collapsed position in the delivery region in one record or reporting both position as physical  in two records in the delivery and index region.  

   Could you please let me know if we should go ahead  implementing the changes?  We plan to move the current stage to production tonight and do a new stage release this week, I'd like this change, if going to occur, to go into this release.

   Thanks a lot.

The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?

What is your status on liquidations? I noticed that you are looking at the fin liq report, etc. Are you running the Max Exp and liq rec even though the liquidations for Dec are not final? 

Stacey, should we have also set up the Orig trading book? Should we have included that in the book requests?

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 21 is:

aggress  \uh-GRESS\   (verb)
     : to commit aggression : to act aggressively

Example sentence:
     Certain indicators, such as irritability, can indicate an
animal's likelihood to aggress.

Did you know?
     ""Aggress"" and its more familiar relatives ""aggression"" and
""aggressive"" derive from the Latin verb ""aggredi,"" meaning ""to
approach, attack, undertake."" When ""aggress"" was first used in
English in the 16th century, it meant ""to approach,"" but that
use is now obsolete. The current meaning of the word has been
with us since the early 18th century. Back then, the noun
""aggress"" (""an attack"") appeared occasionally as well, but time
has relegated that use to obsolescence, too.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

I don't know about this, buttttttt you never know.  The women who wrote the
original email did leave her name and telephone.  I tried to call this
morning just to see who would answer the phone but I have been getting a
fast busy signal--which could be from our weather????  Anyway, I guess

"aplomb: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
What's another word for snowball? Watch your vocabulary
snowball with Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/thesaur/thes.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 28 is:

aplomb   \uh-PLAHM or uh-PLUM\   (noun)
     : complete and confident composure or self-assurance : poise

Example sentence:
     Never once betraying the fact that this was a first effort,
Rachel delivered the product presentation with the aplomb of a
trade show veteran.

Did you know?
     Aplomb ultimately comes from the French phrase ""a plomb,""
meaning ""according to the plummet."" A plummet is a lead weight
that is attached to a line and used to determine vertical
alignment. In French, the literal meaning of ""aplomb"" is
""perpendicularity,"" and the extended meaning is ""composure.""
English speakers borrowed ""aplomb,"" in its extended sense, in
the 19th century. The French ""plomb"" is also the source of the
English word ""plumb,"" meaning ""to measure depth"" and ""to
explore critically and minutely.""

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Parameters!!!

Three aspiring psychiatrists were attending their first
class on emotional extremes.  ""Just to establish some
parameters,"" said the professor, to the student from
Arkansas, ""What is the opposite of joy?""
""Sadness,""  said the student.
""and the opposite of depression?""  he asked of the young
lady from Oklahoma.
""Elation,""  she said.
""And you sir,"" he said to the young man from Texas,
""How about the opposite of woe?""
The Texan replied, ""Sir, I believe that would be  giddy up.""

Subject:	Power Month End Procedures


In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

"R20 - Ontario","Garrett,
Recognizing that Ontario does not open until Mar 02, and recognizing that we have positions starting then, and recognizing that the curve doesn't have prices posted for reference dates prior to Mar 02, the value-at-risk engine is getting errors in it's simulations due to lack of prices thereof.  

Can you do either of the below?
?	Post prices for dates up to Mar 02?  (realize their isn't market?.tough issue)
o	If you post a price, I'm not sure it will mean much other than letting VAR run, primarily because there isn't position prior to Mar 02. Perhaps you can fill in hole with a realistic price so prompt month correlations don't go wacko?I guess.. Stacey help. 
?	Recommend a ""like"" curve to map R20 to so that we can get around zero price issues?  Realize that mapping will include entire term structure and not just for the reference dates with zero price.
?	Other ideas?

I appreciate your help in working toward a solution.

Hey John, things are going well both work and family.  Hope the same is true for you.

The forward curve used interest rates to derive it's shape, so, holding everything steady, as the interest rate curve changed, the forward curve changed.  I can talk with you about this further, and we can step out a specific example if you like.

Let me know what you need.

Subject:	Some questions for you

Greg Woulfe, how are things shakin in the big H? How are the kids, how is work? I hear your out of the broadband game and into that wild and wacky EES game. That is definitely like burning your hands twice. 

I have a question for you regarding the great world of emissions. Unfortunately I cannot rid myself of these damn things and I was wondering if you might be able to answer a question for me. We have copied the emissions calc in Enpower because we are now trading renewables in California.  If you remember, all emission fwd deals were discounted to the delivery date of the deal. I thought that one of the requests that you had made to the IT group when they were setting up the calc is that there would be p/l associated with a change in interest rates (curve shift), even if you hadn't changed the curves. This was in addition to the normal rho and drift that we would see. I seem to remember you and Charlie talking about this when you were discussing the models you had created for forward pricing. Does this ring a bell with you?

Obviously, you can tell that we are getting curve shift based on int rate changes even when the curves don't change. This is the same coding that was used when we created emissions so we must have done it for a reason.

Stacey,

Let me know if this is what you are looking for.


Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"RE: information for the creditors committee","Shona - 

A few points/questions on the request:

1.  How detailed do you want the ""rolls supporting DPR information"".....I ask because we have about 40 individual rolls which constitute our DPR info.  Do they just want a print-out from Excel of each of these rolls?!

2.  All PRMA info needs to come from Accounting (Tracy Greene)

3.  What are they classifying as an ""open"" transaction?!  If you let me know how they are differentiating between an ""open"" and an ""active"" transaction, I can possibly have our IT guys run a script to get a number in an efficient manner.

4.  We can get you the number of books and commercial support people

5.  Average number of transactions per day can possibly be obtained from someone in the EOL group (and then simply extrapolated to obtain a number representing our complete population of deals) as EOL constitutes approximately 75% of the power trading activity

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

I will be at the Hyatt tomorrow for the all-employee meeting and I hope that each one of you will plan to attend as well.  Certainly with current press coverage and market reaction last week and today, there will be many questions for Ken, Greg and Mark to address tomorrow.  It will be important for all of us as members of the senior leadership team of ENW to be familiar with tomorrow's discussion at the all-employee meeting.  

To provide a follow-up opportunity to discuss what we hear in tomorrow's all-employee meeting, I invite you to attend an informal lunch meeting with me in ECS 4990 beginning at 12:00 noon.  This will give us the chance to clarify what we have heard and to collectively anticipate the reactions and additional questions that employees may have.  It will be important particularly now to be visible and accessible to our teams.  --Sally 

Please let Christina Valdez know today (x39106 or e-mail) if you will be at lunch on Tuesday so that we can place an order.

Did you know Julius Caesar moved January to the head
of the year? Click here for your guide to word histories.
http://www.m-w.com/book/literead/wordhist.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 5 is:

facile   \FASS-ul\   (adjective)
     1 a : easily accomplished, handled, or attained
*b : superficial
     2 : readily manifested and often insincere
     3 : ready, fluent

Example sentence:
     The book is well-organized, but the conclusions and
interpretations are often unduly facile.

Did you know?
     Would you have guessed that ""facile"" and ""difficult"" are
related? They are! ""Facile"" comes to us through Middle French,
from the Latin word ""facilis,"" meaning ""easy,"" and ultimately
from ""facere,"" meaning ""to make or do."" ""Difficult"" traces to
""facilis"" as well, but its history also involves the negative
prefix ""dis-,"" meaning ""not."" ""Facile"" can mean ""easy"" or
""easily done,"" as befits its Latin roots, but it now often adds
the connotation of undue haste, shallowness, or oversimplifi-
cation, as in ""facile answers to complex questions.""

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Let me know if this is what you are looking for.


Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date.

Partnership
Spurs Enron
Equity Cut
---
Vehicle Is Connected
To Financial Officer
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller

10/18/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page C1 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Enron Corp. shrank its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as the company decided to repurchase 55 million of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron didn't disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a $1.01 billion charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a $618 million loss. But the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity has dropped to $9.5 billion, the company said. 
In an interview Tuesday, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said that about $35 million of the $1.01 billion charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Mr. Fastow. In a conference call yesterday with investors, Mr. Lay said that the 55 million shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 million. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Mr. Causey didn't elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
In addition, Enron was receiving increasing criticism from analysts and major shareholders concerning the apparent conflict of interest involving the role of its chief financial officer in the partnership, from which he stood to make millions of dollars. In July, Mr. Fastow formally severed his connections to LJM. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, ""the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,"" Mr. Causey said. 
Enron downplayed the significance of the share-reduction exercise. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described it ""as just a balance-sheet issue"" and therefore wasn't deemed ""material"" for disclosure purposes. 
Jeff Dietret, an analyst for Simmons & Co. in Houston, said that a large reduction of equity could be ""a flag for the rating agencies"" because it could adversely affect a company's debt-to-equity ratio. Enron said yesterday that as a result of the equity reduction, its debt-to-equity ratio rose to 50% from 46% previously. 
On Tuesday, after Enron reported its big quarterly loss, Moody's Investors Service Inc. put Enron's long-term debt on review for a possible downgrade. Moody's said the move was related to ""significant write-downs and charges reflecting substantially reduced valuations"" in several of Enron's businesses. In recent years, Enron had moved aggressively into broadband telecommunications and the water business, both of which failed to produce expected returns. 
Enron, which as of June 30 had $33.6 billion in current liabilities and long-term debt, has lately been attempting to shed assets to pay down debt.

winners in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American Writers.
http://www.m-w.com/book/peoplace/amwrit.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 19 is:

mnemonic   \nih-MAH-nik\   (adjective)
     : assisting or designed to assist memory

Example sentence:
     Our music teacher taught us the mnemonic sentence ""Every
good boy does fine"" to help us remember the names of the lines
of the treble staff.

Did you know?
     The word ""mnemonic"" derives from Greek ""mnemon"" (""mindful""),
which itself comes from the Greek word for ""remember."" (In
classical mythology, Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses, is the
goddess of memory.) As with many classical borrowings, we
retained the double initial consonant, but not the pronunciation
of both, since the combination doesn't occur naturally in English.
(""Pneumonia"" is a similar case.) ""Mnemonic"" can also be a noun
meaning ""a mnemonic device."" If the spelling of this word strikes
you as particularly fiendish to remember, try this mnemonic to
get you started on the right track: keep in mind that although
the pronunciation begins with an ""n"" sound, the spelling begins
with an ""m,"" as in ""memory.""

"RE: Ancillary Curves","Thanks Frank.

My only concern with setting these up before you get the answer from Research is that I don't think we can control (from our end) the posting of positions on these curves once they are set up.  I think we can get around reporting benchmark positions by inserting a zero conversion factor; however, if the curves are setup in the region index mapping and a position is loaded on said curve I assume VaR would be calc'd.  

I think this may already be happening (calcing VaR with no positions) with the existing ancillary curves that are already setup.  I 've asked Casey to take a look.

Excellent question.  Currently I am working with Research to determine correct VAR methodology for ancillaries and as such we do not measure risk on these curves.  Even though this is the case we still require curves to be posted and maintained.

Frank,

The voicemail I left was regarding ancillary curves requested by John.  Burton may have emailed you on the request earlier.  I'm following up b/c he's out.

Question - Do we have a rule regarding whether or not we calculated VaR and capture positions for ancillary business?  Based on discussions with Casey Evans we don't report ancillary activity for her regions (var or positions).  In order to keep consistency across the business, it seems that we would either report all ancillary or none.  

Please advise.

Regards

KC

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Thanks,  David Poston

what I do about it.

little finger in his little fist, that you're
hooked for life.

mountain, but all the happiness and growth

The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"wherewithal: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Looking for a new kind of feeding frenzy? Feast on colorful
references in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions.
http://www.m-w.com/book/writref/allusion.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 11 is:

wherewithal   \WHAIR-with-awl\   (noun)
     : means, resources; specifically : money

Example sentence:
     It was obvious to Grace that her old car was on its last
legs, but she didn't have the wherewithal to replace it.

Did you know?
     ""Wherewithal"" has been with us in one form or another since
the 16th century. It comes from ""where"" and ""withal"" (meaning
""with""), and it has been used as a conjunction meaning ""with or
by means of which"" and as a pronoun meaning ""that with or by
which."" These days, however, it is almost always used as a noun
referring to the means or resources one has at one's disposal
-- especially financial resources, i.e., money.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

John,

Currently, there is no way we can meet this need.  The information we get from EOL does not include a desk id and we must determine the id based on the criteria given below.  

There are two possible solutions
1)  Add one or more other fields as criteria for determining the desk.
2)  Have EOL send the desk id in the bridge message.

Although I cannot speak for EOL IT, I suspect that solution 2 would be very involved.  I doubt that traders are even able to select a desk when creating a product in EOL.  Melba, can you verify this fact?

If option 1 is doable from a business perspective, we will need to discuss further the changes and timeline involved for IT.  This issues should be raise in the meeting with Steve Nat tomorrow.

Will

Fran,

All deals from EOL are mapped to a desk in EnPower following these rules:

There cannot be more than one desk for any combination of
Trader
Region
Nature (Phys/Fin)

Therefore, you can have a trader with different books, so long as either the Region or Nature is different.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi, Duong Luu and Will:

We are trying to add Tim Belden in EOL Adminstration (under Enpower) to be the Trader of ""NETCO Long Term Southwest"" after I have added him as the trader for ""NETCO Long Term California"",  but I kept getting below error message:

ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_DEAL_DEFAULT_DESKS) violated


Is this because we cannot have any individual to be the trader of more than one west book?

Please advise.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 24 is:

gravitate   \GRAV-uh-tayt\   (verb)
     1 : to move under the influence of gravitation
    *2 a : to move toward something  b : to be drawn or
attracted especially by natural inclination

Example sentence:
    The best athletes naturally gravitate toward the schools
with the most athletic scholarships.

Did you know?
     English has several weighty words descended from the Latin
""gravitas,"" meaning ""weight."" The first to arrive on the scene
was ""gravity,"" which appeared in the early 16th century
(originally meaning ""dignity or sobriety of bearing,"" it quickly
came to mean ""weight"" as well). Next came ""gravitation"" (used to
describe the force of gravity) and ""gravitate"" -- both mid-17th
century arrivals. ""Gravitate"" once meant ""to apply weight or
pressure,"" but that use is now obsolete. In the late 17th
century, it was recorded in the sense ""to move under the effect
of gravitation."" It then acquired a more general sense of ""to
move toward something"" (as toward a specific location), and
finally a metaphorical third sense of ""to be attracted"" (as
toward a person or a vocation).

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

We are in the process of trying to reach a final settlement with PSEG for all remaining settlements and MTM value of the future contracts.  They would like to finalize this by tomorrow or early next week.  I have told them that could be very difficult.  They would like to know when you expect the final reconciled numbers to be available.

"pittance: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Looking for a new kind of feeding frenzy? Feast on colorful
references in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions.
http://www.m-w.com/book/writref/allusion.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 9 is:

pittance   \PIH-tunss\   (noun)
     : a small portion, amount, or allowance; also : a meager
wage or remuneration

Example sentence:
     ""She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various
means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support
life."" (Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, _Frankenstein_)

Did you know?
     It's a pity when you haven't anything but a pittance. And
in fact, ""pity"" and ""pittance"" share etymological roots. The
Middle English ""pitance"" came from the Old French ""pitance,""
meaning ""pity"" or ""piety."" Originally, a ""pittance"" was a gift
or bequest to a religious community, or a small charitable gift.
Ultimately, the word comes from the Latin ""pietas,"" meaning
""piety"" or ""compassion."" Our words ""pity"" and ""piety"" come from
""pietas"" as well.

I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.

FYI -
 
Jennifer Stevenson at Andersen may be calling you all to try and verify something to assist us with our dual trigger accounting arguments.  We have been trying to prove to Andersen that the value in the dual trigger option lies more in the price volatility than the physical plant outage.  AA was perplexed by the approximate 50% margin on these deals.  Larry Marcus pointed out to them that this isn't any different than an out of the money call option which would also typically generate a 50% margin.  They believe that it will greatly help our argument if they can verify with a trader that this is true.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: status of CCO book accounting treatment


if a call option is way out of the money, such as the ones we purchased last summer, the premium is a multiple of the ""expected"" payout.  a trader may not respond well to the term ""margin"" because they dont calculate it. as an example, if the midmarket value for a $100 power call is $2.50, and a $500 call is expected to pay 40% as much, a trader would offer this illiquid instrument for $2, which would be like a 50% margin.  one problem with this analogy is that expected value of payout is frequently much lower than the midmarket because there are very few arbitrageurs in this market who can really take advantage of that.  this example does support the statement, but a trader will not think about it the same way.  they will not call this extreme vol smile on illiquid products a high margin.  harry arora would be the trader to talk to.

Patty Grutzmacher and Jennifer Stevenson (both Andersen) were scheduled to review our pricing model with Tom Bauer (Andersen partner) this week.  Due to issues relating to the Enron shareholders' lawsuit,  Tom could not meet with them.   Patty and Jennifer did have further discussions with Amitava and Vasant.   They are all right with the model.
 
Larry - 
Patty / Jennifer want to confirm your statement that a 50% margin on an out-of-the-money call option is not unusual.  They have asked Stacey White (Director of Power Risk Mgmt) to recommend a power trader with whom they can talk.  If you know of a person you would like them to talk with, please let me know.
 
Mary Cilia (transaction support) has asked Jennifer and Patty not to push the issue with Tom Bauer until he is in a more receptive mood.  We are still anticipating a resolution this quarter.   I will continue to keep you informed.

Subject:	New West Power Deal Info

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

"Food for thought","Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.

"New Script Request","Guys,

New task......we are going to change the primary counterparty on all of our other existing counterparties in the East and West portfolios to the following EPMI desk names:

EPMI-EAST-NPERF	(EPMI East Non Performance)
EPMI-WEST-NPERF	(EPMI West Non Performance)

Our goal is to have this done tomorrow.  I will provide you with a list of counterparties on which we will be changing all associated deals ASAP.

Let me know if you guys have any questions!
Thanks, as always!

Just wanted to give you a heads up so you can begin composing the script....

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.

"RE: Enpower positions","Tom,

For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select ""commodity"" only as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as they are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should query by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (region codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not energy positions, per se:

10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)

Let me know if you have any questions!

1) RisktRAC
2)Yes, except South America is not in EnPower yet.  The portfolio is set up, but no transactions are captured there.
3) The West looks close but the East is completely off.  Also, AlbertaENA should not be zero.
4) RetailEast & RetailWest are test Portfolios and should not be included!

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.
- Tom

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

Subject:	Dec and Jan liquidations

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

Frank,

The voicemail I left was regarding ancillary curves requested by John.  Burton may have emailed you on the request earlier.  I'm following up b/c he's out.

Question - Do we have a rule regarding whether or not we calculated VaR and capture positions for ancillary business?  Based on discussions with Casey Evans we don't report ancillary activity for her regions (var or positions).  In order to keep consistency across the business, it seems that we would either report all ancillary or none.  

Please advise.

Regards

KC

All, 
I received a call from Sally Beck today alerting me to concerns about spreading the risk group across the floor (gas team - power team).  From a control perspective she prefers that the team be all together.  

Can you factor this in and give Sally and me your thoughts as well?  Perhaps we could find an area that is more central to both groups that will help with this (as we've done with fundies).

Hey!  Just wanted to say thanks for the  Birthday Card.  Also, sorry we didn't get to see each other over the  weekend.  I was so excited because I was actually going to be able to give  you Fortune's Rocks back!  Can you believe I finished it?  It only  took me 3 months!  Now I am reading your To Tame a Texan's Heart.  So  maybe I will have it finished by the next time we see each other.
 
Have y'all seen any good movies  lately?  We went for my birthday and saw Don't Say a Word.  Couldn't  decide between that or Training Day.  Should have seen Training Day.   I was disappointed in the other one.  Of course Lamar said ""I told you  so"".
 
Well, I will let you go.  Take  care.
 
Love,
Karyn

Subject:	RE: information for the creditors committee

Shona - 

A few points/questions on the request:

1.  How detailed do you want the ""rolls supporting DPR information"".....I ask because we have about 40 individual rolls which constitute our DPR info.  Do they just want a print-out from Excel of each of these rolls?!

2.  All PRMA info needs to come from Accounting (Tracy Greene)

3.  What are they classifying as an ""open"" transaction?!  If you let me know how they are differentiating between an ""open"" and an ""active"" transaction, I can possibly have our IT guys run a script to get a number in an efficient manner.

4.  We can get you the number of books and commercial support people

5.  Average number of transactions per day can possibly be obtained from someone in the EOL group (and then simply extrapolated to obtain a number representing our complete population of deals) as EOL constitutes approximately 75% of the power trading activity

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
Casey

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

I have a small revision to make to our Power testing.  We will actually be testing the DPR macros for power because they will be using the application in the Estate world.  Has the specific database been determined that we will need to point the macros to for Estate?  I can have our IT support (Min Zheng) work on it today for me if we have all the information determined.

Subject: Today's Integration Test


Today' s integration test went very well. During testing we identified the following:

additional system dependencies 
additional application steps 
problem areas related to being in a production environment

We accomplished a lot this week and could not have done it without everyone's cooperation and hard work.


 
Thank You!
 
We will update the scripts, schedule and contact list, by end of day, to reflect any changes identified during today's  'Dry Run'. The new versions will be located in \\O:\_Dropbox\IntegrationTestScripts <file://\\O:\_Dropbox\IntegrationTestScripts>
 
Tomorrow we will publish a contact number and tentative schedule for Sunday's Integration Test.
 
Just a reminder, for those individuals who participated in the testing, please clean up (zero out, un-officialize, etc.), do not kill the deal, the following deals in Sitara, TAGG, EnPower, Unify PM, Unify VM, Unify Settlements, CAS and ?????:
 
    Sitara: 1193642, 1193649
    TAGG: YM5545.1, YM5709.1
    EnPower: 896012, 896014, 896015

I agree with Rogers.   Because only one entity can mark curves and I have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market, it makes sense for Netco/UBS to mark curves until the cutover occurs.   At that point, both entities will assume separate responsibility.

Subject:	Curve Marks thru 2/4 (maybe 2/5)

Kevin/Paul -

Apparently the new/separate curve database will not be copied until Monday 2/4.  Therefore, we need to decide who will be responsible for marking curves until such time.

Over the last few days our group has attempted to mark curves but has not been able to because the Netco group is still performing this function (in most cases).  My suggestion is that Netco employees continue to mark curves until the new database is completed.  At that time, there will be two separate processes.  The Enron estate process will only be marking curves where we have live (not terminated) positions including vol positions.

In the meantime, our group will be focusing on validation of the 11/30 and 12/03 curves as well as any other dates that will be crucial for termination calculation purposes.  We will need access to all back-up curve data captured during these time periods.

Please let me know if you agree.

Rogers

To: Evans, Casey; Evans, Casey
Subject: A plan to complete the ""J9"" issue


Casey,
 
A plan to complete the ""J9"" issue has been reached.
 
Basically, the solution is based on the following key point:
The number that is used to correct ""J9"" is from ""Swap Liq.xls"".  
 
Swap Liq.xls procedures and functions are: 
1: manually Via PortCol to ftp two files to local PC 
2 gets a comparison result between a pare of swap liq under the same region/book based on the two files
 
The design for this project is:
1: to save time, AUTOMATICALLY/DIRECTLY AND  WITHOUT Via PortCol  to ftp all files to a M Folder. The files are belonged to a giving portfolio and date 
2. compare Swap Liq for all pair files (for every pair,  the comparison result  just is exact as current ""Swap Liq.xls"")
3. if a difference is found from a pair files,  then value in ""J9"" in the desk tab and the region roll file will be changhed to ""J9 minus the number"" and the number also will be put in the column based on the date
4. the partially or all of above procedures may with or separate from DprAutomation if there is necessary
 
I need confirm with you about EXACTLY PROCEDURE about HOW TO GET THE NUMBER FROM ""Swap Liq.xls"" to  correct ""J9"". One of the macros will basically functions the way you give to me.
 
Also what is the title for new column in roll file for Swap Liq. 
 
The short term goal for this project is to try to make J9 work at the correct way under acceptable time period (in 20 minutes for a portfolio) before Netco starts trading. Long term goal will be speed and better interface or even reach a solution to take care this once for all from AdHoc database table. 
 
Please let me know when you have chance to guide me through/or e-mail the procedure about how to get the number to correct J9.
 
Please let me know if there is any concern. 
 
Thank you very much!
 
Min Zheng

Fran,

All deals from EOL are mapped to a desk in EnPower following these rules:

There cannot be more than one desk for any combination of
Trader
Region
Nature (Phys/Fin)

Therefore, you can have a trader with different books, so long as either the Region or Nature is different.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Legal Kill
By Alan Keyes

For a reason I will mention below, this past week was a most appropriate
time to focus again on the nature of the evil that struck America on
Sept. 11.

The terrorist destruction of that day was evil in many ways, but at the
heart of its evil was the deliberate deadly assault on innocent human
life. The root of the word ""innocent"" reveals that the notion of
innocence is connected to harmlessness. An innocent person is a person
who does no harm. And we see immediately that there is a special quality
of wickedness in premeditated violence against such people.

Camp X-Ray Allegations Lack Substance
By Carol Devine-Molin

Never mind that initial reports circulating within the UK regarding Camp
X-Ray prison conditions were unverified and patently fallacious. That
did not stop the British tabloids from reveling in a full-fledged media
frenzy in recent days, spewing sensational headlines proclaiming
so-called ""torture"" and ""inhumane"" treatment of the 158 Taliban and
al-Qaeda fighters being held at Camp X-Ray, located within the US Navy
Base at Guantanamo Bay, just outside of Cuba. Sadly, European
""America-bashing"" has reared its ugly head once again, and is now
accompanied by similar odious sentiments from some quarters in our own
nation.

The Philosophic Foundation for Politics
By SARTRE

At the risk of disturbing the slumber of the lethargic, the case in
favor of politics needs to be made. With the distraction that passes for
understanding, few have a grasp on the nature of social relations.
Politics is normally defined as the activities or affairs of government.
But it really is the art of human relations, applied to the organization
of society. The basis for government grows out of the perceived need to
establish order. Rules are the results of a desire to construct a road
map for society to function. The confusion that litters the highways,
rests upon a false understanding of how those arteries are constructed
and where they are going. The philosophy of politics can supply the
answer.

Morality has Tanked Around the World
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Let me see if this can be put as bluntly as possible ... tact isn't my
specialty anyway.

When sex and sex activities, straight or perverted, dominate a culture,
that culture is on its way to the sewer, washing all the people involved
with it (and sweeping along those who protested) into the vast
wastewaters of the planet.

Time to Go
By Timothy Rollins

In what can only be described as time to go, former Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Colin Powell has shown that
he is (a), too much a soldier, (b), not enough a diplomat or statesman,
and (c), a liability when it comes to the handling of the 158 detainees
that are currently being held at the United States Naval Base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Their current situation as to their being handled
was well described my friend and colleague Robert Yoho in his column
last Friday, which I would recommend highly for your reading.

Airport Security: Top Down? Or Bottom Up?
By Douglas Brown

When I opened the Lincoln Log set with my five-year old daughter, she
immediately grabbed the brightly colored green roof. She demanded that I
start building the log fort as depicted on the container from the top
down. My first attempt to follow her orders brought a puzzled look. My
second attempt brought an angry scowl. My final attempt brought a
giggling reproach for being so silly.

The tendency to want to do things from the top down is not limited to
five-year olds. It is also the preferred method of problem solving in
Washington, D.C.

There is a report in PortCalc - Hypothetical Curve Shift (Monthly) - that I would like someone to review for accuracy.  It is meant to have price increments that indicate what curve shift would have been had the curve been adjusted by that increment.  In order for this report to be generated, you have to choose the Hypothetical Curve Shift option in PortCalc (see below)

Sorry to be such a pest, but I'm still not crystal clear.

Should the west desk update in ""Schedule"" all transactions that flowed in December?
_____	Yes
_____	No

If yes, when do we need to have it done by?

Tim,

John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Subject:	January Settlements

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

Shona,

Please let us know what information for Power you are not able to obtain from other sources, and we will proceed with pulling the information.  We are currently overloaded with requests from both the estate side and the netco side so we would not be able to fulfill the entire request immediately.

Thanks.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

"NETCO access to RisktRAC","Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.  In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).  With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.  I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.  Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).  As such, I recommend the following: 

In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.

How does that sound?

after thinking about the schedule from Barry, I think that the following schedule is the one that should be completed.  I believe that this schedule will provide more information about what items may be more recoverable than others.  Also it will help ask questions as to what we really believe on recovery values. If you have any questions, please call.

Also who has information on ECTRIC?

"FW: Deal Entry Is In Stage and Is Ready For Testing","Tim,

Could you simply log into testp on Friday and just pull up a few of the deal type entry screens and just make sure things look ""okay"".  They made a change in the Australian database (see below), but they just want to make sure it doesn't affect East.

Thanks.
Casey

A new deal entry screen was added for Australia.  It's just like the Basis Option screen except that  there will be only 1 pub code entered.  I had to go to the Australian database to test the change.  I just want to insure that nothing was affected from your point of view.

Thanks Casey,

Ladies,
A new version of Deal Entry with a change for Australia has been moved to stage.  I have gotten concurrence from the West (Kate Symes) stating that it is ok.  I need to insure that on our side no changes have been made that impact you.  Will you please test version 3.0.0.210 at your earliest convenience to verify that.

Thank you,

Do you have the skills you need to get a good job?
If you want to secure your future, you need training.
http://links.quinstreet.com/adclick?area=fensuihagunduo
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 19 is:

jitney   \JIT-nee\   (noun)
     : a small bus that serves a regular route on a flexible
schedule

Example sentence:
     Guests at the hotel could ride from its parking lot to the
beach in a battered jitney that seated 15 comfortably, but that
held 20 or more on most trips.

Did you know?
     Jitneys weren't worth a dime -- just a nickel. In the early
1900s, ""jitney"" was slang for ""nickel,"" but it wasn't long before
the term was applied to a new mode of public transportation that
only cost a nickel. When they were introduced in American cities
at the beginning of the century, vehicular jitneys could be any
automobiles that carried passengers over a set route for a cheap
fare, but eventually the term was applied specifically to small
buses that charged a nickel for a ride.

Subject:	New Factor Loadings Have Been Run

All -

New factor loadings were run today (effective date 16-October-2001).

Attached is the VaR file which demonstrates the effect on VaR utilizing 16-October positions/prices/vols.

You may check the before and after factor loadings using the web link (test website) at:	http://rac.dev.corp.enron.com/rmc/MarketRiskApps.asp
Factor loading definition IDs are 2068 for the current factor and 2108 for the new one.

You may check correlations using RisktRAC's Data Grabber.
Correlation definition IDs are 1780 for the current factor and 1800 for the new one.

Implementation:	David has expressed his desire that analysis and the decision whether to implement factor loadings be completed within 24 hours; in other words by end of day Thursday.  If a decision is made not to implement, analysis should be provided indicating the reason (rather than ""need more time"").

Contact:		Frank Hayden in Houston at x58341 (or E-Mail him) as I will be out of the office tomorrow and Friday

Subject:	Argentina Interest Rate Change Impact on Power

Julian and Remi,

Attached is a file summarizing the impact of changing the interest rate from AA Libor to the Argentina Interest Rate curve Sassa sent me.  The impact is about
$357,000 positive.
  
Regarding the gas, I estimated the change out through Dec 06 and left the curve unchanged for the remainder of the duration of the deals (Cerro).  The impact is about ($95,000) negative.  Of course, with the gas book, the change would require system changes and for us to stop giving the cash flows to Gary Hickerson's group to hedge.  Changing the gas book is going to require a clarification of the Rho & Drift issues.  I thought we were there with Brazil but Pushkar only put the curve out for one year.  This of course does not allow us to use their curve for valuation as we have positions out through 2011 with Cisframa.

Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Dear All, 

        After the Windows Accounts migration tonight, our UBS traders will not be able to access the Estate EnPower Curve Manager. We are going to copy all the existing Curve data and files from the Estate to the UBS servers tonight. This would be the Final copy, so the UBS Curve data is considered Production data.

        Starting tomorrow, please let the Estate Traders mark the Estate Curves, and UBS traders mark the UBS Production curves.

        Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 and 10:00AM 2/5/2002. 

        UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002. 

        Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns. 

        Regards, 


Norman. 

PS. Kathy, please contact Min if you need help on Alberta's Excel Position Managers ( Curve) files.

TXU would like to close out all of their positions, and have finally provided us with their view of MTM and other charges for physical and financial power and gas for EPMI, ENA, EES and Enron Canada.  Would each of you please provide me with corresponding Enron numbers for your respective areas.  Michelle, as you will see, there is an item under ENA titled ""other"" - is this something from your area?  Elizabeth - given the net amount they owe us ($114,751,812.) if we can agree on numbers, can we take this as a one off item to the bankruptcy judge?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Carl,

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

thanks

Subject: A plan to complete the ""J9"" issue


Casey,
 
A plan to complete the ""J9"" issue has been reached.
 
Basically, the solution is based on the following key point:
The number that is used to correct ""J9"" is from ""Swap Liq.xls"".  
 
Swap Liq.xls procedures and functions are: 
1: manually Via PortCol to ftp two files to local PC 
2 gets a comparison result between a pare of swap liq under the same region/book based on the two files
 
The design for this project is:
1: to save time, AUTOMATICALLY/DIRECTLY AND  WITHOUT Via PortCol  to ftp all files to a M Folder. The files are belonged to a giving portfolio and date 
2. compare Swap Liq for all pair files (for every pair,  the comparison result  just is exact as current ""Swap Liq.xls"")
3. if a difference is found from a pair files,  then value in ""J9"" in the desk tab and the region roll file will be changhed to ""J9 minus the number"" and the number also will be put in the column based on the date
4. the partially or all of above procedures may with or separate from DprAutomation if there is necessary
 
I need confirm with you about EXACTLY PROCEDURE about HOW TO GET THE NUMBER FROM ""Swap Liq.xls"" to  correct ""J9"". One of the macros will basically functions the way you give to me.
 
Also what is the title for new column in roll file for Swap Liq. 
 
The short term goal for this project is to try to make J9 work at the correct way under acceptable time period (in 20 minutes for a portfolio) before Netco starts trading. Long term goal will be speed and better interface or even reach a solution to take care this once for all from AdHoc database table. 
 
Please let me know when you have chance to guide me through/or e-mail the procedure about how to get the number to correct J9.
 
Please let me know if there is any concern. 
 
Thank you very much!
 
Min Zheng

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 25 is:

corybantic   \kor-ee-BAN-tik or kahr-ee-BAN-tik\   (adjective)
     : like or in the spirit of a Corybant; especially : wild,
frenzied

Example sentence:
     Thousands of corybantic fans writhed and screamed in a
frenzied dance to the driving guitars and the pounding beat of
the rock band ""Steel Sweat.""

Did you know?
     The big name in goddesses in Phrygia (Asia Minor) in the
fifth century B.C. was Cybele (also called Cybebe or Agdistis),
the ""Great Mother of the Gods."" According to Oriental and Greco-
Roman mythology, she was the mother of it all -- gods, humans,
animals, plants, nature itself. The Corybants were Cybele's
mythical attendants, and they worshipped her with an unrestrained
frenzy of wildly emotional processions, rites, and dances.
""Corybantic,"" the adjective based on the name of Cybele's
attendants, can be used to describe anything characterized by a
similar unrestrained abandon.

"logy: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
What's another word for snowball? Watch your vocabulary
snowball with Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/thesaur/thes.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 29 is:

logy   \LOH-ghee\   (adjective)
     : marked by sluggishness and lack of vitality : groggy

Example sentence:
     The climbers began to feel logy and disoriented from the
combination of the high altitude and the energy they had
expended during the climb.

Did you know?
     Based on surface resemblance, you might guess that ""logy""
(also sometimes spelled ""loggy"") is related to ""groggy,"" but
that's not the case. ""Groggy"" comes from ""Old Grog,"" the
nickname of an English admiral who was notorious for his cloak
made of a fabric called grogram, and for adding water to his
crew's rum. The sailors called the rum mixture ""grog"" after the
admiral. Because of the effect of grog, ""groggy"" came to mean
""weak and unsteady on the feet or in action."" No one is really
sure about the origin of ""logy"", but experts speculate that it
comes from the Dutch word ""log,"" meaning ""heavy."" Its first
recorded use in English, from an 1847 London newspaper, refers
to a ""loggy stroke"" in rowing.

TXU would like to close out all of their positions, and have finally provided us with their view of MTM and other charges for physical and financial power and gas for EPMI, ENA, EES and Enron Canada.  Would each of you please provide me with corresponding Enron numbers for your respective areas.  Michelle, as you will see, there is an item under ENA titled ""other"" - is this something from your area?  Elizabeth - given the net amount they owe us ($114,751,812.) if we can agree on numbers, can we take this as a one off item to the bankruptcy judge?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Carl,

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Min Zheng

Do you have the skills you need to get a good job?
If you want to secure your future, you need training.
http://links.quinstreet.com/adclick?area=fensuihagunduo
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 21 is:

impervious   \im-PER-vee-us\   (adjective)
     1 *a : not allowing entrance or passage : impenetrable
b : not capable of being damaged or harmed
     2 : not capable of being affected or disturbed

Example sentence:
     ""The church's thick stone walls seemed to be impervious to
noise. . . ."" (_Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_, August 26, 2001)

Did you know?
     The English language is far from impervious, and of course,
a great many Latinate terms have entered it throughout its
history. ""Impervious"" is one of the many that broke through in
the 17th century. It comes from the Latin ""impervius,"" and it
has many relatives in English. ""Impervius"" adds the prefix ""im-""
to ""pervius,"" which means ""passable"" or ""penetrable"" (and is
the source of the relatively uncommon English word ""pervious"").
""Pervius"" itself comes from two smaller Latin forms: ""per-,""
meaning ""through,"" and ""via,"" meaning ""way."" Among the many
""per-"" derivatives are ""persevere,"" ""pervade"" and ""percolate.""
From ""via,"" we have ""trivial,"" ""deviate,"" and many others.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

"RE: Dec and Jan liquidations","Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

"glom: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Did you know Julius Caesar moved January to the head
of the year? Click here for your guide to word histories.
http://www.m-w.com/book/literead/wordhist.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 8 is:

glom   \GLAHM\   (verb)
    *1 : take, steal
     2 : seize, catch

Example sentence:
     ""Nobody needs to glom my favorite hairbrush anymore,"" Liz
told her three teenage daughters, ""now that I've bought each of
you one just like it.""

Did you know?
     It's a classic case of glomming. Americans seized on
""glaum"" (a term from Scots dialect that basically means ""grab"")
and appropriated it as our own, changing it to ""glom"" in the
process. ""Glom"" first meant ""steal"" (as in the purse-snatching,
robber kind of stealing), but over time that meaning got
stretched. Today, ""glom"" often figuratively extends that original
""steal"" sense. A busy professional might glom a weekend getaway,
for example. ""Glom"" also appears frequently in the phrase ""glom
on to,"" which can mean ""to appropriate for one's own use"" (""glom
on to another's idea""); ""to grab hold of"" (""glom on to the last
cookie""); or ""to latch on to"" (""glom on to an opinion"" or ""glom
on to an influential friend"").

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  I'm pleased to report that our nation
continues to takeimportant steps in the war against terrorism.  Next
week, the House of Representativeswill be voting on an airline security
bill that Congressman Don Young has introduced.

It was modeled after proposals I made last month.  Under the Young bill,
the federalgovernment will assume complete control of airport security
and screening.  It alsogreatly expands the Federal Air Marshal program,
and provides substantial new fundingfor secure cockpits and other
security measures aboard airplanes.

There's a critical difference between the Young bill and the bill the
Senate passed a fewweeks ago.  My approach gives the government the
flexibility it needs to assemble askilled and disciplined screening work
force.

Permanent Principles of Liberty
By Alan Keyes

Our current national travails have provoked much talk of a new spirit of
""trusting government."" Certainly, it is important and desirable that the
citizens of a nation at war have confidence and trust in their
government. We should be mindful, however, that this need for trust cuts
both ways.  War tends necessarily to increase the concentration of power
in the federal government, and particularly in the executive branch.

In a free republic, such times as war increase as well the necessity
that citizens trust their own judgment. Even as we willingly accept the
increased energy of the government in those areas where it is truly
necessary, we must increase as well our vigilant insistence that
government power respect the permanent principles of liberty. The
particular danger in times of war or crisis is that the legitimate need
for energetic government action will provide cover for those who, from
vice or ignorance, seek to expand government power at the expense of the
very liberty which it is government's purpose to secure.

Torturing Terrorists For Information?
By Carol Devine-Molin

Recent media reports indicate that the FBI is frustrated, noting
difficulties in extracting information from approximately 150 suspected
terrorists that remain in custody pursuant to the September 11th  ""Day
of Infamy"". Among the many zipped-mouthed individuals, there is detainee
Zacarias Moussaoui, a Moroccan national with close ties to the 9/11
hijackers and allegedly key in the current investigation. How should the
FBI address this thorny predicament of silent suspects?  Interestingly,
the idea of resorting to ""torture"" of suspects is being publicly floated
at this juncture, which should give us pause. This is possibly a public
relations ""trial balloon"" by the government, in order to calibrate
American response to what may become an unsavory reality of war, and to
""psychologically inoculate"" Americans before accounts begin to surface.

Empowerment, Not Enfeeblement: The Citizen Response to Terrorism
By Gregg Bish

Our nation is wrapped in a deep, emotionally wrought debate over
controlling terrorism. Nightly talk television programs are filled,
start to finish, over individuals and organizations advocating
everything from outright racial profiling directed at Arab appearing
individuals to hiring thirty thousand federal shock police to stand post
at the luggage check-in and security portals. The Bill of Rights
trembles in its very frame at the stampede of good intentions and short
wit directed its way.

It can be expected that following any trauma, the public will respond
with its emotions showing sharply on its sleeve. Following the events of
September 11, the American public is responding clothed in panic. Such
are these good intentioned and feeble minded suggestions on how our
government ought to deal with terrorism, a tunic of fear.

The 'Loyalist Tale' - American Tories
By SARTRE

""I voluntarily take this OATH to bear Faith and true Allegiance to His
MAJESTY KING George the Third; - and defend to the utmost of my Power,
His sacred Person, Crown and Government, against all Persons
whatsoever.""

Words like these may seem strange to inhabitants of the twenty first
century, but to citizenry of the revolutionary period, this was the
making of serious discourse. Just hollow rhetoric, or was this sentiment
of the day, a fair reflection by a significant portion of the
population?

The UN Speaks
By Dorothy Anne Seese

The United Nations wants the US to cease hostilities in Afghanistan
until it can get water, food and supplies to the people, particularly
the children.  Oh my here we go.  I don't recall the UN issuing any
mandates to the terrorists, whoever they are, or their supporting
nations, to halt terrorist attacks on the US, including bioterrorism,
until they could make sure no American children would be harmed.

Who Are the Heroes?
By Star Parker

During these difficult times, it is beautiful and energizing for me to
watch my fellow Americans refocus on the powerful principles that
makeour country so great. I know, as I see the flags flying and the red,
white, and blue lapel pins now widely sported, that we are indeed a
nation under God, exalting and realizing the will of the Creator as each
of us fulfill our unique destinies as free men and women.

Yet, in the midst of this, I am also saddened and dismayed by things I
am hearing from some of my fellow citizens and from some of our allies'
abroad. What type of thinking could conclude that the horrendous,
murderous act that occurred on September 11th can be justified in any
way and that somehow, this grotesque behavior is our fault? What type
ofthinking could possibly conclude that a cowardly act, resulting in the
murder of innocent men, women, and children, is religious or heroic?

"RE: volatility","Hi Stacey:

  Thanks for the background and insight information.  

  For weekly options, if there is any, we are still using the monthly-daily blending formula, there's no different blending rules applied right now.  

  From your email, I get it that for all deal types in East portfolio, no blending should be applied, this includes deals whose expiry frequency is embedded in the deal type but not explicitly specified (such as transmission deals) in deal entry.  If this understanding is correct, we'll need to make code changes, please let us know if we should start implementing that or wait till after the meeting.

  Thanks,

Subject:	RE: volatility

The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  

	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.

	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.

	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.

	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.

Clarification 1,  I haven't come to East Power last March.  Therefore, the change must not be my request.
Clarification 2,  I like the change.
Clarification 3,  I do NOT have concerns about the difference itself, but it is scary that people (i.e., myself) don't know the difference exits.  I think your summary below is very valuable and I would like to make sure Risk team and other relevant people be aware of it.

Hi Hai:

  Here's the logic about volatility.  Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility.  From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option.    The implication of that is that for 

1. other portfolios,
2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now),
3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined,

the blend approach will still be applied.  Please let us know if you have any concerns.

"RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)","
The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

This deal is expected to close this Friday and therefore Friday will be the last day that we calculate all of the Enron Direct books, for both gas and power.  On Monday we will officialize a blank calc.  We will not be able to actually calculate a blank book on Monday because to remove all the deals from the book Jan 26th forward is not feasable. The p&l from Enron Direct Canada accrues to ECC till Friday as well.

For any deals between ECC and Enron Direct Canada we will be changing Enron Direct Canada to Enmax.

Once there is a closing agreement with all conditions primarily met I do not believe there is any need to continue calculating the Enron Direct books (both the gas and power books).  I anticipate that I will know more about the closing conditions late next week.  ECC's deals with Enron Direct Canada will now become deals between ECC and Enmax, and should be treated as third party credit risk.  These deals have not been terminated.

I'll let you know when we intend to stop calcing these books.  Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Subject:	risk books for December

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks

It is just that the short names are EPMI-EAST-PERF  and EPMIWESPER ( not  EPMI-WEST-PERF )

Subject:	risk books for December

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

"RE: Liquidations","The last thing was in ref to that email Tim sent back to you. I just spoke with Diana Scholtes regarding the updating. She has spent 2 hours working on the 6th and has run into numerous problems. There are some counterparties which have terminated with us that are still scheduled. She has talked to Will regarding this and he said it may be Monday before that can be corrected. The real time position manager and scheduling are very slow. They are using these to make sure they are flat. Bottom line is that this is a losing battle and Monday deadline doesn't look good.

John - Not even the Dec #'s are done yet?  I believe they are planning on mass drafting Monday, so whatever is in the system at this time will go to Unify.  We might as well match Unify even if it is wrong, I guess.

Leslie - thoughts?

The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?

What is your status on liquidations? I noticed that you are looking at the fin liq report, etc. Are you running the Max Exp and liq rec even though the liquidations for Dec are not final? 

Stacey, should we have also set up the Orig trading book? Should we have included that in the book requests?

"benefic: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Enjoy a year's worth of poems, puns, and puzzles in
The Best of an Almanac of Words at Play.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/puzzspec/wordplay.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for February 2 is:

benefic   \buh-NEH-fik\   (adjective)
     : of, having, or exerting a favorable or beneficent
influence

Example sentence:
     Simone believes that her meditation practice is a benefic
force in her life, helping her to focus and to find inner peace.

Did you know?
     ""Benefic"" comes from Latin ""bene facere,"" meaning ""to do
good to."" The word was originally used by astrologers to refer
to celestial bodies believed to have a favorable influence, and
it's still used in astrological contexts. ""Benefic,"" ""beneficent,""
and ""beneficial"" are all synonyms, but there are shades of
difference. ""Beneficial"" usually applies to things that promote
health or well-being (as ""beneficial treatment""), or that
provide some benefit or advantage (as in ""beneficial classes"").
""Beneficent"" means doing or effecting good (as ""a beneficent
climate""), but in particular refers to the performance of acts
of kindness or charity (as ""a beneficent organization"").
""Benefic,"" the rarest of the three, tends to be a bit high-flown,
and it's mostly used to describe a favorable power or force.

Jennifer Stevenson at Andersen may be calling you all to try and verify something to assist us with our dual trigger accounting arguments.  We have been trying to prove to Andersen that the value in the dual trigger option lies more in the price volatility than the physical plant outage.  AA was perplexed by the approximate 50% margin on these deals.  Larry Marcus pointed out to them that this isn't any different than an out of the money call option which would also typically generate a 50% margin.  They believe that it will greatly help our argument if they can verify with a trader that this is true.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: status of CCO book accounting treatment


if a call option is way out of the money, such as the ones we purchased last summer, the premium is a multiple of the ""expected"" payout.  a trader may not respond well to the term ""margin"" because they dont calculate it. as an example, if the midmarket value for a $100 power call is $2.50, and a $500 call is expected to pay 40% as much, a trader would offer this illiquid instrument for $2, which would be like a 50% margin.  one problem with this analogy is that expected value of payout is frequently much lower than the midmarket because there are very few arbitrageurs in this market who can really take advantage of that.  this example does support the statement, but a trader will not think about it the same way.  they will not call this extreme vol smile on illiquid products a high margin.  harry arora would be the trader to talk to.

Patty / Jennifer want to confirm your statement that a 50% margin on an out-of-the-money call option is not unusual.  They have asked Stacey White (Director of Power Risk Mgmt) to recommend a power trader with whom they can talk.  If you know of a person you would like them to talk with, please let me know.
 
Mary Cilia (transaction support) has asked Jennifer and Patty not to push the issue with Tom Bauer until he is in a more receptive mood.  We are still anticipating a resolution this quarter.   I will continue to keep you informed.

Subject: NETCO



The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- 

(i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  

        The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     
(ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                                To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 
(iii)   Seating Plans                                                           Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. 

Happy New Year 

Louise

If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.

Thanks,
Stacey

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"RE: Terminated Transactions Reconciliation between Master Log, Power Physical spreadsheet, and Other","
Stacey,

I have reviewed the section on the attachment of counterparties on the master log with a ""Y"" but not on the physical power terminated list.  BP Energy Company is on the physical power terminated list.  With the exception of the four new companies that appeared on the master list today and Ameren, we do not have any trades flowing after December 1, 2001 with the other counterparties.  I have not been including counterparties on the list if we don't have any deals flowing December 2001 on out.  If I need to include companies that we don't have outstanding trades with let me know.

Niagara Mohawk has been purchased by Select Energy New York, Inc.  Tonight Global Counterparty is going to replace the Niagara Mohawk name with Select Energy New York, Inc.  I have been waiting on global before adding Select to the termination list.  I have not heard back on Ameren yet.

Once I have an answer from David on the other terminations (by alternate source) I will let you know.

Thanks for organizing the information from all of the e-mails.

Let me know if you need anything else.  I will be sending an updated physical power termination list today.

Thanks,
Melissa

David,
Just to make sure you know, the Power Physical Terminated Transactions spreadsheet, is put together by Melissa from information she has received from Master Log and other.  This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades.

Subject:	Interest Rate Curves

Hi,

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

James

I'm not in love with square root of 10, I prefer a simulation.  If the best idea is the square root multiplication, please let it be so.  I suggest using the up 99 field to saved the result in.  This way we can start tracking it in database.
Thanks,
Frank

All, The majority of instruments are swaps so that should not be a problem.  Delta-Gamma is a problem mainly for OTM options.
10-days is OK and standard for Delta-Gamma.  It is problematic for times greater than a month or more.

Everyone,

If we do 10 days VaR, then people may challenge our delta-gamma methodology.  With the high volatility of energy market and the long time horizon, delta-gamma method may not be appropriate anymore.

As I said before, if we don't have too many option deals, just multiply square root of 10 (for 10-days VaR) to one day VaR.  If we do have lot option deals, then our current delta-gamma approach may not be good either.

Regards,

Winston

NETCO, if partnered with an ibank will require VaR over a ten day holding period so this is a change we would need to make anyway

Frank,
We are going through a very difficult task of splitting hardware, software,licenses across NETCO and estate. There are massive database transitions in progress and testing scheduled on the new environments on both sides. Database or program changes at this point are very difficult.

If Nilay can come up with the changes and the impact on existing programs, we can see how we can fit these in. But right now our priorities are to cleanup data for NETCO, carry out testing for such a condition and make sure all systems function appropriately on Estate.

Regards,
Ramesh

It appears that we may start developing a pattern of assuring that our positions/curves are correct to the best of knowledge/ability, either  weekly or twice monthly.  This being the case (Jeff and Stacey, please let me if weekly is a correct statement, say Friday?) we will need to enhance our daily VAR calculations with a longer holding period reflecting our ""best calc"" time frame.  

In English, this means that we need to start measuring VAR for a 5 day or 10 day holding period, pending Jeff and Stacey feedback.  What Risktrac needs to do regarding this business practice is report VAR for the longer holding period.  Due to the portfolio having gamma exposures, we cannot simply multiply everything by the square-root of time.  I suggest that in the RiskTrac system, we offer another box, in addition to the historical VAR box, a box for longer tenor.  I recognize this requires some alterations, but with scaled back business perhaps it won't be extremely difficult.

Additionally, this doesn't mean that we stop the daily/nightly functions we've been doing since the dawn of time, but it does mean that once a week we have a very high confidence that our books reflect our ""reality"" the way we understand it.

Bad idea? Feedback?

Thanks,
Frank

Tom,

For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select ""commodity"" only as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as they are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should query by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (region codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not energy positions, per se:

10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)

Let me know if you have any questions!
Casey

Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the ""contacts"" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.

       At  first I rolled my eyes....then I read Dave's

        After September 11th there are 111 days left to the end of the

        119 is the area code to Iraq/Iran. 1 + 1 + 9 = 11

        Flight 77 - 65 on board - 6 + 5 = 11


       Dave's response:

       Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11
       letters in the name ""David Pawson!""
       I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a
       few weeks.

        Wait a sec ... just realized ""YOU CAN'T HIDE"" also
        has 11 letters!
        What am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after
        me! ME! I can't believe it!

        Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet
        Earth I could hide!
        But no ...""PLANET EARTH"" has 11 letters, too!

        Maybe Nostradamus can help me. But dare I trust
        him? There are 11 letters in  ""NOSTRADAMUS.""

        I know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't...
        11 letters in ""THE RED CROSS ,"" can't trust them.

        I would rely on self defense, but ""SELF DEFENSE""
        has 11 letters in it, too!
        Can someone help?

        Anyone? If so, send me email. No, don't... ""SEND
        ME EMAIL"" has 11 letters....

        Will this never end? I'm going insane! ""GOING
        INSANE???"" Eleven letters!!

        Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even
        though ""I'LL DIE ALONE"" has 11 letters.....

        Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed!

"melange: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Did you know Julius Caesar moved January to the head
of the year? Click here for your guide to word histories.
http://www.m-w.com/book/literead/wordhist.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 7 is:

melange   \may-LAHNZH or may-LAHNJ\   (noun)
     : a mixture often of incongruous elements

Example sentence:
     Critics panned the new film as an awkward melange of heavy
drama, zany comedy, and overblown special effects.

Did you know?
     ""Melange"" got mixed into the melting pot of English back
in the 1600s. It derives from the Middle French verb ""mesler,""
which means ""to mix."" ""Melange"" is actually one of many French
contributions to the English body of words for miscellaneous
mixtures. ""Pastiche"" (meaning ""a composition made up of
selections of different works,"" or broadly, ""a disorderly
mixture, hodgepodge"") is borrowed from French, and ""medley,""
""potpourri,"" and ""hodgepodge"" all have roots in French too.
There's also the lesser known ""gallimaufry"" (meaning
""hodgepodge""), which comes from the Middle French ""galimafree""
(meaning ""stew"").

Enjoy a year's worth of poems, puns, and puzzles in
The Best of an Almanac of Words at Play.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/puzzspec/wordplay.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 30 is:

impromptu   \im-PRAHMP-too or im-PRAHMP-tyoo\   (adjective)
    *1 : made, done, or formed on the spur of the moment
: improvised
     2 : composed or uttered without previous preparation
: extemporaneous

Example sentence:
     When we dropped by unexpectedly, Aunt Louise threw together
an impromptu dinner from the odds and ends in her refrigerator.

Did you know?
     If you think that ""impromptu"" looks like a relative of
""prompt,"" you're right; both are ultimately derived from the
Latin ""promere,"" meaning ""to bring forth, take out."" ""Impromptu""
was borrowed from French, where it meant ""extemporaneously,""
but French speakers picked it up from the Latin phrase ""in
promptu,"" a ""promere"" descendant meaning ""in readiness"" or ""at
hand."" There is also another, much rarer descendant of ""promere""
in English -- the noun ""promptuary,"" meaning ""a book of ready
reference.""

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Shona - 

A few points/questions on the request:

1.  How detailed do you want the ""rolls supporting DPR information"".....I ask because we have about 40 individual rolls which constitute our DPR info.  Do they just want a print-out from Excel of each of these rolls?!

2.  All PRMA info needs to come from Accounting (Tracy Greene)

3.  What are they classifying as an ""open"" transaction?!  If you let me know how they are differentiating between an ""open"" and an ""active"" transaction, I can possibly have our IT guys run a script to get a number in an efficient manner.

4.  We can get you the number of books and commercial support people

5.  Average number of transactions per day can possibly be obtained from someone in the EOL group (and then simply extrapolated to obtain a number representing our complete population of deals) as EOL constitutes approximately 75% of the power trading activity

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
Casey

Subject:	Food for thought

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.

"FW: Ancillary Curves","Casey,

I ran curve queries for the RIJ-N and R6W-Z ancillary curves we discussed the other day.  The queries showed that delta positions were captured for these ancillary curves, which goes against what we discussed yesterday - no VaR on ancillary positions.  (I assume that since we have positions that there is a VaR unless there's another workaround outside of the query) FYI - I used the curve grabber tool in the rac website.  

Please give me a call in the a.m. to discuss.

Frank,

The voicemail I left was regarding ancillary curves requested by John.  Burton may have emailed you on the request earlier.  I'm following up b/c he's out.

Question - Do we have a rule regarding whether or not we calculated VaR and capture positions for ancillary business?  Based on discussions with Casey Evans we don't report ancillary activity for her regions (var or positions).  In order to keep consistency across the business, it seems that we would either report all ancillary or none.  

Please advise.

Regards

KC

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 20 is:

blithesome   \BLYTHE-sum\   (adjective)
     : gay, merry

Example sentence:
     The celebration was a blithesome scene: men and women
dancing to the lively tunes of an impromptu band, children
running and playing, the air filled with joyous shouts and
laughter.

Did you know?
     ""Blithesome"" comes from ""blithe,"" a word that has been a
part of English since before the 12th century. ""Blithe"" can mean
""casual"" and ""heedless"" as well as ""joyful"" and ""lighthearted,""
but ""blithesome"" obviously makes use of only the ""joyful,
lighthearted"" sense. ""Blithesome"" didn't show up in print in
English until 1724, and is now relatively uncommon, but you'll
find it in the works of such authors as Charles Dickens, Sir
Walter Scott, Mark Twain, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Geneva Convention

Much is being made of the ""status"" of the terrorist prisoners currently
being held in Cuba.  There have been multiple references to the status
of prisoners of war as outlined by the Geneva Convention.

To help folks learn more about these discussions, GOPUSA now has the
Geneva III document available for viewing.  This document pertains
specifically to the treatment of prisoners of war.  We hope you find it
educational.

Be Still, America... I am God

Be Still, America is a collection of poignant, soul-healing stories told
in the aftermath of the horrific events of 9/11/01. Author Amy Bartlett,
who lives and works in New York City, shows how God was present in the
disaster -- even amid the ruin and the rubble.

A Brilliant Performance by a Great Leader
By David Horowitz

President Bush gave two speeches in his State of the Union address last
night, which I had the once in a lifetime privilege of viewing from the
gallery. The first was a war speech, the second a campaign speech. Both
were home runs.

The war speech was designed to firm America's resolve. It began with one
of the most powerful opening lines ever delivered on these occasions:
""As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war, our economy is in
recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the
state of our Union has never been stronger."" These were true words, a
tribute to the resilience and character of the American people, which
had been adrift during the last decade of misleadership by Bush's
predecessor.

Should Israel Take the Gloves Off?
By Linda Chavez

Lightning isn't supposed to strike twice in the same place, but tell
that to Mark Sokolow. Mr. Sokolow survived the attack on the World Trade
Center in September, barely escaping from his 38th floor office when the
second plane hit and the building collapsed. Then on Sunday, Sokolow and
his family were shopping in Jerusalem, where they had gone to visit a
daughter studying there, when a suicide bomber, a Palestinian female,
detonated a device that killed her and one other, and injured scores,
including Sokolow, his wife and two remaining daughters.

A Terrorist by Any Other Name
By Frederick Meekins

In response to the September 11th Attack upon America, the U.S.
government has vowed to wipe terrorism from the face of the earth.  To
some officials, this noble struggle might become nothing more than a
word game of shuffled papers and fluctuating definitions.

Wearing the 'Uniform' of War
By Austin Bay

Every Monday night, I put on my uniform and head for reserve drill.
However, it's not the uniform per se that makes me a ""part time""
American soldier.

Still, for folks with a knack for the obvious, when essaying the
applicability of Third Geneva Convention standards to a particular
prisoner, a uniform (or lack thereof) is a pretty darn good place to
start.

Hey Media, Leave The Kids Alone
By Mike Bayham

In 1964, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was asked to define
obscenity.  Justice Stewart then replied, ""I know it when I see it.""
 The same broad guidelines are used to determine what is newsworthy.

Many people during the late nineties began to ask the question of the
true newsworthiness of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.  Because Bill
Clinton's activities were central to a Federal investigation, the
location of the affair and that both participants were in their
political positions by their own choosing the national media felt
justified in relaying to the public the most precise details of the
affair.

When A Promise Is Not A Promise
By Thomas D. Segel

A promise is not a promise when it is given to members of the United
States Armed Forces by their leadership. A promise is not a promise when
the United States Congress can change its pledges into a different
message having no meaning. A promise is not a promise when less is given
than originally guaranteed.

*** Re: The GOP Abandons Its Pro-Life Platform (Bonnie Chernin Rogoff)

Thank you Bonnie Rogoff for speaking out on truths. We all need to raise
the volume, for we are all that is left to be heard. We must re-take the
principals of the Republican Party, and un-merge the right from the
left. Your article is a beginning step in the 'right' direction.
-- Judith Pratt, OK

I have to say that I agree that abortion is wrong, and anyone who does
so is a murderer. However, I believe that President Bush is doing the
best he can, and his ability is a great one. I think he is just waiting
for the right time to pick up the pro-life issue again. He doesn't want
to endanger re-election, and playing nice to the ""moderates"" and
liberals will help him get re-elected, and then he can start really
putting the pro-life message out.
-- Tony Lemaster

Hats off to Bonnie for having the courage to say we should cut off ""W""
for his shameful pandering to the leftist media by shunning the
Republican pro-life platform. In the time since thousands were killed by
the terrorists on 9/11, how many thousands of unborns have been killed
with the passive blessing of the establishment GOP - with Bush and
Ashcroft not lifting a finger to protect them?
-- Don Zimmerman

It's about time that Abortion is removed from the political process.
While I am not an advocate of abortion, I do not believe that it is a
Political concern. Antiabortionists within the Republican Party do not
represent me - and I AM A REPUBLICAN. I demonstrate that with my time,
my talents, my service and my money.
-- Dorothy Danfelser, Elephant Butte, NM

Thank you for the wonderful article about the GOP abandoning the
Pro-Life Platform. I've been very disappointed in the ""straddling the
fence posture"" that President George W. Bush has taken. I do not
doubt his beliefs for the unborn and the value of their life... I do
doubt his wisdom in ignoring and brushing aside the pro-life
conservatives who made his election to the Presidency possible.
-- Cheryl Williams, Edmond, OK

If the Republican Party does not recognize that there are thousands of
us, Pro-Choice Republicans, it will risk losing it's ability to win.
There are too many other issues that need Republican principles that
dividing the party is a disservice to the nation.
-- Rep. Harry Tipton, WY

*** Re: Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again (Dorothy Anne Seese)

This was excellent!! Thank you.
-- Kathi Palmer

Praise God!! I thoroughly enjoyed your column with the above title. You
have hit the proverbial nail on the head. Keep up the good work!
-- Michael Thompson, Republican for Congress

Ms. Seese misses the point with her moral fantasies about sex.  It is
suffering, human death, and other war-related activities that are
immoral, particularly when the victims are women and children.  War is
probably a non-natural activity, since primitive hunter-gatherers did
not engage in warfare with organized armies.  Sex and sexual pleasures
and their pursuit are entirely normal.

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

The Word of the Day for October 20 is:

innocuous   \ih-NAH-kyuh-wus\   (adjective)
     1 : producing no injury : harmless
    *2 : not likely to give offense or to arouse strong feelings
or hostility : inoffensive, insipid

Example sentence:
     Sally was surprised when her seemingly innocuous remark
enraged her classmates.

Did you know?
     ""Innocuous"" has harmful roots -- it comes to us from the
Latin adjective ""innocuus,"" which was formed by combining the
negative prefix ""in-"" with a form of the verb ""nocere,"" meaning
""to harm, hurt."" In addition, ""nocere"" gave us the truly
""harmful"" words ""noxious,"" ""nocent,"" and even ""nocuous.""
""Innocent"" is from ""nocere"" as well, although like ""innocuous,""
it has the ""in-"" prefix negating the hurtful possibilities.
""Innocuous"" first appeared in print in 1598 with the clearly
Latin-derived meaning ""harmless or causing no injury"" (as in
""an innocuous gas""). The second sense is a metaphorical
extension of the idea of injury, used to indicate that someone
or something does not cause hurt feelings, or even strong
feelings (""an innocuous book,"" ""innocuous issues"").

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Looking for a new kind of feeding frenzy? Feast on colorful
references in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions.

***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 10 is:

sotto voce   \sah-toh-VOH-chee\   (adverb or adjective)
     1 : under the breath : in an undertone; also : in a
private manner
    *2 : very softly -- used as a direction in music

Example sentence:
     At the beginning of the piece, Jessel sang sotto voce,
which made his loud, powerful ending all the more dramatic.

Did you know?
     It's no secret: in our example sentence, ""sotto voce""
functions as an adverb, modifying the past-tense verb ""sang.""
But ""sotto voce,"" which was borrowed into English from the
Italian term ""sottovoce"" (literally meaning ""under the voice""),
can also serve as an adjective. That's the role it plays in
the following sentence: ""Nora told Casey about the party in a
sotto voce whisper.""

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Subject:	Power Month End Procedures


In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

Amigos,
I was looking at our non-terminated financial deals and found these (in the spreadsheet).  Aside from the EES stuff, which I still don't know how to treat, do you think we could get rid of these intercompany trades.  I am happy to track down answers if there are questions about what we should be doing with them, but if it is a matter of just killing them or moving them to the Bankruptcy books, can you guys do that?
Thanks,
Kristin

"Bifurcation structure","Thanks for discussing the FPL structure today.

After talking to several of you, I think it is safe to say that the plant portion of the deal (non-firm) would have to be physical.  However, it does not have to be a separate entity (e.g. plantco).  It is possible that FPL could do the trade in their non-firm book, while the contingent call option part could be done in their derivative book.  This would simplify settling since ENA would only invoice the FPL non-firm book for mwh actually delivered.  

However, the contingent call would be financially settled easily.  If it is exercised, FPL would pay us index less $27.  Since this is not to be modeled or marketed as a swap, there is no fixed for float issue like that discussed this morning.  In other words, Enron has no downside if the plant is down AND mkt prices are below $27, except for the $3 it paid in premium.

I talked to the client and they are noodling on some other structures, so I will wait until I talk to them before I trouble you guys too much more about firming up this structure.

Thanks for your assistance so far.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

Regards,

Pete

"deem: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Looking for a new kind of feeding frenzy? Feast on colorful
references in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions.
http://www.m-w.com/book/writref/allusion.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 13 is:

deem   \DEEM\   (verb)
    *transitive sense : to come to think or judge : consider
     intransitive sense : to have an opinion : believe

Example sentence:
     Upon discovering that they had collected a combined total
of more than one thousand dollars, the students deemed their
class fund-raiser a resounding success.

Did you know?
     In the Middle Ages, ""demen"" was a fateful word. Closely
related to ""doom,"" this precursor of ""deem"" meant ""to act as a
judge"" or ""to sentence, condemn, or decree."" These meanings
passed to ""deem"" itself, but we haven't used ""deem"" to mean
""legally condemn"" since the early 17th century. Though ""deem""
is still frequently used in law contexts, today it means
""judge"" only in a broader sense of ""to decide (something
specified) regarding,"" as in ""the act was deemed unlawful""
or ""the defendant is deemed to have agreed to the contract.""
Outside of the law, ""deem"" usually means simply ""to consider.""
Some usage commentators consider ""deem"" pretentious, but its
use is well established in both literary and journalistic
contexts. We deem it perfectly acceptable.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Subject:	RE:  West Power Curve Shape

Right now in ZP26 there is very little demand and a lot of generation. Bob is expecting the demand to increase in 2002 for that area and generation will move along with it. His thinking is that prices will drop. The further you go out in time, he doesn't expect generation to keep as the demand continues to grow and so he is forecasting an increase in prices from around late 2005 out.

FYI, there are more changes coming to the reports. Tim was in Houston last week and John said he thinks the reports could be changed or improved. Tim wants to see certain changes and get rid of some reports that John had told you he wanted to see when we made the changes about a month ago. I told Tim that I am not doing anything until he talks to John about it and they both agree. I hate to say it but it is becoming somewhat comical these reports. So just a heads up that some changes we make may come back to the East as well.

""Rife"" is one of those words -- it's related to Middle Low German
""rive,"" meaning ""abundant."" Not a whole lot has changed with
""rife"" in its 900-year history. We continue to use the word, as
we have since the 12th century, for negative things, especially
those that are widespread or prevalent. Typical examples are
""shoplifting was rife"" or ""rife with misspelled words."" ""Rumors""
and ""speculation"" are frequently described as ""rife"" as well.
But ""rife"" can also be appropriately used, as it has been for
hundreds of years, for good or neutral things. For example, you
might speak of ""the summer garden, rife with scents.""

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

The Word of the Day for October 25 is:

Valhalla   \val-HAL-uh or vahl-HAHL-uh\   (noun)
      : the great hall in Norse mythology where the souls of
heroes slain in battle are received

Example sentence:
     The great war god Odin, with flowing beard and only one
eye, presided over the meals in Valhalla.

Did you know?
     In Norse mythology, the souls of warriors who died nobly
in battle were brought to a magnificent palace, where they spent
their days fighting for diversion, immune from lasting injury,
and their evenings lustily feasting on freshly killed boar and
quaffing freely-flowing mead. In Old Norse, the word for this
warrior heaven is ""Valholl"" (literally, ""hall of the slain"");
in German, it is ""Walhalla."" English speakers picked up the name
as ""Valhalla"" in the 18th century. Nowadays, we can use the word
figuratively, and induction or admission into a modern-day
Valhalla doesn't require passing from this life. It can be a
place of honor (a hall of fame, for example) or a place of bliss
(as in ""an ice cream lover's Valhalla"").

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Subject:	RE: quick question regarding EOL Administration

John,

Currently, there is no way we can meet this need.  The information we get from EOL does not include a desk id and we must determine the id based on the criteria given below.  

There are two possible solutions
1)  Add one or more other fields as criteria for determining the desk.
2)  Have EOL send the desk id in the bridge message.

Although I cannot speak for EOL IT, I suspect that solution 2 would be very involved.  I doubt that traders are even able to select a desk when creating a product in EOL.  Melba, can you verify this fact?

If option 1 is doable from a business perspective, we will need to discuss further the changes and timeline involved for IT.  This issues should be raise in the meeting with Steve Nat tomorrow.

Regards,
Will

Fran,

All deals from EOL are mapped to a desk in EnPower following these rules:

There cannot be more than one desk for any combination of
Trader
Region
Nature (Phys/Fin)

Therefore, you can have a trader with different books, so long as either the Region or Nature is different.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi, Duong Luu and Will:

We are trying to add Tim Belden in EOL Adminstration (under Enpower) to be the Trader of ""NETCO Long Term Southwest"" after I have added him as the trader for ""NETCO Long Term California"",  but I kept getting below error message:

ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_DEAL_DEFAULT_DESKS) violated


Is this because we cannot have any individual to be the trader of more than one west book?

Please advise. 

Thanks,

Fran

"FW:  IMPORTANT......Workstation Audits for move to ECS","

All,

Move time is fast approaching!!!!  IT will be performing a workstation audit on everyone who will be moving to ECS.  This audit is a physical audit of all your IT equipment (computer, telephone, printers, etc.) to document the equipment for each individual.  They will not be accessing the workstation in any way, nor will we power off any workstation.  

IT will begin the workstation audit Wednesday, October 17th around 6:00 pm and will continue for up to 4 consecutive nights (and/or this weekend) to ensure that we identify all equipment.   They will perform these audits after hours so as not to interrupt any daily activities. 

Additionally, with the Churn Freeze already in place, it is important to note that once the audits are performed this week, the information gathered is what will be used to plan for the migration of your IT equipment to ECS.  If changes are made to ANY of the workstations (increase in monitors; CPU upgrades, laptop change, etc.), these will not be captured, and we cannot guarantee these changes will be in place with your move to ECS.  


Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

"Headcount for Operations - Need Questions Answered","John:
 
I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.
 
We  need some questions answered first to go through this:
 
1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.
 
2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  
 
3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?
 
4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?
 
5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?
 
We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

""We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. We have entered a busy season here in
Washington. Soon, Congress will be back in session. I will go to the
Capitol to report on the state of our union and I will present a budget
that sets the priorities of our government for fiscal year 2003.

Our highest priorities are clear to all. We must give our military every
tool and weapon it needs to prevail in the war against terror. We must
strengthen our country's defenses against further attack, with a
comprehensive program of homeland security. And we must get our
country's economy growing and creating jobs once again.

Preserving Freedom, Beating Terror
By Alan Keyes

As we settle in for the long haul in the war against terrorism, we are
establishing the patterns that will determine whether that war secures
or loses our liberty.  Much depends on the kind of contribution average
American citizens make to this effort.  How can we help protect American
liberty, and strengthen it in the process?  Some history will help
answer this question.

After the Second World War, the governing concept of American military
policy shifted from mobilization to readiness, on the assumption that we
had to be ready for conflict, on a relatively large scale, at all times.
 The shift was reasonable, made necessary by the persistent military
challenge from the Soviet Union and the need to protect friends and
interests around the globe.

Lurking Threat Of National ID Card: Can Big Brother Be Stopped?
By Carol Devine-Molin

Unfortunately, it appears that we are inexorably moving toward a
National Identification Card system, an Orwellian nightmare that would
permit easy tracking and surveillance of individuals on a level once
considered unimaginable. It's not happening in a blatant power grab by
government, but in small, incremental steps that nonetheless will have
the same deleterious outcome. Our society is ""slipping and sliding""
toward ""Big Brother"" snoopery with plans for embedding crucial
identification data into microchips on our drivers' licenses. And,
clearly, widespread encroachment upon our privacy is being significantly
abetted by advancing technologies. Understandably, civil libertarians
are sounding the clarion call to alert the general public to the
inherent dangers of a centralized identification system.

Have Gun, Will Travel
By SARTRE

Few topics cause more confusion and emotionalism than the subject of
guns. But before you speculate that this pacifist author is against the
second amendment, consider the nature of the real issue. Guns are simply
an instrument of function. The principle that is part of our heritage,
is the inalienable ability for self defense. This natural right, does
not exist because government has passed a law or grants some privilege.
Protecting your own life and safety is intrinsic to your very existence.
So why do so many people confuse gun ownership with self protection,
when the former is only a means, while the later is an immutable right?

Final Attack on America: The Assault on Her Christian Heritage and
Values
By Dorothy Anne Seese

My greatest fear for the beloved America in which I was born is not from
Islamic terrorists, as brutal as they are in their fierce hatred. (The
media's labeling of them as ""fundamentalists"" is quite ironic, because
fundamentalism is adhering to the core of one's belief system, which
would be an indictment of the Islam of the Qur'an as advocating
terrorism.)

America will never be destroyed from without, whether a few planes are
taken down or not. The recent airport fiascos are a testimony to our
hysteria rather than to the common sense alternative of arming the pilot
and first officer with guns, and the flight attendants with stun guns.
While all the airport boondoggles are wasting time and enormous amounts
of money, the Islamic radicals could be out purchasing surface-to-air
missiles to bring down any flight they wish to target, as some believe
TWA Flight 800 was brought down.

The people on the list for VM should be: 

Scotty Gilbert 
Eugene Lee 
Donna Sheidun 
Heather Dunton 



Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.  Stacey will let me know by Sunday where Heather sits relative to Risk.

Thanks for the reminder.  Just an FYI - it is not babysitting when it is your own kids.  (Just kidding - wanting to share a pet peeve of my sister's.)

I am not sure if I said or not that I would be out Tues. Jess has a series of doctor appointments (due to family history) tomorrow so I will be babysitting. Don't think I will be missing anything with it being so slow.

"RE: Food for thought","I believe so.  Basically, the true-up flag will need to be set from previous day through current day and the current day (e.g. 1/31 for the 1/31 vs. 1/30 calc) will need to be true-up.  Currently, even if we set the true-up parameters to true-up through the current day, port calc still will not true it up.  However, with the high volume of financial transactions the traders will be doing, we will have to find a way to true up the last day before we close the books for the month.

wonderful point!!!  

Norman, looks like your next task has just arrived!!!  Let me know if you have questions regarding this, but we do need to be able to true up through the current day of calc when necessary.

Subject:	Food for thought

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. On Monday, communities across America will
celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Laura will
visit Atlanta to commemorate the day in Dr. King's home town. I will
welcome Dr. King's family to the White House. This year's observance is
an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of Dr. King, and honor the
principles for which he lived and died.

Americans can proudly say that we have overcome the institutionalized
bigotry that Dr. King fought. Now our challenge is to make sure that
every child has a fair chance to succeed in life. That is why education
is the great civil rights issue of our time.

Liberty's Silver Lining
By Alan Keyes

Friends of liberty began this new year in sorrow over the sudden death
of Tom Silver, president and cofounder of the Claremont Institute and
champion of the principles and practice of liberty.  He died suddenly of
an aggressive brain tumor that was only discovered days earlier, but
what we will remember is a life devoted to the service of God, liberty,
country, family and friends.  Men like Tom Silver make liberty possible,
and the privilege of having them as fellow citizens is a great part of
what makes liberty so sweet.

Beyond News Media Bias
By Carol Devine-Molin

""When it comes to arrogance, power, and lack of accountability,
journalists are probably the only people on the planet who make lawyers
look good."" Steven Brill - editor of the now defunct media watchdog
publication ""Brill's Content"".

This aforesaid quote is the opening salvo launched by journalist Bernard
Goldberg in his recently published book, ""Bias"", a provocative tome that
is garnering an array of responses, both in and out of the field of
 journalism. The veteran newsman, and consummate insider, produced a
notable expose that examines entrenched liberal bias in the newsroom,
and the accompanying distortions in the news. What motivated Goldberg to
write a book that was sure to cause much angst in the news business?
 Actually, he has been on this trajectory for several years, sounding
the alarm on numerous occasions, both privately and in the press,
regarding the scourge of the left-leaning news media.

Statue Squabble Embodies Lies of Racial Preferences
By Marc Levin

After captivating America and the world with its courage and heroism in
putting out the monstrous fire of September 11, the New York City Fire
Department was recently forced to extinguish the flames of a public
relations disaster. Developer Bruce Ratner commissioned a statue for the
FDNY headquarters based on the inspirational photo of firemen Billy
Eisengrein, George Johnson and Dan McWilliams hoisting the American flag
at Ground Zero the afternoon of September 11.

However, there was one modification to Hackensack Record photographer
Thomas E. Franklin's image: the three white firemen morphed into one
white, one black and one Hispanic. Thus, the two white firefighters were
replaced by fictitious firemen of color who did not actually rise from
the rubble and unfurl Old Glory.

Dear Mr. President, There are Still Right-Wing Republicans Out Here
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Perhaps somehow, somewhere, someone in your administration may read
this, President Bush, and let you know that all the conservatives
haven't come to terms with either the globalist agenda or the centrist
policies in this nation.

There are many of us out here in the land of cyberspace who communicate
with each other about the America we feel we are losing.  We are still
Republicans, but we feel our party is leaving us without a voice, other
than that of Ron Paul, in Congress.  Maybe it's time to just organize
our complaints one by one.

Capitalist Owners of the Corporate Economy
By SARTRE

As any school student knows, Capitalism is supposed to be based upon
ownership of a business venture. Whether private or corporate, this
proprietary claim is founded on the principle of property.  To deny the
legitimacy of this right, is to forego the sovereignty of the
individual. For People to be Free, they must retain the right of
ownership, especially as applied to a business. But owning a company
does not guarantee that its control is under your command.

"haruspex: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Looking for a new kind of feeding frenzy? Feast on colorful
references in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Allusions.
http://www.m-w.com/book/writref/allusion.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 12 is:

haruspex   \huh-RUSS-peks\   (noun)
     : a diviner in ancient Rome basing his predictions on
inspection of the entrails of sacrificial animals

Example sentence:
     The haruspex declared that the outcome of the battle would
be favorable.

Did you know?
     ""Haruspex"" was formed in Latin by the combination of
""haru-"" (which is akin to ""chorde,"" the Latin word for ""gut"")
and ""-spex"" (from the verb ""specere,"" meaning ""to look"").
Appropriately, ""haruspex"" can be roughly defined as ""one who
looks at guts."" The ancient Romans had a number of ways of
determining whether the gods approved of a particular course of
action. Such divination was called ""augury,"" and a haruspex was
a type of ""augur,"" an official diviner of ancient Rome. (Other
augurs divined the will of the gods through slightly less
gruesome means, such as observing the behavior of birds or
tracking celestial phenomena.) ""Haruspex,"" like ""augur,"" has
developed a general sense of ""one who prophesies,"" but this
use is somewhat rare.

TXU would like to close out all of their positions, and have finally provided us with their view of MTM and other charges for physical and financial power and gas for EPMI, ENA, EES and Enron Canada.  Would each of you please provide me with corresponding Enron numbers for your respective areas.  Michelle, as you will see, there is an item under ENA titled ""other"" - is this something from your area?  Elizabeth - given the net amount they owe us ($114,751,812.) if we can agree on numbers, can we take this as a one off item to the bankruptcy judge?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Carl,

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

thanks

JDS

"circadian: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Do you have the skills you need to get a good job?
If you want to secure your future, you need training.
http://links.quinstreet.com/adclick?area=fensuihagunduo
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for October 17 is:

circadian   \ser-KAY-dee-un\   (adjective)
      : being, having, characterized by, or occurring in
approximately 24-hour periods or cycles (as of biological
activity or function)

Example sentence:
     ""Set regular times for going to bed and waking up to
promote predictable circadian rhythms."" (_Washingtonian_,
June 2001)

Did you know?
     Fifty years ago, no one talked about ""circadian rhythms"" --
because ""circadian"" hadn't even been coined yet. In 1959, a
scientist formed the word from the Latin words ""circa"" (""about"")
and ""dies"" (""day""), and it became popular pretty quickly.
""Circadian"" appeared in periodicals throughout the sixties, and
appeared in a Merriam-Webster dictionary before the decade was
up. Most often, it's seen and heard in the term ""circadian
rhythm,"" which refers to the inherent cycle of about 24 hours
that appears to control various biological processes, such as
sleep, wakefulness, and digestive activity. If you want to
impress your friends, you can also use the term ""circadian
dysrhythmia,"" a fancy synonym of ""jet lag.""

"index option","Hi Stacey:

  Just want to follow up to see if there is any after thought about what we discussed yesterday on Index Option.  From our discussion, index option will be reported in two records:  reported as physical in the delivery region, and financial in the index region with the corresponding position and risks.    This seems to be a better alternative than reporting the collapsed position in the delivery region in one record or reporting both position as physical  in two records in the delivery and index region.  

   Could you please let me know if we should go ahead  implementing the changes?  We plan to move the current stage to production tonight and do a new stage release this week, I'd like this change, if going to occur, to go into this release.

   Thanks a lot.

Subject:	Marking Curves For Tuesday 2/5/2002.
Importance:	High

Dear All,

	After the Windows Accounts migration tonight, our UBS traders will not be able to access the Estate EnPower Curve Manager. We are going to copy all the existing Curve data and files from the Estate to the UBS servers tonight. This would be the Final copy, so the UBS Curve data is considered Production data.

	Starting tomorrow, please let the Estate Traders mark the Estate Curves, and UBS traders mark the UBS Production curves.

	Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 and 10:00AM 2/5/2002.

	UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002.

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,


Norman.

PS. Kathy, please contact Min if you need help on Alberta's Excel Position Managers ( Curve) files.

Subject:	RE: New Curves - REVISED AGAIN

Hi Frank.

Rakesh and I talked with Narshima Mistra, ancillary trader at EES.  The ancillary curve exists almost every power curve and it's more related to the capacity availability rather than market prices. Obviously it's indirectly related to prices since cost of generation, which is one important factor of constraints in the capacity of generation.  So EES has a table of ancillary service price % to generation cost.(Below)  I think this table can be used to simulate the ancillary prices by mapping to regional curves after the modification based on the market prices.  The problem is the illiquidity of this market. The price is reported once in a month as average point, so the RAC should identify the risk in this market, e.g. is it reasonable to get the daily value at risk.  Once again, as long as the daily prices of the ancillary is given, the implementation will be available by doing analysis on the data and making table like below to use in mapping curves.

Frank,
the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently.
Using jumps would be appropriate for them. 

Jaesoo plans to talk to the trader and come up with more concrete suggestions.

How urgent is it to start calculating VAR on them?

Subject:	New Pub Codes for Enpower

Good Morning Stacey,

Jeff Richter wants to start trading ancillary service deals through EOL.  To help facilitate this new business, we need to setup several new pub codes that represent the indexes the California ISO publishes for ancillary services.  A few of the ancillary pub codes are already setup we just need to add the ones for spin & non-spin.  Do you know who we need to get with to have these new pub codes setup?  I will work with the IT guys to ensure the programs that scrape the ISO site and store the prices are updated to capture these new indexes.

Thanks,  David Poston

ps - Please give me a call if you have any questions, 57834


These pub codes already exist:

ISOGRRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLRRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26


These pub codes need to be created:

ISOGSRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLSRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

ISOGNRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)

The voicemail I left was regarding ancillary curves requested by John.  Burton may have emailed you on the request earlier.  I'm following up b/c he's out.

Question - Do we have a rule regarding whether or not we calculated VaR and capture positions for ancillary business?  Based on discussions with Casey Evans we don't report ancillary activity for her regions (var or positions).  In order to keep consistency across the business, it seems that we would either report all ancillary or none.  

Please advise.

Enron's Political Contributions: Another Bad Investment
By Marc Levin

Recent revelations about Enron's extensive political contributions have
been portrayed as impugning the integrity of the Bush administration and
bolstering the case for campaign finance reform. However, upon closer
scrutiny, it is apparent that Enron's bevy of political contributions
provided the company little political power when it most needed it.

Thus, far from proving the need for campaign finance reform, the Enron
debacle illustrates that political contributions may be one of the worst
investments a business can make. The real lesson from this fiasco may be
that company shareholder representatives and boards of directors should
be more skeptical of the utility of corporate political expenditures.

Democrats on a Partisan Fishing Trip
By Linda Chavez

Sometimes you're damned if you do and damned if you don't --  especially
if there's partisan advantage in it. That seems to be the case with the
recent controversy involving the Enron Corporation and the Bush
administration. It seems Enron executives, hoping for some help, called
folks in the Bush administration last fall when signs of the company's
financial crisis were becoming clearer to insiders. The Bush appointees
listened, checked with their lawyers and did nothing --  which is
exactly what they should have done. Now some Democrats want to turn the
administration's inaction into a federal case.

What Keeps Rumsfeld up at Night?
By Austin Bay

Does a year make a difference?

When the issue is the efficiency, competence and foresight of U.S.

calendric event.

Of course, Sept. 11, 2001, is the critical mark on that time line. Its
tragic spike moved ""the intelligence issue"" from the theoretical and
obscure to the immediate and focused.

Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again
By Heather Wayman

Well, it's official! Congress has succeeded in telling the military
retirees of this country that their 20+ years of service in defense of
this nation don't mean diddly squat. They have told veterans in no
uncertain terms that it doesn't matter that they gave the best years of
their working lives to defend the freedoms of those in Congress, the
White House and even the folks down on Main Street, Anytown, USA.
Congress had the power to right a wrong directed at only one group of
persons in this country, the military retiree. They failed miserably and
delivered only lip service.

'Black Hawk Down' Brilliantly Depicts The Peril of Entrusting Our
Military to Liberal Statesmen
By Rick Erickson

Do not miss Director Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down.  Like the tribute
in classic Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down is a motion picture
memorial.  Lest we forget, Black Hawk Down reminds us of our
servicepeople's willingness to enter the fray, regardless of the
political, tactical and numerical odds like the ones our soldiers faced
in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3, 1993.

The movie, based upon Mark Bowden's Nobel worthy chronicle, honors the
dead and wounded soldiers played by actors who rehearsed their military
roles at Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg, North Carolina - the
proving grounds for most of the soldiers who fought and died at the
Battle of Mogadishu.  The movie achieves realism by simulating the fear,
rage and exhilaration experienced by the soldiers themselves.

The Tax Fight: It's Fun Having the White House
By Fred Wszolek

These last few days have been a truly fun time to be a Republican.

Poor Tom Daschle popped off on how he thought the Bush tax cuts were a
mistake, and soon the White House dropped a political ""Daisy Cutter"" on
him. Daschle was forced to come out and explain how he really wasn't
advocating a tax increase, as a dozen Democratic Senators took turns
running away from their own leader.

Go back a couple of years, substitute Newt Gingrich, and it's an odd
kind of deja vu.

She is competely on track here. America will not be destroyed from

fear from those whom Ronald Reagan (correctly) characterized as ""the

who trash America's past leaders and heritage; those who demand that
clearly failed and destructive cultures be used as role models; people
who see no difference between Al Quaeda and the men who led the America

or dishonest by their peers, and several other people right inside this

Subject:	New Factor Loadings Have Been Run

All -

New factor loadings were run today (effective date 16-October-2001).

Attached is the VaR file which demonstrates the effect on VaR utilizing 16-October positions/prices/vols.

You may check the before and after factor loadings using the web link (test website) at:	http://rac.dev.corp.enron.com/rmc/MarketRiskApps.asp
Factor loading definition IDs are 2068 for the current factor and 2108 for the new one.

You may check correlations using RisktRAC's Data Grabber.
Correlation definition IDs are 1780 for the current factor and 1800 for the new one.

Implementation:	David has expressed his desire that analysis and the decision whether to implement factor loadings be completed within 24 hours; in other words by end of day Thursday.  If a decision is made not to implement, analysis should be provided indicating the reason (rather than ""need more time"").

Contact:		Frank Hayden in Houston at x58341 (or E-Mail him) as I will be out of the office tomorrow and Friday

Can you please make sure that you are bringing the numbers in as US$ into Credit.

Stacey,
I tested the Adhoc and the portcalc MTM reports to make sure the conversion was happening correctly and it is.  The only odd thing I noticed is that in portcalc in the lower left part of the screen where is shows the MTM, the MTM is in C$; not US$, despite the calc being in US$.

Actually, it would be me.  Mike Mott, our Controller, has not started

take her call as well.

Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening
previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss,
who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave
Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a
management position, her resume should speak for itself.

Let me know.

Do you still have a list of users who calculated their books at the end of September as 9/28 instead of 9/30?

It is just that the short names are EPMI-EAST-PERF  and EPMIWESPER ( not  EPMI-WEST-PERF )

All,

The following have been setup in GCP:

CP# 166985 EPMI West Performance

PLEASE NOTE:
I have confirmed with Casey that  ALL traders (active or inactive in GCP) must be attached to these books.  I am currently working with GCP IT to attach about 350 traders from the back end and will advise when this step is completed.

The request to have all currently performing deals moved to the East Performance and West Performance books has just been expressed as URGENT.  

As soon as the East Performance and West Performance books are set up in Global, we will need Enpower refreshed ASAP.  

Bill H. is coordinating the setup in global, Dave/Crooks are coordinating the script to be run to change the primary desk name.

no, that can't be right, hence ""clear as mud"".  we can have an ""open"" position overall with a counterparty or overall with a region, but there is no such thing as an ""open"" transaction?!

define it as open positions.  if you have a long and a short offsetting with a counterparty, then there is not an open transaction.

My name has been included in the gas lab at 3:15pm for DPR.  I am not involved in any of the gas processes, so do not think that I need to attend that session.  As far as Power DPR, after speaking to my Director Stacey White, I do not think that we need to test DPR for the Estate as we will most likely no longer be using that application.  When we test the NETCO world, we will definitely test DPR.  Let me know if you have any questions.

For those individuals, who have been identified to participate in the test and are unable to attend at your scheduled time, please send me the name of your substitute as soon as possible. The current schedule allows plenty of time for each step. If the test is ahead of schedule, we may call you in at an earlier time.

The Non-Hollywood Version of Special Operations Forces
By Austin Bay

The inquiring TV talking head wanted me to walk him through a Special
Forces operation. Well, not just any operation. He didn't use the terms
""snatch"" or ""arrest,"" but that's the commando action he clearly had in
mind.

As for the target of this Army Green Beret or Navy SEAL bravado? ""Bin
Laden. My producer wants to know if Special Forces can get him?""

No, the Hollywood script didn't follow, not immediately.

Resolve
A Poem by Bram Floria

On bedrock of the Eastern Shore
Stood gates of our prosperity
Ambition's arms uplifted - One
Outstretched to catch a rising sun
The Apple of our Eye

A lance of flaming fury thrown
A fit of ancient jealousy
To all the Earth thunder resounds
An Eagle's wings were brought to ground
We watched the silent skies

The TV News Addiction
By Linda Chavez

The fine line between being cautious and becoming totally paranoid has
all but disappeared for many Americans. How can we go about our daily
lives, as the president rightly instructs us, when every hour seems to
bring new stories of yet another possible exposure to anthrax or a
government warning that further attacks on the United States or American
interests abroad may be imminent? Worst of all, with 24-hour cable
television, it is possible to spend virtually all our waking hours being
bombarded with ""breaking news,"" much of which later turns out not to be
true, or at least not quite what it seemed at first.

Is watching this stuff hour after hour any different than watching game
shows or soap operas all day long? Sure, we like to tell ourselves it's
more important, more intellectually stimulating, but that's not why we
watch it. Watching non-stop news becomes a hard-to-break habit, or
worse, a neurotic obsession.

Giving War A Chance
By Mike Bayham

The recent outbreaks of anthrax in Florida and New York has heightened
concerns to a new level about American security since the attacks on
September 11th.  Some people see the anthrax attacks as a sign that we
should be wary in engaging the terrorists and the nations that harbor
them.  Peaceniks who protested America's strikes against Taliban targets
have been preaching that nothing good will come out of bombing
Afghanistan.

The President and other departments of the Federal government have
already warned the nation that new attacks against American interests
overseas are likely and that there is the strong possibility that
American blood could be spilled again at home by those who were
connected to the World Trade Center and Pentagon attack.

A Mission Fraught With Peril
By Scott Gillette

The recent and overwhelming chain of events that have changed the world
forever began in the hearts of terrorists, and then moved to flight
schools and nondescript motels in Florida. They climaxed in the wanton
destruction of a major component of the financial capital of the world.
Now this odyssey with an uncertain ending moves to one of the most
forbidding places on the planet.

The contrast between New York City and Afghanistan could not be starker.
Downtown New York was and still is a brash, cosmopolitan celebration of
humankind's achievements and our ability to be our masters of our own
destiny, an Enlightenment idea if there ever was one. Moreover, the
World Trade Center Towers represented the symbol and substance of
commerce and world markets, and the idea that Joseph Schumpeter's
creative destruction will provide a better life for future generations.

www.idespiseamerica.commie
By Bonnie Chernin Rogoff

A madman who thinks he's God creates a monster out of human body parts.
Isn't that what Frankenstein was all about?

This war on terror is beginning to look like a twisted version of the
gothic novel. The evil Doctor Frankenstein attempted to redefine the
creation of life, as we know it. He was trying to create life from
death; a reverse abortion.

In the aftermath of tragic death and destruction, war creates life too.
War protects freedom and allows life to proceed with advantage, but only
if the strategy is allowed to proceed without too much interference. The
peaceniks are trying to intercept our course of action, and can destroy
the three principles of war necessary to sustain the human right to
life.

Republican Study Committee Update

The following are some of the legislative activities of conservatives in
the House:

--Rep. John Shadegg (R-AZ) introduced legislation aimed at bolstering
the travel and tourism industry. The ""Travel America Now"" Act (H.R.
3041) would provide a $500 tax credit per person ($1,000 for a couple
filing jointly) for personal travel expenses for travel within the U.S.

--Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) introduced a resolution calling for school
children to pray in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

Outside View: Responsibility and Power
By Craig Shirley
Special to United Press International

The ancient Greek admonishment goes, ""never give a child a sword.""
Beyond the obvious, the phrase also meant that one should never grant
power to someone too immature to handle it.

Irresponsible behavior has become the norm rather than the exception in
our culture because it's so easy now to apologize for infractions or
sins or omissions and be forgiven. A quick jet trip to the Betty Ford
Center to be ""rehabbed"" in 12 easy steps and then celebrated and
applauded for being weak or ""just human."" That is, until they trip
themselves up again. Then we are forced to witness the whole sorry
spectacle once more.

*** Re: The Sick Mind of Noam Chomsky: Part II Method and Madness (David
Horowitz)

I wish everyone in America would read this article. Afterwards they
would surely condemn MIT for providing a salary to such an obtuse
anti-American as Noam Chomsky.  If the American people are lucky, Noam
Chomsky will go live in one of the Communist countries he so adores,
then we will never hear from him again.
-- Richard Littiken

Bravo Horowitz! Noam Chomsky has been a left wing ""know it all"" for many
years.  As a young student many years ago, I remember reading his silly
socialist leanings and hearing the professors rave about Chomsky's
analysis.  What is clear is that the world has once again tried to paint
the USA as the evil doers and the international business community as
some kind of demon hell bent on beating up ""little people"".  Horowitz
nails the issues and brightens the day for reasonable truth about U.S.
foreign policy and, most importantly, the context for the policies
during the last century.  As we all know, context drives foreign policy.
-- M. Gene Aldridge, New Mexico

Good writing by David. As my favorite journalist says of the peaceniks
-- ""Get a Life."" David may be helping in keeping the them at bay while
our President gets on with the protection of the Freedom of the world
-- John F. Manning


*** Re: Alan Keyes Columns

Mr. Keyes article is to the point and very motivational as always. I
always have the feeling I'm getting ready to go on the field for the
championship game. He is such a patriot. It's too bad President
Bush can't find some place fore him. He would be an asset.
-- Wayne Kellar, Versailles, Kentucky

We need more writers like Alan Keyes. He is truly an American, an
example for all to follow.

All, 
I received a call from Sally Beck today alerting me to concerns about spreading the risk group across the floor (gas team - power team).  From a control perspective she prefers that the team be all together.  

Can you factor this in and give Sally and me your thoughts as well?  Perhaps we could find an area that is more central to both groups that will help with this (as we've done with fundies).  

Scott and I are meeting Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 - Lloyd and Sally are you free to join us to keep us all on the same page?  Please let me know so I can reserve a room.

"RE: information for the creditors committee","1. My understanding from Barry yesterday is that we do want printouts of each of the rolls that support the DPR.

3. Active Counterparties and Open Transactions.  As discussed yesterday, an open transaction is being defined as ""how many deals on the book at 11/30.""

Thanks, 
Chris

Subject:	RE: information for the creditors committee

Shona - 

A few points/questions on the request:

1.  How detailed do you want the ""rolls supporting DPR information"".....I ask because we have about 40 individual rolls which constitute our DPR info.  Do they just want a print-out from Excel of each of these rolls?!

2.  All PRMA info needs to come from Accounting (Tracy Greene)

3.  What are they classifying as an ""open"" transaction?!  If you let me know how they are differentiating between an ""open"" and an ""active"" transaction, I can possibly have our IT guys run a script to get a number in an efficient manner.

4.  We can get you the number of books and commercial support people

5.  Average number of transactions per day can possibly be obtained from someone in the EOL group (and then simply extrapolated to obtain a number representing our complete population of deals) as EOL constitutes approximately 75% of the power trading activity

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
Casey

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

"Dec and Jan liquidations","It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Importance:	High

The Power desks were set up with the identifier as NETCO as part of the name to keep them separate from the old book names. The set up was done originally in the Estate Environ. before the systems were split.  The name can be changed to lose the NETCO ref. if need be.  Hope this clarifies the many email attachments below!

These NETCO references should not have been part of the test.  
After today, the upstream source needs to remove (or rename) to their real name.  NetCo named testing was for last week only.

Wednesday and Thursday testing should not use these desks.

Andrea,
I'm hearing from David Poston that EOL deals were sent down with old desks (?) that kicked out of EnPower.

David,
Attached is what EOL sent, please verify these loaded.
What data did EOL send down incorrectly?  We need to fix for the Wednesday and Thursday test.

 << File: trans summary 020402 POWER.xls >> 

I'm also hearing from Lori that the deals were not scheduled?  Who does this, and I assume we need to reschedule for the new data?

Andrea,
Can you verify the spreadsheet of the deals you processed for Power, and send your updates back?

 << File: 0204 Global Data Setup AND transactions.xls >> 


Thanks.  The goal is to have these settled in Unify for SAP transmission at 1pm.

Regan-

I'm still having a problem seeing those deals in Deal Entry.  If I run a search, it tells me that there are 'no records selected', which is very strange as I know there are at least 20 deals in there that have been entered by either myself or the EOL testers.  Any ideas?

"gauntlet: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Find him and other
winners in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American Writers.
http://www.m-w.com/book/peoplace/amwrit.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for January 17 is:

gauntlet   \GAWNT-lut or GAHNT-lut\   (noun)
     1 : a protective glove
    *2 : an open challenge (as to combat)
     3 : a dress glove extending above the wrist

Example sentence:
    Herb threw down the gauntlet, asking his guests, ""Which one
of you wants to get beaten in a game of chess?""

Did you know?
     ""Gauntlet"" comes from the Middle French ""gantelet,"" the
diminutive of ""gant,"" meaning ""glove."" (The ""gauntlet"" meaning
""ordeal"" or ""double file of armed men"" is a different word of
a different origin.) Ultimately, ""gant"" is of Germanic origin.
To ""throw down the gauntlet"" means ""to issue an open challenge.""
To ""pick up the gauntlet"" means ""to accept an open challenge.""
These figurative phrases come from the conventions of medieval
combat. The gauntlet was the glove of a suit of armor. To
challenge someone to combat, a knight would throw his glove at
another knight's feet. The second knight would take it up if he
intended to accept the challenge, in which case a jousting match
might ensue.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. ""as normal"" - the remainder will be ""frozen"" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

"FW: Brazilian Curve","Stacey,

I think the idea of having two books stinks.  We would have to touch every deal every month to move the ""prompt"" long term month into the short term book.  (Ok - we only have five long term deals right now but ...)  Maybe I'm over reacting.  Do you know of any other instances where this is done to account for risks?

I think a better idea would be to continue with one book using one curve - Pushkar's front end and our curve 3+ years.  We keep the Rho & Drift from this book.
The SA traders could then execute trades with Pushkar to hedge our short term exposure.  They could tell us the P/L to report and in theory this would be the offset to
the short term Rho in the power book.

RNC Shakeup: Swapping a General for a Colonel
By Mike Bayham

This past weekend the ""leadership"" of the national Republican Party
converged on Austin, Texas to ratify the second RNC head in as many
years.  The vote to elect former Montana Governor Marc Racicot was a
mere formality with President George W. Bush's post-election/debacle
decree that Racicot should be running the RNC going into the mid-term
Congressional races.

It is tradition, and good policy, that the occupant of the White House,
or his advisers, select the chairman of the national party so that the
strategies and messages coming out of both camps are coordinated.
 Because the now immediate past RNC Chairman did not fully understand
this tradition and reality, he is now out of a job.

New Government Report Raises Concerns in Light of Terrorist Threat
GOPUSA News Wire

In a newly released report, the Census Bureau estimated that perhaps
115,000 people from Middle Eastern countries live in the United States
illegally. The estimates are based on the Bureau's preliminary analysis
of the 2000 census. The findings are especially troubling given the role
failures in immigration control played in September 's terrorist
attacks. Not only were at least three of the September 11th hijackers
illegal aliens, a number of past terrorists have also been illegal
aliens from the Middle East, including Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, who tried
to bomb the New York subway system in 1997, and Mohammed Salameh, who
took part in the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.

Fighting Terror in the Philippines will be Different
By Austin Bay

Defeating Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan has given the United
States tremendous political momentum, which bodes well for upcoming
military and diplomatic operations in The War on Terror.

However, an American public now familiar with ""the Afghan example"" of
warfare should not expect that model to apply too rigorously in the
Philippines.

Don't Believe Everything You Read
By Linda Chavez

The coincidence was almost too good to be true. ""An old news video of
Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
Reagan Administration,"" the e-mail from a friend began, ""what he said
was stunning!"" I remember the event well.

I worked with Ollie North in the Reagan White House from 1985 until
early in 1986, when I was director of public liaison. He was a
charismatic speaker, one I frequently enlisted for briefings on the
situation in Nicaragua, where the United States was trying to help a
group of guerrillas known as the Contras, who were trying to overthrow
the communist Sandinista government there. When Congress cut off funds
to the Contras, Ollie helped set up a clandestine operation to raise
private money for the group. In November 1986, the operation was
discovered, leading to the worst crisis of the Reagan administration and
to criminal indictments against North (whose conviction was later
overturned) and others involved. The Congress also held hearings in
which North and others testified.

It is the 29th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.  Usually an anniversary
symbolizes a happy occasion, such as a wedding or a graduation or the
birth of a son or a daughter.

It is only since 1973, on that ominous day 29 years ago, that America
celebrates the deaths of her sons and daughters.  Nearly 50 million sons
and daughters to be precise.

*** Re: Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again (Heather Wayman)

You have done something most of the press absolutely refuses to do...

thank you for the fairness you have shown.

HIP HIP HOORAY! To Heather Wayman! You said it and wrote it correctly.
I'm still baffled by Congress. I wish they would've gotten out there and
spent at least 20 years of military service. But they didn't! Why?
'Cause it's tough duty! I just don't understand them, but I do
understand their pay raises which should be going to disabled veterans!
-- Alma R. Farrar, SFC(Ret.) U.S. Army

Sir, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Heather Wayman and
GOPUSA for the article outlining the injustices pertaining to military
retirees and concurrent receipt of VA disability compensation.  SHe did
a wonderful job, and clearly outlined the injustice to all disabled
military retirees. I am a retiree of the U.S. Navy (20 years), and a
disabled Vietnam Veteran. I have been paying for my own VA compensation
for almost 30 years!! I should have been a Congressman!! Thanks again,
Heather!

*** Re: 'Black Hawk Down' Brilliantly Depicts The Peril of Entrusting
Our Military to Liberal Statesmen (Rick Erickson)

The events of Mogadishu, as depicted in Black Hawk Down, brings
compelling clarity to the reality that when our sons, our daughters and
our fathers who serve in the US military are commanded to put their
lives on the line; that they are allowed to quickly and decisively
effect defeat of their opponent without the restrictions imposed by
political considerations. The US military forces are an awesome power
that should only be unleashed when we mean business, never as bluffing
tool. Hoo-ah!
-- Steve Findley, TX

Thanks to Rick Erickson for telling the truth. As a former US Navy
member serving during that time and wanting to be there, most of my
shipmates were outraged at what Clinton and Aspen did. I would hope that
this information would hit the mainstream press, but I am not holding my
breath. I wonder what the public would say if they knew the real facts
about what really happened. I will go and see this movie and know that I
will shed a tear for my brothers. Thanks again Mr. Erickson, shipmate.

Subject:	NETCO access to RisktRAC

Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.  In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).  With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.  I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.  Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).  As such, I recommend the following: 

In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.

How does that sound?

Thanks

Hey guys, 

We need to try and get this populated today and distributed.  Can each of you please take a look at the assigned section and let me know your comments.  The only thing we are trying to do here is identify the activities of the Estate and what needs to be performed by the resources in each group.

Cara & Mike will you please update the scheduling and trading areas? 

Stacey, will you please update the risk area?

I will work on the settlements / volume Management and I will work with Dave Steiner on the IT section.

Thanks so much for everyone's help.  I'm sorry I'm out of the office today.  We really need to get this done ASAP to help management understand who is available to assist in this time of transition.

Thanks - MO

Tom,

After our call today Mike Purcell and I spent a little time talking.  We also have some time schedule to Cara and Jeff Richter tomorrow  I have put together the attached  template which I will hopefully have filled out for you by tomorrow afternoon.

Our biggest concern today was how we would address the Real-Time scheduling requirements.  Mark Guzman is part of the estate and should be able to cover the day shift during the week and we can outsource to UBS to cover all the other shifts (Just a proposal).  In addition, Lester Rawson is part of the estate and has Real-Time experience and is also the individual who currently manages the El Paso obligations.

If you have any questions please give me a call @ 503-702-9846.

"Update to Bus Pass Information","
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.

"eccentric: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Enjoy a year's worth of poems, puns, and puzzles in
The Best of an Almanac of Words at Play.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/puzzspec/wordplay.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for February 4 is:

eccentric   \ik-SEN-trik or ek-SEN-trik\   (adjective)
     1 a : not of the usual or normal kind *b : acting or
thinking in an unusual way
     2 : deviating from a circular path; especially
: elliptical

Example sentence:
     ""Joyce is a little eccentric, to say the least,"" said
Melvin, ""but I actually find her quirky personality to be quite
refreshing.""

Did you know?
     ""Eccentric"" comes to us through Middle English from the
Medieval Latin word ""eccentricus,"" but it is ultimately derived
from a combination of the Greek words ""ex,"" meaning ""out of,""
and ""kentron,"" meaning ""center."" The original meaning of
""eccentric"" in English was ""not having the same center"" (as in
""eccentric spheres""). In this sense, it contrasts with
""concentric,"" meaning ""having a common center"" (as in
""concentric circles, one within another""). But since at least
1630, English speakers have also used ""eccentric"" to describe
individuals who are figuratively off-center. It can also be
used to describe something that doesn't follow a truly circular
path, as in ""an eccentric orbit.""

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Thanks,  David Poston

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Subject:	Enpower Outage Notice ***THIS WEEKEND***

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the ""PWRPRODN"" or ""PWRPRODN_DED"" database aliases to ""ESTPWRPN"".

Thanks,  David Poston

It's not as detailed as you may be thinking. 

We run an unofficial adhoc book for the LT-SW and LT-Options book with option sensitivity checked as on
Run the West_Sens_new macro created by Min and Zhiyun after calc has finished
Spreadsheet is sent to Matt for his use
audience is Matt Motley and Mike Driscoll
Matt only looks at the spreadsheet based on current market conditions and does not do any type of stress testing. As a result we always make sure there are no scenarios in the predictive option sensitivity area..

John,

Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley?  If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.

"NETCO","The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Subject:	Interest Rate Curves

Hi,

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

James

There are additional counterparties which need to have their primary counterparty changed on all active deals....just as we've done previously...to East Performance or West Performance.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which lists the secondary counterparty codes for all of these entities, separated according to East or West portfolio.

We would like to be able to run the script tomorrow morning, if possible.

Please call if you have any questions.

"conquian: M-W's Word of the Day","***************************************************************
Enjoy a year's worth of poems, puns, and puzzles in
The Best of an Almanac of Words at Play.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/book/puzzspec/wordplay.htm
***************************************************************

The Word of the Day for February 3 is:

conquian   \KONG-kee-un\   (noun)
     : a card game for two played with 40 cards from which all
games of rummy developed

Example sentence:
     The two friends whiled away a long summer day with endless
games of conquian.

Did you know?
     ""Conquian"" is a very old card game, played more frequently
in the past than it is now. It is based upon the ""draw and
discard"" principle that forms the basis for all modern games of
rummy and is played with 40 cards, setting aside certain cards
of a 52-card deck. (The most common variations involve the
removal of either all face cards, or the tens, nines, and eights.)
The goal of the game is to form three or four of a kind, or
sequences. ""Conquian"" comes to us from Mexican Spanish, but the
word is ultimately derived from the Spanish ""con quien,"" meaning
""with whom?""
