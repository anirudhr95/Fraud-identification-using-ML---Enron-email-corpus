"TBG","Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has executed the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a more detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta 65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to clear up any issues with Trigen.

Frank

"FW:","
Read each sentence slowly and think about it.

Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends
with a tear.

Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.

Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and
impossible to forget.

You can only go as far as you push.

Actions speak louder than words.

The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love,
love somebody else.

Don't let the past hold you back, you're missing the
good stuff.

Life's short. If you don't look around once in a while
you might miss it.

A BEST FRIEND is like a four leaf clover, HARD TO FIND
and LUCKY TO HAVE.

Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in
it.

BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us.

When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look
ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND
will
be there.

TRUE FRIENDSHIP ""NEVER"" ENDS. Friends are FOREVER.

Good friends are like stars....You don't always see
them, but you know they are always there.

Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love
with
your smile.

What do you do when the only person who can make you
stop crying is the person who made you cry?

Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.

Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then
it's not the end.

Most people walk in and out of your life, but only
friends leave footprints in your heart.

Send this on to everyone special in your life, even
the
people who really make you mad sometimes and to the
people whose lives you want to be in!!!

And send it back to the person who sent it too you
if they mean something to you !!

Remember, every minute spent angry is sixty seconds of
happiness wasted.


AWESOME PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust
God
that you are exactly where you are meant to be. ""I
believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to
our
feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to
fly.""

Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on
the
fourth day. Do not break this, please. There is no
cost,
but lots of rewards.

"Hey you...","
Hey Andy,

How are you?  I saw Stephanie a couple of weeks ago in Napa and asked about
you.  Then, I meant to send you a note before now, but better late than
never.  I've been thinking of all of you this week, and hoping that
everything is going ok.  I remember what it is like to have your company the
focus of lots of analyst and media attention, and I hope it turns out fine
you all there.

I don't have any news to tell.  I am doing good, enjoying a beautiful fall
here, but not looking forward to winter.  I may be coming down to the
Nutcracker Market in a couple weeks.  Any chance that you will be there?

Susan

"Hi","Hi Andy,

How are things?  I am still in Houston looking for a
new home.  I hope that all is well with you.
Hopefully some certainty will happen with Newco in the
near future.  I wanted some help from you in finding a
job.  I know that you are very well respected in the
industry so if any opportunity that may fit me comes
your way could you please let me know.  Thank you for
everything.  It was a pleasure working with you at
Enron.  I have attached a copy of my resume to this
email.

Thanks again and hope to hear from you soon,
Dayem

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

"YOU HAVE 48 HOURS - Message from Louise Kitchen","

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

"FW: Sending a smile","I hope the picture comes thru - it's adorable
 

 


  <http://makesmesmile.com/friends/keepsmiling/titleimg.gif>
SMILING is infectious, You catch it like the flu 
When someone SMILED at me today, I started SMILING too 
I passed around the corner and someone saw my grin 
When he SMILED, I realized I'd passed it on to him. 
I thought about that smile, then realized its worth, 
A single SMILE just like mine could travel 'round the earth. 
So if you feel a SMILE begin, don't leave it undetected. 

LET'S START AN EPIDEMIC QUICK AND GET THE WORLD INFECTED! 
  <http://makesmesmile.com/friends/keepsmiling/smilecat.jpg>
KEEP THE SMILE GOING BY SENDING THIS 
ON TO A FRIEND 
Everyone needs a smile !!

"RE: BUG Rebooking","Andy Ring and Sandra Brawner need to be at this meeting.

Subject:	RE: BUG Rebooking

Maureen Smith and Ruth Concannon have raised some issues regarding how Brooklyn Union Gas is in the books, specifically, the final contract year (11/1/03 - 10/31/04) is not in the books at all (which will produce a gain when booked), and the current deal structure is telescoped incorrectly at Transco Zones 1,3, & 4 when it should be telescoped 17% at Zone 1, 25% at Zone 2, and 58% at Zone 3.  This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss.  

The purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & Frank before making any changes to the books.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks!

Kelli

"Re: Note","Dear Andy and Dick, 
I think I just hit the wrong button and sent you an e-mail with nothing on it, if so, sorry. 
We were so glad to hear from you as we have been worried about your job situation. We got an e-mail from Michele saying she still has her job but doesn't know for how long. It's still hard to believe a company can get themselves in such a mess! We would love to have you visit anytime you can get away. (We are a lot closer than Omaha).I hate to think of you being in Houston without any family close by, especially during the holidays. 
The rain finally stopped today so Bob and I went out to finish up our Christmas shopping. Now I just have all the wrapping to do.  Britt said she would come over tomorrow and help get it done. Thank goodness for my granddaughter!         
Love and prayers, Aunt Mary Lou and Uncle Bob

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"FW: trigen","Here is a schedule that I received from Phillip.  

I'm not sure if I'm reading the schedule correctly, but here are some items to think about:

1)	The price to Trigen is a 3 month average of NGW and IF for Z3 and Z4 times a premium.
2)	Because only one month at a time rolls off the books, there will always be an OA variance.
3)	The OA variance due to the 3 month rolling average will eventually flatten out over time.
4)	This OA variance, however, doesn't address the fact that Andy is getting 50% Z3 and 50% Z4 and having to deliver Z4.
5)	For November 2001, there was some gas that was delivered at Z3, but the price was not adjusted for fuel and transport, so if
	you deliver gas at Station 65, you do not get the same price as you would for Station 85.

Hopefully this makes sense.

Parachute

Charles Plumb was a U.S. Navy jet pilot in Vietnam.  After 75 combat
missions, his plane was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile.  Plumb
ejected and parachuted into enemy hands.  He was captured and spent 6 years
in a communist Vietnamese prison.  He survived the ordeal and now lectures
on lessons
learned from that experience.

One day, when Plumb and his wife were sitting in a restaurant, a man at
another table came up and said, ""You're Plumb!  You flew jet fighters in
Vietnam from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk.  You were shot down!""

""How in the world did you know that?"" asked Plumb.

""I packed your parachute,"" the man replied.  Plumb gasped in surprise and
gratitude.

The man pumped his hand and said, ""I guess it worked!""  Plumb assured him,
""It sure did. If your chute hadn't  worked, I wouldn't be here today.""

Plumb couldn't sleep that night, thinking about that man.  Plumb says, ""I
kept wondering what he might have looked like in a Navy uniform: a white
hat, a bib in the back, and bell-bottom trousers.  I wonder how many times I
might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning, how are you?' or
anything because, you see, I was a fighter pilot and he was just a sailor.""

Plumb thought of the many hours the sailor had spent on a long wooden table
in the bowels of the ship, carefully weaving the shrouds and folding the
silks of each chute, holding in his hands each time the fate of someone he
didn't know.

Now, Plumb asks his audience, ""Who's packing your parachute?""  Everyone has
someone who provides what they need to make it through the day.  Plumb also
points out that he needed many kinds of parachutes when his plane was shot
down over enemy territory-he needed his physical parachute, his mental
parachute, his emotional parachute, and his spiritual parachute. He called
on all these supports before reaching safety.

Sometimes in the daily challenges that life gives us, we miss what is really
important.  We may fail to say hello, please, or thank you, congratulate
someone on something wonderful that has happened to them, give a compliment,
or just do something nice for no reason.

As you go through this week, this month, this year, recognize people who
pack your parachute.  I am sending you this as my way of thanking you for
your part in packing my parachute!!!  And I hope you will send it on to
those who have helped pack yours!

Sometimes, we wonder why friends keep forwarding jokes to us without writing
a word, maybe this could explain:

When you are very busy, but still want to keep in touch,
guess what you do   -  you forward jokes.

And to let you know that you are still remembered, you are still important,
you are still loved, you are still cared for, guess what you get? ---  A
forwarded joke.

So my friend, next time if you get a joke, don't think that you've been sent
just another forwarded joke, but that you've been thought of today and your
friend on the other end of your computer wanted to send you a smile.

"Access Card Information","
Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Subject:	Gas Merchantability Reminder

December 19, 2001

Notice to: All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, 
Interconnecting Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental 
Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) System

 Subject: Gas Merchantability Reminder

Transco has been receiving gas with a slightly higher heating 
content (btu/cf) in its mainline over the past week and feels 
this is the result of processing plants scaling back their 
operations due to poor economics. Transco reminds Producers and 
Shippers on its system to ensure that processing arrangements 
are in place and that the gas received by Transco meets its 
merchantability requirements. 

These gas merchantability specifications are outlined in 
Transco's gas merchantability notice, most recently re-posted 
July 27, 2001. 

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact 
the following at Transco: Ron Doyle, 713-215-2921 or Terry 
Fitch, 713-215- 3361.

"FW: Something Worth Seeing","	This is very powerful.  Some photos are very graphic.   

 

I thought this was something that is
worth seeing. I hope none of you are offended. Go to the following link to
see a very powerful tribute to the Tragedy our nation has suffered. It would
probably work best with a high speed line. It is about ten minutes long.

"Final Benefits Memo","

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

"FW: Angels are ...."," 


Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, ""Our God is an Awesome God!"" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared 
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man 
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked 
about how God had led them in different ways. 

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. 
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to 
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest 
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out 
loud, ""God is that you?""  He didn't get a reply and started on toward 
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought 
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how 
little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy 
the milk."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could 
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and 
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn down that 
street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection. 
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next 
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he 
said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will."" 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. 
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a 
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst 
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the 
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed. 

Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the milk to the people in the 
house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark 
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already 
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat. 
""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up, 
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened 
the door.   ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will 
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I 
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they 
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise 
inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?""   Then 
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was 
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out 
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy 
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young 
man thrust out the gallon of milk. ""Here I brought this to you."" 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in 
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward 
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was 
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began 
speaking and half-crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills 
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our 
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some 
milk."" 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with 
some. Are you an Angel?"" 

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he 
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward 
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God 
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten 
people and the person that sent it to you!

"RE: Hey you...","Hey!!  No problem in the delay.  After more carefully reading the
invitation, turns out I am actually going to the market on Wednesday night.
Want to have a drink on Thursday after you finish your shopping?  I think I
may have a dinner date, but not much in the afternoon.  Maybe I'll find so
many things I like that I'll have to go back on Thursday to buy more!
Really, having to travel is a good thing for me at this, it keeps me from
buying much at all.

Hi!

       It is so nice to hear from you!  I am trying not to think of all
that is going on here - but it is not fun.  Seeing you next week,  however,
will be.
Would you have any free time to go to lunch or dinner maybe on Wednesday?

Let me know - sorry for the delay in responding I just opened your note.

   Hey Andy,

   How are you?  I saw Stephanie a couple of weeks ago in Napa and asked
   about
   you.  Then, I meant to send you a note before now, but better late than
   never.  I've been thinking of all of you this week, and hoping that
   everything is going ok.  I remember what it is like to have your company
   the
   focus of lots of analyst and media attention, and I hope it turns out
   fine
   you all there.

   I don't have any news to tell.  I am doing good, enjoying a beautiful
   fall
   here, but not looking forward to winter.  I may be coming down to the
   Nutcracker Market in a couple weeks.  Any chance that you will be there?

   Susan

"Note","Dear Andy, 
Have been reading about the troubles at Enron, hope this hasn't affected your job. 
Are you and Dick going to Omaha for Christmas? Lisa, Billy and Madison will be here on the 23rd and stay for about a week. Steve, Lenora and the boys can't come until the week after Christmas. It's a very busy time of year for Steve, at work.  
Lori, Jeff and their families will be here as usual. 
Did you have a good Thanksgiving? We had a nice quiet day, just Lori, Jeff and their families. Lisa and Billy stayed in Austin this year as it has been a very busy football season for them. 
Jeff and Marsha are back together and seem to be getting along very well. They got a new puppy last week. It's an 11 week old female, yellow Labrador. They named her Gypsy. She is really cute but is going to get pretty big. Oh well, not my problem. 
Hope this finds you and Dick doing well. 
Love, Aunt Mary Lou 
P.S. Uncle Bob sends his love. 
P.P.S. Come see us anytime!!!!

"Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV","Monday February 4, 9:07 am Eastern Time 
Press Release
SOURCE: Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. 
Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV Expansion Of Natural Gas Pipeline System
BOSTON, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. has submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to further expand its natural gas pipeline system. The $250 million expansion project, designated Phase IV, will allow Maritimes to nearly double its capacity to transport natural gas from offshore Nova Scotia to markets in the northeastern United States from approximately 415,000 dekatherms to 800,000 dekatherms per day. 
Demand for natural gas, especially in New England and the Northeast, continues to increase at a rapid rate. Maritimes received substantial requests for transportation services from local natural gas distribution companies, natural gas-fired electric generators and third-party marketers during a recently completed open season nominations period, emphasizing the market's desire for more natural gas from Atlantic Canada. 
``The demand for natural gas is real, and it is significant,'' said Tom O'Connor, president of M&N Management Co., the managing member of Maritimes. ``Maritimes is able to respond to the demand by efficiently and economically expanding its system to deliver new supplies of gas from fields off Canada's east coast. Access to additional sources of this cleaner-burning fuel will ensure greater energy reliability and flexibility for the northeast region.'' 
Earlier this year, Maritimes signed agreements with PanCanadian Energy Services Inc. to transport up to approximately 400 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from PanCanadian's Deep Panuke project, offshore Nova Scotia. The Phase IV expansion project will accommodate the increased volumes of gas. 
The Phase IV expansion complements the planned extension of the Maritimes pipeline from Methuen to Beverly, Mass. The extension -- Phase III of the Maritimes project -- will interconnect the 650-mile Maritimes pipeline with Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.'s 1,000-mile system through Algonquin's proposed HubLine project. The Maritimes Phase III and Algonquin HubLine projects recently received final approval from FERC. 
The Phase IV project proposes to construct four compressor stations in Maine each with approximately 26,800 horsepower of additional compression and approximately 31.3 miles of additional pipeline loop facilities in Maine's Washington County. The new compressor stations are proposed to be located in the municipalities of Eliot, Gorham, Brewer and Searsmont. Maritimes recently held open houses in these communities to provide information on the proposed expansion. 
``We will work closely with federal, state and municipal officials as well as landowners and stakeholders throughout the FERC process to ensure the project is designed and constructed with minimal impact to communities and the environment,'' said Bill Penney, senior vice president and general manager of Maritimes. ``As we proceed with the Phase IV expansion, Maritimes will continue its solid record of environmental, safety and operational compliance.'' 
In addition to the FERC application, Maritimes will submit applications to other appropriate federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Coastal Zone Management and Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The Phase IV expansion is expected to be in service in 2004. 
Maritimes is owned by affiliates of Duke Energy (37.5 percent); Westcoast Energy, Inc. (37.5 percent); ExxonMobil (12.5 percent); and Emera Inc. (12.5 percent). For more information, contact Maritimes on the Internet at www.mnp-usa.com <http://www.mnp-usa.com>.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

  God's Wings
  An  article in National Geographic several years ago provided a penetrating
  picture  of God's wings.  After a forest fire in Yellowstone National Park,
  forest  rangers  began  their  trek  up  a mountain to assess the inferno's
  damage.
  One   ranger   found   a  bird  literally  petrified  in  ashes, perched
  statuesquely  on the ground at the base of a tree. Somewhat sickened by the
  eerie  sight, he knocked over the bird with a stick.  When he gently struck
  it,  three  tiny chicks scurried from under their dead mother's wings. The
  loving  mother,  keenly  aware  of  impending  disaster,  had carried her
  offspring  to  the  base of the tree and had gathered them under her wings,
  instinctively knowing that the toxic smoke would rise. She could have flown
  to  safety  but  had  refused  to  abandon  her babies.  Then the blaze had
  arrived  and  the heat had scorched her small body, the mother had remained
  steadfast.   Because  she had been willing to die, those under the cover of
  her  wings would live.  ""He will cover you with his feathers, and under his
  wings you will find refuge."" (Psalm 91:4)
  Being  loved  this  much should make a difference in your life. Remember
  the  One  who  loves you, and then be different because of it. Please pass
  this  on to others you care about and don't drive faster than your Guardian
  Angel  can  fly.  My instructions were to send this to people that I wanted
  God  to  bless and I picked you.  Please pass this on to people you want to
  be blessed.

Andy, looks like your deliveries at Z4 are settled to you at Z3 and Z4.  That would imply that you have the right to deliver at Z3 and Z4  to match the pricing.  I quess we need to confirm that and determine the correct %'s at each Zone.  Kam and Maureen will follow up on this.

Frank,

Regarding Trigen-Nassau,  Andy sells them the gas at Transco/Z4 but is priced half at Zone 3, half at Zone 4.  This is how the deal was originally booked in TAGG and therefore the desk price must match. 

I would also like to let you know that I will be moving to the West desk, effective tomorrow.  Phillip Love is moving from the Central desk to take my place, and Scott Palmer is moving over to the Central desk.  Obviously, me and Scott will be helping Phillip with VNG.

Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions.


Thanks

Kam

Hey Everybody,

Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine and copy both
sides of each license, credit card, etc. You will know what you had in
your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and
cancel in case it gets lost or worse yet, stolen. Keep the photocopy in
a safe place.

I pass this along, for your information, in case you hadn't thought of
it. We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed us in
your name, address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately (the author of this
piece who happens to be an attorney) had firsthand knowledge, because
my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered
an expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
number from DMV to change my driving record information online, and
more.

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those

where you can find the easily. File a police report immediately in the
jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you
were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there
ever is one).

But here's what is perhaps most important:  (I never ever thought to do
this).  Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never
heard of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was
stolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By

the time I was advised to do this almost 2 weeks after the theft, all
the damage had been done. There are records of all the credit checks
initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before
placing the alert. Since then, no additional damage has been done, and
the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It
seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

Do think about passing this information along. It could really help
someone.

"Are you Okay","Just concerned about you w/ the drop in ENE's stock price.  Are you okay?
Let me know if you need anything.  As much as I miss you guys, I'm sure glad
I left.  If you need anyone to yell to, call me up.  I know we joke around a
lot, but I really mean it.  If you need someone to bitch too, give me a
call.  You were always a good friend to me and hopefully I can repay to
favor.

Well smartypants, we were instructed to get as much done as possible early
on because this new internet virus has caused problems with scheduling
downloads.  I wanted to suspend but Scott would not let me.  Have you
talked to Scott H.?  I feel so bad - the circle of old timers on the east
desk is growing ever tighter.  How are you and your family coping with the
tragedy?  Are you ready to come back to the lone star state yet?  I need to
stop watching the news coverage because I am becoming to fearful of
everything and can't stop crying for the victims and their families.  The
passage of time is not making it easier.  Sorry it took me so long to
respond but I don't check my e-mail as often as I should. Write soon! Take
care!

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.
