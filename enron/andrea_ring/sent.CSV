       It is so nice to hear from you!  I am trying not to think of all that is going on here - but it is not fun.  Seeing you next week,  however, will be.
Would you have any free time to go to lunch or dinner maybe on Wednesday?

Hey Andy,

How are you?  I saw Stephanie a couple of weeks ago in Napa and asked about
you.  Then, I meant to send you a note before now, but better late than
never.  I've been thinking of all of you this week, and hoping that
everything is going ok.  I remember what it is like to have your company the
focus of lots of analyst and media attention, and I hope it turns out fine
you all there.

I don't have any news to tell.  I am doing good, enjoying a beautiful fall
here, but not looking forward to winter.  I may be coming down to the
Nutcracker Market in a couple weeks.  Any chance that you will be there?

Susan

ENA did not attempt to schedule the delivery of gas out of storage after Bridgeline informed me they would not perform on our request because we would have needed to request the customer to submitt a nomination for a delivery that would not be confirmed.

Subject:	TBG

Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has executed the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a more detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta 65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to clear up any issues with Trigen.

Frank

Brad did not accept his offer and is moving to Kansas City to work for Aquila.  Pete quit before he was made an offer to work for a bank in New York City.  I am so happy for him.  All that is left are me, Scott, Judy (working full-time), Chuck, Sandra and Jon McKay.  Scott wants to trade all the points we were trading before so it should be interesting.  He is going to trade the Hub physical and financial.  Judy and I are going to split up everything else. Chuck is going to trade market area.  Frank Vickers, Jared and Craig are all that is left of origination.  Jared had a baby girl on Thursday.  Her name is Kendall Gill (do not know where the Gill came from)  and everyone is doing fine.How are you doing?

I received the following message and immediately contacted the
person that initiated it since I don't like to forward hoaxes. 
Laura lives near L.A. and tells me that to the best of her knowledge 
this is true; however, it could still be a hoax, it's up to you if 
you take it to heart or not. 
 
Peggy 
 
All, My friend Megan here at work called the lady at the end of the
email who confirmed that this is a legit email....she's very skeptical
as well but decided to send it anyway.....SCARY, HUH....Mon 

 
I called and emailed the creator of this message and it is true.
Thanks,
Megan 
 
 
FYI - I was very skeptical of this e-mail so I called the telephone
number and it really was Laura Katsis at work.  She said that she did 
write and send the e-mail in reaction to what her girlfriend told her.
This could still be a hoax, but I am taking it a little more seriously 
knowing that Laura is a real person who admits writing the e-mail and 
who stands behind what she wrote. ----- Forwarded by Lisa Kent/US/Fabtech

credibility in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to
all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a
month ago.
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was
understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely
emptied.
On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he
wished he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it
had to be like that.  The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her
not to get on any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls
on Halloween.  As soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called
the FBI and has since turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This
came from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last
night. 
 
I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with one of his warnings
being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the
second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same
information that I did.

"Transportation Pipeline Contracts","Hi Steve,
             
                I spoke to Jeff Hodge this morning. Jeff asked that I provide to you the pipeline contracts we will need to put into place for the East Trading desk as soon as possible after  we find out who is going to buy us.  As expected the pipelines would only provide us will shell sgreements but we would like to get a step ahead by having legal review them so we can hopefully turn them around quickly when credit is established with the new entity.  You should receive them this afternoon.  I am at X35775.

                                                                                                                    Thank you!

"RE:","Hi! 

         Sorry it has taken so long to respond but I took a few days of vacation.  Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading company.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  This is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible thing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else with our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a tragedy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad for all those people who lost everything including a job.  Dick has been retained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his job will eventually end.  We have no time frame for him.  Hope everything is going well for you and your family.  Take care!

Read each sentence slowly and think about it.

Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends
with a tear.

Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.

Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and
impossible to forget.

You can only go as far as you push.

Actions speak louder than words.

The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love,
love somebody else.

Don't let the past hold you back, you're missing the
good stuff.

Life's short. If you don't look around once in a while
you might miss it.

A BEST FRIEND is like a four leaf clover, HARD TO FIND
and LUCKY TO HAVE.

Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in
it.

BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us.

When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look
ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND
will
be there.

TRUE FRIENDSHIP ""NEVER"" ENDS. Friends are FOREVER.

Good friends are like stars....You don't always see
them, but you know they are always there.

Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love
with
your smile.

What do you do when the only person who can make you
stop crying is the person who made you cry?

Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.

Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then
it's not the end.

Most people walk in and out of your life, but only
friends leave footprints in your heart.

Send this on to everyone special in your life, even
the
people who really make you mad sometimes and to the
people whose lives you want to be in!!!

And send it back to the person who sent it too you
if they mean something to you !!

Remember, every minute spent angry is sixty seconds of
happiness wasted.


AWESOME PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust
God
that you are exactly where you are meant to be. ""I
believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to
our
feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to
fly.""

Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on
the
fourth day. Do not break this, please. There is no
cost,
but lots of rewards.

"RE: Note","Hi Aunt Mary and Uncle Bob,  

            Sorry it has taken me so long to write.  Life is not good here at Enron.  I have been asked to stay on until the company I work for is sold.  I have been told I will be a part of the new company in it's proposed format.  Many things can change between now and then and I am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people.  It was so sad the day they let all those people go.  I felt sad and guilty because I still had a job.  Dick's company has basically been shut down.  He was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business.  His job will eventually end but we have no time frame.  I know you are probably wondering about our financial situation.  We had sold all our Enron stock in our 401K some time ago so we have done ok.
             It is so wonderful that you will get to see everyone sometime during the holidays.  Please tell them hello and MERRY CHRISTMAS.  It sounds like everyone is doing well.  Michele is disappointed we are not coming home for Christmas but Dick is on call and he wants to work as long as possible.  He keeps saying he is going to retire but I think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if I am still working.  I wish I could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing.  Take care.

All our love.

P.S.  Next time I write I promise to be more upbeat.

Dear Andy, 
Have been reading about the troubles at Enron, hope this hasn't affected your job. 
Are you and Dick going to Omaha for Christmas? Lisa, Billy and Madison will be here on the 23rd and stay for about a week. Steve, Lenora and the boys can't come until the week after Christmas. It's a very busy time of year for Steve, at work.  
Lori, Jeff and their families will be here as usual. 
Did you have a good Thanksgiving? We had a nice quiet day, just Lori, Jeff and their families. Lisa and Billy stayed in Austin this year as it has been a very busy football season for them. 
Jeff and Marsha are back together and seem to be getting along very well. They got a new puppy last week. It's an 11 week old female, yellow Labrador. They named her Gypsy. She is really cute but is going to get pretty big. Oh well, not my problem. 
Hope this finds you and Dick doing well. 
Love, Aunt Mary Lou 
P.S. Uncle Bob sends his love. 
P.P.S. Come see us anytime!!!!
