Subject:	MTM Income

I am currently responsible for the following companies:

20R
20Q
890
1572

In preparing our monthly tax accrual closing entries, I have noticed that the MTM activity on each of the above referenced companies does not roll between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet.  There are PRM assets on each of the companies (except 20R) and there is unrealized revenue on each of the companies (except 1572).  However, the change in activity on the balance sheet does not equal the income that is recognized in the 4200-0000 account.  I have attached a spreadsheet detailing the B/S accounts that I am looking at, as well as the amounts booked in account 4200-0000 on each company.  There is a difference of 15,886,556 that I cannot explain.  For tax purposes, I am currently reversing the amounts related to the balance sheet accounts, but I need to know where the offset is for the 15,886,556 appearing on the income statement.

Please let me know if you have any information concerning this issue.  Thank you.

Subject:	Cumulative Build for 3's and 4's 

Mary,  I have eight companies that are ranked as 3's.  Below are the dates I have tentatively marked down for CB meetings.  Since you are the only required attendee, I have not reserved meeting rooms at this point.  I think all the 17th floor rooms are pretty well booked anyway.  I was thinking we could meet in your cube to discuss these companies on the given dates.  

Company #		Date

551			11/14
1572			11/19 (this is the same day as company 20R.  we might be able to do them at the same time)
47E			11/20
890			11/26
986			11/29
1095			12/5

003 			12/13 (these are both divisions of 367)
1700			12/13  


In addition to these companies, I have the following tentative dates planned for my 4's:

Company #		Date

1573			11/26 (the same day as 890.  both are divisions of 985)

1407			11/28

1650			12/18 (these are all the same type of company, and do not have much activity at all)
1688			12/18
1690			12/18
1691			12/18
1699			12/18


Let me know your thoughts/availability for these dates.  I figure we can plan a time around when you are free on each specific day.

Mary, I'm not sure what accounting is doing.  The entry below is not complete.  For third quarter close company 33R received proceeds of $138,475,829 for SO2 credits.  The credits are held in inventory on company 33Q, the mark-to-market revenue for the SO2 is reported on 33R.

The attached workbook is my best guess of the tax basis in the credits ($104.8 million); the tax gain should be about $33.7 million.

Can you check with your accounting contacts for company 33R to get a complete picture of the accounting entries?

I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.

18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
	This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.  The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.  There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.

86M - Enron Net Works LLC
	Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.  Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.

The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.

80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.  Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.  83N is my responsibility.
	I think this entity should stay with 83N.  So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.  It should be 4 - easy.

1579 - EBS Network Co.
	Division of 17H.  This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.  Not currently on our list of companies.
	I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).  4 - easy.

1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1179.
	A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.  4 - easy.

1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.  4 - easy.

1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1307.
	Same as 1307.  It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  4 - easy.

Point of clarification:  There are several business units that are adamant  in their position against registering for state income/franchise taxes; therefore we are instructed to register for sales/use taxes if we determine the need to do so.  The registering for income and other taxes will be determined and handled by each business unit.  When we do register for sales/use tax, we notify the respective business unit and then they can register for their purposes according to their position.

Mary.  I have more information on the status of this entity with the state of Oklahoma.  The State did acknowledge receiving the documents for which you sent the evidence to me yesterday.  However, they indicate that the $15 reinstatement fee was not paid, nor was the initial business registration booklet filed.  We will remain suspended until those documents are filed.  

Lynda - I think that you might be the one who would handle the initial business registration booklet, but I am not sure.  If neither you nor Mary are the appropriate ones to contact about these matters, will you please advise who is.

It would also be a good idea that when those documents are ready to be filed that a copy of the cancelled check, front and back, that accompanied the documents you sent in August be attached with an explanatory cover letter so the state can put all the pieces back together.  If you would like to pass the completed documents through me for filing, I will be happy to take care of getting them to NRAI for filing.
If you believe that these documents have been filed and that we should be in good standing, you may want to contact the State directly at 405 521-3161. 
Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Facundo:   See the note below.   Please note that you will need to reverse the book loss recorded on the upper tier entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn and Grizzley) for the purchase of the lower tier entities in the amount of about $600 million.   In place of the reversal of the book loss, you should record a tax Schedule M to deduct the same (about $600 million) of interest expense.   I am working with Essie to determine which entities will report how much of the $600 million purchase price.   Thanks, John.

Essie:

The purpose of this message is to communicate to you, for co-ordination with the appropriate ""MARC"" personnel, the relevant facts of the transactions that closed on Friday, September 28, to unwind the Raptor structures.  As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.

Each of the ""top tier"" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) ""purchased"" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the ""bottom tier"" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively).  Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000.  As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures).  

For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine).  The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument.  Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity.  For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil.  

We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books.  Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message.  

Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10.  Thanks!

Raptor I		Harrier I LLC		$406,326,409
Raptor II	Grizzly I LLC		$15,531,889
Raptor III	Pronghorn I LLC		$309,508,781
Raptor IV	Roadrunner I LLC	($20,772,742)

I thought I would forward this to you for any comments you may want to weigh in with.  Patty and I have already examined the potential changes to state apportionment and taxes based on 2000 numbers and determined there is little impact.  If 2002 is as big a loss year for the PBM group as 2001 is shaping up to be, there may be some NOL's that Limbach will utilize.  Let me know if you have any questions, concerns or comments.

We are planning on merging the PBM group into Limbach Company.  However, I need to know from each of your departments what needs to be done, if anything, to accomplish this.  The plan is to continue using PBM, Marlin and MEPS as DBA's, but their financial information will consolidate into Limbach company's.  I assume that this may affect contracts, dissolution papers will need to be filed etc.  Please let me know what your individual department will need to do in order to facilitate this event.  Mike Angel will gather all necessary information on October 26 (or sooner if you have it) and continue to follow up on each unresolved matter until completion.  Please let me know if you know of any reason(s) that this merger cannot take place from your particular perspective.  Assuming their are no definite roadblocks, the merger will effectively take place on 1/2/02.

"Sale of S02 credits","Nicole,

After thinking about our conversation this morning I don't think that we are on the same page.  I am looking for a sale of S02 credits that were sold by 33R but were held in inventory on 33Q.

Eloise Williams sent an e-mail to Jeff Herrold saying that an entry was made to the following accounts on 33Q:

Debit to 1999995 	Cash				$138,475,829.50
Credit to 4500000	Other Commodity - Third Party	$138,475,829.50

My question is was the sale reclassed to 30R by the following entry:
33Q	Debit to 450160000	Financial Settlements - Intercompany 	$151,404,038.50
	Credit to 20023000	Accts Rec/Payable Non Trade - Interco	$151,404,038.50

33R	Debit to 20023000	Accts Rec/Payable Non Trade - Interco	$151,404,038.50
	Credit to 450160000	Financial Settlements - Intercompany	$151,404,038.50

If so what else makes up the $151,404,038.50?

My next question is what is the cost of  the inventory that went to cost of sales for the sale of $138,475,829.50 S02 credits?  What was the entry that recorded the amount into cost of sales?

If you could get back to me as soon as possible, I would greatly appreciate it.

Mary

Mary.  I have more information on the status of this entity with the state of Oklahoma.  The State did acknowledge receiving the documents for which you sent the evidence to me yesterday.  However, they indicate that the $15 reinstatement fee was not paid, nor was the initial business registration booklet filed.  We will remain suspended until those documents are filed.  

Lynda - I think that you might be the one who would handle the initial business registration booklet, but I am not sure.  If neither you nor Mary are the appropriate ones to contact about these matters, will you please advise who is.

It would also be a good idea that when those documents are ready to be filed that a copy of the cancelled check, front and back, that accompanied the documents you sent in August be attached with an explanatory cover letter so the state can put all the pieces back together.  If you would like to pass the completed documents through me for filing, I will be happy to take care of getting them to NRAI for filing.
If you believe that these documents have been filed and that we should be in good standing, you may want to contact the State directly at 405 521-3161. 
Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Subject:	FLOOR MEETING

At the Global Accounting Leadership Conference a few weeks ago, Rick Causey conducted a ""group conversation"" in which he discussed several topics that he knew would be of interest to the group and fielded questions from the group on a variety of topics.  All of this was done in a very informal setting, with a free flow of information between Rick and the participants.  The attendees agreed this was a very good forum for communication.

I would like to give the entire Tax department the same opportunity.  Rick has scheduled October 30th from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in EB1701.  Since space is limited, please reserve a spot by contacting Bobbie Moody via email only.  If more people sign up than the room will comfortably hold, we will schedule an additional meeting(s).  (You will receive a confirmation or a notice that you will be given another opportunity to attend a future meeting.)  Preference will be given to those who did not attend the Global Accounting Leadership Conference, which means that few of the Senior Directors or above will be at the meeting if there is a sizeable response.

In addition, while Rick will be happy to take questions at the discussion, feel free to submit questions in advance to Bobbie, to Melissa Becker (VP Human Capital Management for Global Accounting), or directly to Rick.  Questions directed to Melissa or Bobbie will be compiled and sent without names to Rick.  Alternatively, you may deliver your questions in an envelope to Bobbie (EB1747), Melissa (EB1769) or Rick (EB5023).  All topics are fair game.

In reviewing the close schedule, I noticed that my CB meeting is currently scheduled on the day before close.  If it is convenient for all of you, I would like to move the meeting to Oct. 16.  The time will still be 9:00-11:00.  Please let me know if this presents a conflict.  If it does, we will keep the meeting as is.

Subject:	MTM Income

I am currently responsible for the following companies:

20R
20Q
890
1572

In preparing our monthly tax accrual closing entries, I have noticed that the MTM activity on each of the above referenced companies does not roll between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet.  There are PRM assets on each of the companies (except 20R) and there is unrealized revenue on each of the companies (except 1572).  However, the change in activity on the balance sheet does not equal the income that is recognized in the 4200-0000 account.  I have attached a spreadsheet detailing the B/S accounts that I am looking at, as well as the amounts booked in account 4200-0000 on each company.  There is a difference of 15,886,556 that I cannot explain.  For tax purposes, I am currently reversing the amounts related to the balance sheet accounts, but I need to know where the offset is for the 15,886,556 appearing on the income statement.

Please let me know if you have any information concerning this issue.  Thank you.

Subject:	Data Income Plugs in Period 0012  --  OTP NEEDED ON RTA

The attached query lists companies that used plugs in TIS Period 0012 to correct income on their returns.  These plugs to income do not pull thru to the Management Summary Report or Provision Window in TIS, and thus the plugged income is not included in the Period 0012 tax calculations.  

To correct Period 0012 taxes in TIS, you must manually calculate the taxes related to the missing income in TIS and create an OTP (M Class Code 431 100 100/105 for CFIT, and 431 100 120/125 for CSIT) in Period 0012.  Do not include the federal benefit on state taxes when calculating your Federal OTP.  TIS will calculate the benefit on the State OTP automatically.  The OTP's should have already been done when the return was completed and the RTA was analyzed.  Please contact me if you still need to make these entries, and we will get these companies unlocked in 0012.  

Please contact me if you have any questions.

"Daisy Chistolini","Dana,

I was suppose to do this a week ago.  Daisy is a friend of mine and she couldn't beleive that out of all the people at Enron I knew who you were.  She wanted me to ask you for your address so that she and Kim (who used to work for you but I can't remember her last name) could invite your wife to Accessory Cafe party that they are having at Kim's house.  Daisy said that they tried to send an invitation to Accessory Cafe party that was held at Daisy's house but the invitation was returned.  They had some nice things so I recommend it.  If you want to call Daisy directly her number is:  713-975-0250.  

Its a small world.

Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization?  If possible, can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5?

Subject:	Entity Changes

I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.

18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
	This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.  The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.  There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.

86M - Enron Net Works LLC
	Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.  Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.

The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.

80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.  Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.  83N is my responsibility.
	I think this entity should stay with 83N.  So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.  It should be 4 - easy.

1579 - EBS Network Co.
	Division of 17H.  This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.  Not currently on our list of companies.
	I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).  4 - easy.

1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1179.
	A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.  4 - easy.

1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.  4 - easy.

1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1307.
	Same as 1307.  It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  4 - easy.



Let me know if you have any questions.
