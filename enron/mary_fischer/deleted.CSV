"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

We had agreed to get together on Tuesday to finish our discussion on the TNPC wanrrants and the unwind of the Raptor structure.  I am suggesting that we get together on Tuesday morning at 8:00.  Please let me know if that works for everyone.

Outstanding issues: 
        How will the FAS 125/140 transactions related to the warrants unwind on EES?  Have they been unwound as part of the September writedown?

        Do the deferred taxes on Raptor after the September entries relate to the basis in the warrants transferred out of Raptor (73 million)?  Where did this amount get transferred?

        What are the deferred taxes that remain on the books of the Raptor entities after September, 2001? 

Any other topics? 

Anne - can you reserve EB1701 at 8:00 on Tuesday morning for us? 

Thanks,

Subject:	Entity Changes

I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.

18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
	This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.  The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.  There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.

86M - Enron Net Works LLC
	Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.  Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.

The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.

80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.  Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.  83N is my responsibility.
	I think this entity should stay with 83N.  So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.  It should be 4 - easy.

1579 - EBS Network Co.
	Division of 17H.  This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.  Not currently on our list of companies.
	I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).  4 - easy.

1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1179.
	A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.  4 - easy.

1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.  4 - easy.

1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1307.
	Same as 1307.  It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  4 - easy.

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

"Raptor Deferred Tax Liability Balances","John,

After my calculations the deferred tax variance ended up being
18,503,872 versus our previous
variance of 53,535,100. I calculated Friday's hyperion Tax Liability
Accounts on the Balance Sheet
and made adjustments for the current taxes booked (which I will reverse
next close). I will come
tommorrow morning before your meeting at 8:00 am to compare my
calculation to actual balances
and make any adjustments if necessary if needed.  I have attached the
spreadsheet to this document.
I placed a hard copy of the spreadsheet on your desk. Have a good
evening.

"Clarification:  Entering Payments & Refunds in TIS","In last week's Monthly Close Process Overview training class, we discussed the payment and refund functionality in TIS.  It has come to my attention that one more clarifying point needs to be made.  Please allow me to explain the circumstances of the issue.

The Consolidations group is gathering payment and refund information for the 10Q (the quarterly SEC report).  In the 10Q, we have to provide the amount of payments we made and refunds we received by quarter.  When gathering the information for the 3rd quarter, the Consolidations group noticed that prior quarter information changed in TIS.  Since we cannot go back and change the information that we reported for the 1st or 2nd quarter 10Qs, those new payments/refunds have to be reported in the 3rd quarter.  Now, our YTD TIS report does not tie to the information we provided for the 10Q.

To keep the TIS report consistent from quarter to quarter, please do not add a payment or refund in TIS to a prior quarter.  For example, as of today, we are still finalizing September business (the 3rd quarter).  If you realized today that a refund should have been entered in TIS for May business, do not enter that refund in May business.  Enter it in July business (the closest month in the next quarter).  If, however, you realized today that a payment should be entered in August business, you can enter that payment in August business because August is part of the 3rd quarter which is the quarter we are currently reporting.  Please note that it is OK to change the description of a prior quarter payment or refund.  Just don't change any dollar amounts or add any new amounts.

This issue just reemphasizes the need to tie out our TIS subledgers to general ledger every month.  If we analyze the differences every month and enter the payments/refunds every month, this should not be a problem.

SPECIAL NOTE:  The Consolidations group has finalized the 3rd quarter payment and refund information for the 10Q that is due tomorrow.  If you need to make any changes to payment / refund amounts in TIS, please contact Mary Sontag.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Subject:	Entity Changes

I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.

18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
	This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.  The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.  There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.

86M - Enron Net Works LLC
	Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.  Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.

The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.

80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.  Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.  83N is my responsibility.
	I think this entity should stay with 83N.  So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.  It should be 4 - easy.

1579 - EBS Network Co.
	Division of 17H.  This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.  Not currently on our list of companies.
	I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).  4 - easy.

1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1179.
	A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.  4 - easy.

1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.  4 - easy.

1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1307.
	Same as 1307.  It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  4 - easy.



Let me know if you have any questions.

"FLOOR MEETING","At the Global Accounting Leadership Conference a few weeks ago, Rick Causey conducted a ""group conversation"" in which he discussed several topics that he knew would be of interest to the group and fielded questions from the group on a variety of topics.  All of this was done in a very informal setting, with a free flow of information between Rick and the participants.  The attendees agreed this was a very good forum for communication.

I would like to give the entire Tax department the same opportunity.  Rick has scheduled October 30th from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in EB1701.  Since space is limited, please reserve a spot by contacting Bobbie Moody via email only.  If more people sign up than the room will comfortably hold, we will schedule an additional meeting(s).  (You will receive a confirmation or a notice that you will be given another opportunity to attend a future meeting.)  Preference will be given to those who did not attend the Global Accounting Leadership Conference, which means that few of the Senior Directors or above will be at the meeting if there is a sizeable response.

In addition, while Rick will be happy to take questions at the discussion, feel free to submit questions in advance to Bobbie, to Melissa Becker (VP Human Capital Management for Global Accounting), or directly to Rick.  Questions directed to Melissa or Bobbie will be compiled and sent without names to Rick.  Alternatively, you may deliver your questions in an envelope to Bobbie (EB1747), Melissa (EB1769) or Rick (EB5023).  All topics are fair game.

"Follow up on TNPC meeting","We had agreed to get together on Tuesday to finish our discussion on the TNPC wanrrants and the unwind of the Raptor structure.  I am suggesting that we get together on Tuesday morning at 8:00.  Please let me know if that works for everyone.

Outstanding issues:
	How will the FAS 125/140 transactions related to the warrants unwind on EES?  Have they been unwound as part of the September writedown?

	Do the deferred taxes on Raptor after the September entries relate to the basis in the warrants transferred out of Raptor (73 million)?  Where did this amount get transferred?

	What are the deferred taxes that remain on the books of the Raptor entities after September, 2001?

Any other topics?

Anne - can you reserve EB1701 at 8:00 on Tuesday morning for us?

Thanks,

Patty

"Organizational Changes","Re: Organizational Changes

Over the last several quarters, EES has successfully implemented a number of new business models, organizational structures and processes.  The result has been tremendous customer contracting in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe in 2001.  In all cases, EES's large consumer market share has expanded and we have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consumer market - Enron Direct.  This effort, in itself is impressive, especially given that at the same time, EES has had to significantly restructure and re-tool its execution capabilities, systems and mid and back offices.  I can assure you that these processes, systems and capabilities are improving.  This is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES, EES risk and Enron Networks.

In that light, I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes which demonstrate our continued commitment to the European market and the creation of a new exciting channel in the Enron Direct USA business.

A)	EES Europe:

Effective immediately, Sean Holmes will be moving to London to manage EES Europe.  We believe that Sean has the broad based experience in the EES business model, products, retail energy risk management and demand side management to take the European business to next level. Charlie Crossley-Cooke will manage our small consumer (Enron Direct) franchise.  This franchise has continued to grow, in the UK and on the continent, and has provided significant income to EES in 2001. Enron Direct will also continue to provide mid and back office services to EES Europe. Paul Turner will manage our large consumer business in Western Europe.  Paul will be replacing Stuart Rexrode who will be returning to EES in Houston.  Over the last few quarters, our penetration of this market, primarily in the UK, has grown dramatically with completed contracts with Sainsbury, Guiness, Kraft and Pirelli.  Many of these transactions include gas, power and demand side management.  We would like to thank Stuart for all his hard work toward the continued growth of the European franchise.

We are also pleased to announce the formation of the European Product Group led by Roy Poyntz.  This group will lead the development of new products and services for both the large and small consumer markets.  As in North America, its main role will be to ensure viable and innovative products are continually available in the pipeline to ensure the continued growth of the European business. The Product Group will also ensure product diversity between gas, power and energy efficiency products.  We continue to be committed to the development of the demand side management aspects of our business to differentiate us from our competitors. On a final note, the EES Europe commodity structuring and DSM groups will now report to Sean in addition to Charlie, Paul and Roy. 

As part of this change, Deb Merrill will be assuming the lead role in Deal Management in EES USA replacing Sean.  Deb has been an integral part of EES from many years and we believe she has all the experience and skill sets to effectively manage and build on this integral function in EES USA.

B)	Enron Direct USA - Dealer Network

Effective immediately, Stuart Rexrode will manage this new sales channel inside Enron Direct USA.  Stuart will be building this new more sophisticated agent selling channel by creating franchise like relationships with numerous ""dealers"" across the US.  This dealer network will consist of small knowledgeable entrepreneurs and consultants that have been in the energy markets for many years and have great regional expertise and customer relationships. EES will provide a franchise like program where we provide resources and products to this agent base in exchange for exclusive provision of sales services and customer aggregation.  We hope that this network can provide the customer acquisition velocity and low cost acquisition model benefits of the mass market agents but provide a more sophisticated agent in front of larger clients in order to sell higher value products that include gas, power and DSM.  Phyllis Anzalone and her team are already working on the development of this dealer network and will become part of this group reporting to Stuart.  Phyllis and her team deserve a lot of credit for the identification and build out to date of this newest business model in EES.

In conclusion, everyday we are getting better and more effective.  We should be very pleased with the financial and operating performance of EES for 2001.  We have an EBIT target of $75 million for Q4 which is only $4 million higher than Q3, We will finish the year at approximately $247 million.  This is approximately 10% over 2001 plan and 120% growth in recurring earnings year on year.  The business model is working and we are one step closer to the goal of becoming the leading global energy retailer.  The All-Employee meeting will be on November 1 where we look forward to discussing with you our operational and financial results for 2001 and our plan, strategies and objectives for 2002.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Subject:	Unranked Entities

Everyone:

There are still approximately 300 unranked entities.  These entities need to be ranked by noon tomorrow.  All entities that are still unranked after tomorrow will automatically be assigned a ranking level of ""4"".

Since, this will ultimately affect resources allocated to your groups, it would be in everybody's best interest to assign the proper rankings to the Master Workplan at this time.

It would also be a good idea to make sure the preparers/reviewers are assigned, since there are still many empty fields.  Don't forget to update TIS entity maintenance fields to match the workplan data.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"American Heart Walk Donations","Just think!  After tomorrow you won't have to get these e-mails from me anymore about the American Heart Walk until I send one to  remind you about the walk on Nov. 3 and the party at my house afterwards.

Anyways, I will be here tomorrow (Friday, 10/26), but will be participating in Fabulous Friday from about noon until about 5:00 p.m.  So if you can bring me your envelopes in the a.m. that would be wonderful!  If, however, you can't bring the envelopes until after lunch, please give them to Shelly Jones in EB1756.

By the way, I don't think that I forwarded the ""prize list"" to you ... but I do believe that everyone receives a prize based on the amount they collect.  The prizes are pretty cool.  Here is the prize list:

	 
The prize amount is determined based on dollars actually collected, plus Enron matching dollars for Enron employees only.  In other words, if you collect a total of $300, with $200 of that from Enron employees and $100 from a friend outside Enron, then the total ""prize dollars"" is $500 ($300 actual dollars plus $200 Enron match).

Please let me know your availability for a meeting on Friday morning from 8:00 until 10:00.  We are scheduled in EB1701.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the various entities that have recorded taxes related to the TNPC stock and warrants.  As identitfed below, please bring an analysis of the activity - life to date - of the taxes recorded, by entity, by period, by event.  We will develop an analysis of the steps that will be necessary as the various transactions related to the stock and warrants are unwound.

John Swafford/Danny Wilson - Raptor activity through September business prior to any write-offs booked at quarter end

Bill Bowes/Shanna Husser - FAS 125 transactions recorded related to the warrants

Shanna Husser/Patty Lee - stock and warrant transactions related to initial placement and EES activity, including the original SAB 51 gain, the tax gain on the warrants, and the equity losses recorded to date

We also want to determine the impact of the write-off anticipated for the third quarter and what the deferred tax requirements will be after the Raptor structure is unwound.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

3 class times available
Tues, Oct. 23   8:00 a.m.
Tues, Oct. 23  1:30 p.m.
Wed, Oct. 24  9:00 a.m.
EB1701

This course will offer an overview of the 14 workday monthly close process including specific discussions on general ledger close, topside close, roll forward, and on-going analysis and maintenance.  Frequently asked questions that should be answered after this course include:
	What are the different systems that we use (SAP, ECCS, TIS, Hyperion, Tax Data Warehouse, Corptax, TKS)?
	How do I read the close schedule that the TST sends out every month?
	When are final pre-tax SAP reports available for viewing?
	What is the deadline for writing DARS rules?
	What is a topside entry?
	What posting level should I use when writing a report out of ECCS?
	And many others...
	
Two additional classes will be offered soon discussing the specific TIS activities that occur on the 8th workday (general ledger close) and the 10th and 12th workdays (topside close).   Watch your email for notification of course times.

All members of the MARC and BAR teams are encouraged to attend.  All three classes will cover identical material, so attendance is only necessary at one class.  Please arrive 10 minutes early to allow time to sign in and obtain materials.  Classes will start promptly at the time indicated above.

Please sign up through the October training calendar on the tax web page at  http://tax.enron.com/.  Classes are limited to 35 attendees.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Anything left in either of the refrigerators after 1pm tomorrow, Friday, will be thrown out as I am cleaning them out with Kitchen Lysol so we can have a clean and healthy place to put our lunches. Please in the future, if you do not plan to eat your meals you put in the fridge within two days, remove it as it will be discarded after two days. Lately, the odor has been unbearable coming from the fridges and I do not want to place my meals in a contaminated and dirty refrigerator and I am sure most of you feel the same way.

Wed, Oct. 31   9:00 a.m.
Thurs, Nov 1  2:00 p.m.
Tues, Nov 6  9:00 a.m.
EB1702

This course will offer a hands-on review of the activities that occur on the 8th workday for general ledger close.  Specific topics that will be covered include:
	Printing trial balances out of SAP
	Developing an accrual template
	Reviewing DARS adjustments in TIS
	Creating an Other Adjustment in TIS
	Reviewing the voucher
	Executing certain ad hoc queries
	Reviewing tax and book roll-up information
	Tieing out TIS to SAP

This training course will be in the Training Room (EB1702), so the participants will actually perform each of the activities listed above.  Who should attend?  All parties that are directly involved with preparing income tax accruals utilizing TIS are encouraged to attend.  

As usual, all three classes will cover identical materials, so attendance is only necessary at one class.  Since this is a hands-on class, each class will be limited to 20 with the more-experienced users watching and assisting the newer users.  

A majority of the analysts that will be attending this training course will be out of the office the week of November 5 for the CPA exam.  If you are certified already or will be in the office on Nov 6, please sign up for that course if at all possible leaving spaces in the other 2 classes for analysts that will be out for the exam.

Subject:	Entity Changes

I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.

18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
	This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.  The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.  There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.

86M - Enron Net Works LLC
	Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.  Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.

The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.

80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.  Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.  83N is my responsibility.
	I think this entity should stay with 83N.  So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.  It should be 4 - easy.

1579 - EBS Network Co.
	Division of 17H.  This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.  Not currently on our list of companies.
	I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).  4 - easy.

1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1179.
	A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.  4 - easy.

1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.  4 - easy.

1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1307.
	Same as 1307.  It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  4 - easy.



Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	FLOOR MEETING

At the Global Accounting Leadership Conference a few weeks ago, Rick Causey conducted a ""group conversation"" in which he discussed several topics that he knew would be of interest to the group and fielded questions from the group on a variety of topics.  All of this was done in a very informal setting, with a free flow of information between Rick and the participants.  The attendees agreed this was a very good forum for communication.

I would like to give the entire Tax department the same opportunity.  Rick has scheduled October 30th from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in EB1701.  Since space is limited, please reserve a spot by contacting Bobbie Moody via email only.  If more people sign up than the room will comfortably hold, we will schedule an additional meeting(s).  (You will receive a confirmation or a notice that you will be given another opportunity to attend a future meeting.)  Preference will be given to those who did not attend the Global Accounting Leadership Conference, which means that few of the Senior Directors or above will be at the meeting if there is a sizeable response.

In addition, while Rick will be happy to take questions at the discussion, feel free to submit questions in advance to Bobbie, to Melissa Becker (VP Human Capital Management for Global Accounting), or directly to Rick.  Questions directed to Melissa or Bobbie will be compiled and sent without names to Rick.  Alternatively, you may deliver your questions in an envelope to Bobbie (EB1747), Melissa (EB1769) or Rick (EB5023).  All topics are fair game.

DEAR ACCOUNTING RESEARCH MANAGER (TM) SUBSCRIBER:

The October 12 - 18, 2001 edition of the Accounting Research Manager Weekly
Summary is now available. You can access the headlines, summary paragraphs
and links of the Weekly Summary below. You can access the fully-formatted
version of the Weekly Summary at the following address:
http://www.arm.arthurandersen.com/rschmgr.nsf/?Open&M=vwUID/EB2DAC14


THIS WEEK'S HEADLINES:

 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS/GOODWILL/REVENUE - FASB AND SEC ISSUE GUIDANCE
ADDRESSING VARIOUS ISSUES
The SEC and FASB have issued the following guidance addressing business
combinations, goodwill/other intangible assets and revenue recognition
matters:

FASB ISSUES PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
The FASB staff has issued proposed implementation guidance on FASB
Statements No. 141, Business Combinations , and No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets . Paragraph 61(b) of Statement 141 requires that the
carrying amount of certain intangible assets be reclassified and accounted
for as assets apart from goodwill as of the date Statement 142 is adopted
in its entirety. The FASB staff's proposed announcement would clarify that
the phrase ""accounting records have been maintained"" as used in footnote 25
to paragraph 61(b) is intended to mean that an entity is accounting for an
acquired intangible asset separately from goodwill as evidenced by the
maintenance of separate general ledger accounts, subsidiary ledgers, or
spreadsheets for that intangible asset to which it posted periodic
amortization charges, impairment charges, and any other accounting entries
related to that asset.
http://www.arm.arthurandersen.com/rschmgr.nsf/?Open&M=vwUID/C8D759A8

SEC ISSUES UPDATE TO CURRENT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE ISSUES
In October 2001, the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance issued the
August 31, 2001 update of Current Accounting and Disclosure Issues . This
document provides guidance to companies on hot disclosure and accounting
topics.
http://www.arm.arthurandersen.com/rschmgr.nsf/?Open&M=vwUID/0A25ACAA

SEC FOREIGN ISSUERS - SEC PROPSES  EDGAR FILING FOR FOREIGN ISSUERS
On September 25, 2001, the SEC proposed a rule that would require foreign
private issuers and foreign governments to file electronically on the SEC's
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system the
documents they file under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Currently, the rules permit, but do not require,
foreign issuers to file their documents electronically. In addition, the
proposal would require foreign private issuers to translate into English
all foreign language documents filed with the SEC. Currently, the rules
permit the filing of certain foreign language documents that are
accompanied by an English language summary. This Literature Update (a)
describes the significant changes that would be introduced and (b) adds the
release to SEC Practice.
http://www.arm.arthurandersen.com/rschmgr.nsf/?Open&M=vwUID/41306D67

"RE: SO2 Reclass Entry - Correction","Mary:   Unless you hear from me in the next hour, please close 33R and 33Q without making an adjustment for the $104.8 million of tax basis in inventory.   Tom Meyers said that he would see whether or not the cost of inventory has been expensed for book and if not, then he will make an adjustment in Hyperion and we would tax effect his adjustment.

Per my conversation with Eloise Williams the proceeds of $138,475,829 were never recorded on 33R but were recorded on 33Q.  Since this is a sale of inventory I'm assuming that the gain will be ordinary and should be reduced by the tax basis in the credits of $104.8 million.

Mary, I'm not sure what accounting is doing.  The entry below is not complete.  For third quarter close company 33R received proceeds of $138,475,829 for SO2 credits.  The credits are held in inventory on company 33Q, the mark-to-market revenue for the SO2 is reported on 33R.

The attached workbook is my best guess of the tax basis in the credits ($104.8 million); the tax gain should be about $33.7 million.

Can you check with your accounting contacts for company 33R to get a complete picture of the accounting entries?

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Monthly Close Process Overview 

3 class times available
Tues, Oct. 23   8:00 a.m.  EB1701 
Tues, Oct. 23  1:30 p.m.  EB1701
Wed, Oct. 24  9:30 a.m.  EB49C2

This course will offer an overview of the 14 workday monthly close process including specific discussions on general ledger close, topside close, roll forward, and on-going analysis and maintenance.  Frequently asked questions that should be answered after this course include:
	What are the different systems that we use (SAP, ECCS, TIS, Hyperion, Tax Data Warehouse, Corptax, TKS)?
	How do I read the close schedule that the TST sends out every month?
	When are final pre-tax SAP reports available for viewing?
	What is the deadline for writing DARS rules?
	What is a topside entry?
	What posting level should I use when writing a report out of ECCS?
	And many others...
	
Two additional classes will be offered soon discussing the specific TIS activities that occur on the 8th workday (general ledger close) and the 10th and 12th workdays (topside close).   Watch your email for notification of course times.

All members of the MARC and BAR teams are encouraged to attend.  All three classes will cover identical material, so attendance is only necessary at one class.  Please arrive 10 minutes early to allow time to sign in and obtain materials.  Classes will start promptly at the time indicated above.

Please sign up through the October training calendar on the tax web page at  http://tax.enron.com/.  Classes are limited to 35 attendees.

"Formation of The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services Group","We are pleased to announce that EES, FieldCentrix and a group of outside investors have formed a new company to be referred to as The Facility Services Group.  This group is charged with creating a national service network to provide predictable and scalable repair, maintenance and other facilities services for retail customers, including many of EES's existing and future customers.  The Facility Services Group is expanding its vendor management platform to allow service technicians to focus on efficient, predictable service while capturing data on a real time basis and will provide scalable execution capability for the vendor management and O&M products.  We expect these products and services to create significant value.

The Facility Services Group includes Enron Building Services, Inc. (EBSI), The Linc Company, the HVAC Services business (all three, formerly part of Enron Facility Services), Interactive Process Technologies (IPT) and FieldCentrix, Inc., a mobile workforce management software company.  The Management Team of the Facility Services Group will include existing management from these companies.

FieldCentrix is a leading provider of wireless, Internet-based field force automation software.  Founded in 1994, the 125-employee company was recently named one of Frontline Solutions Top 100 companies and also received the Cingular Best Solution award for 2001.  The Facility Services Group will use the FieldCentrix and IPT platforms to provide a superior predictive and preventative maintenance program through vendor management to customers.  Tracy Price, President and CEO of FieldCentrix, will lead The Facility Services Group.  

The remaining components of Enron Facility Services (EFS) will be re-organized into The Construction Services Group.  This group will be led by Steve Wurzel and will include: Limbach Facility Services, the Architecture & Engineering group and the Construction Management Services group.  The Construction Services Group will continue to provide Engineering and Construction Services to Third Parties and EES.  We expect this group to continue to be an important and valuable part of EES's financial performance.

Dave Whaley will continue to manage the shared services groups, including legal, finance, HR, and IT, across The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services Group.  The centralization and sharing of these support services is cost effective, scalable and responsive.  In addition, Dave will assist in the transition of the EFS companies to The Facility Services Group.

Joe Earle has decided to leave Enron at the end of this year.  Until then, Joe will continue to work with the line businesses and assist with the transition of the EFS companies to The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services group.  Under his leadership, EFS and all of its companies have continued to be leaders in their fields.  Please join us in thanking Joe for his 10 years of leadership with the EFS companies.  
The re-alignment of our activities and the creation of a new entity to focus solely on serving the $136 billion facility services market will assist our entire organization in achieving our 2002 and beyond goals and objectives.
