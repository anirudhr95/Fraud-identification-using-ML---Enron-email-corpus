"FW: Heart Walk - Last minute items...","Walkers:

I am not going to promise no more e-mails, because they keep sending them!  If they don't add any new info, I'm not forwarding to y'all.  However, this one mentions that anyone who collected > $500 can be a ""star walker,"" and should report to the ""star walker"" tent on the day of the walk.

So, if you plan to walk, collected > $500, and want to be a ""star walker,"" report to that tent the day of the walk.

Mary.  I have more information on the status of this entity with the state of Oklahoma.  The State did acknowledge receiving the documents for which you sent the evidence to me yesterday.  However, they indicate that the $15 reinstatement fee was not paid, nor was the initial business registration booklet filed.  We will remain suspended until those documents are filed.  

Lynda - I think that you might be the one who would handle the initial business registration booklet, but I am not sure.  If neither you nor Mary are the appropriate ones to contact about these matters, will you please advise who is.

It would also be a good idea that when those documents are ready to be filed that a copy of the cancelled check, front and back, that accompanied the documents you sent in August be attached with an explanatory cover letter so the state can put all the pieces back together.  If you would like to pass the completed documents through me for filing, I will be happy to take care of getting them to NRAI for filing.
If you believe that these documents have been filed and that we should be in good standing, you may want to contact the State directly at 405 521-3161. 
Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Hi John,

Transportation Trading Services Company (1755) is not set up in TIS, Hyperion or SAP so we won't close this month.

FYI
Enron Operations, LP (535) (fka Enron Operations Corp.) In TIS preparer and reviewer respectively, M. Morrow, S. Seelig.

Enron Transportation Services Company (1N9) (fka Enron Pipeline  Company) In TIS preparer and reviewer respectively, S.Husser, S. Seelig.

Transportation Trading Services Company (1755).

Per our conversation, Facundo Caminos and Mary Fischer will be the preparer and reviewer, respectively.


Hi Vicsandra, 

I did not find 535 or 1N9 in the Consolidated Workplan (the one that allows filtering). It appears 535 is a partnership and 1N9 is either a holding company or asset management company. See above regarding 535 assignment.

Please call me if you have any questions or need more information.

Thank,

"20Q's PRM","Cathy, I want to recap our conversation yesterday because, after I thought about it, I still do not  understand the issue with 20Q and its PRM:  

A credit reserve was set up for bad debts for $5,577,900 and credited to account 25100300 Prudency Reserve.  It is my understanding that this was the only way to book this transaction.  But I do not understand why this was booked in a PRM account and not booked to the Allowance for Bad Debts account.  Also, when I reduce the 25100300 account balance by the $5,577,900 that was booked there, my difference doubles to $11,155,800 (see attached spreadsheet).  So was account 25100300 originally credited or debited by the $5,577,900?  If it was originally debited and I remove that debit, then the PRM will roll.  Also, will there be anyway to move this transaction out of the PRM accounts in order to effectively roll these accounts every month?
 


Thanks for your help.

"What To Do Once You Receive Your Business Objects ID and Password","In the next few days, you will receive your ID and temporary password for the Financial Data Warehouse / Business Objects from the ISC.

When you do, take these three steps which will enable you to identify the additional reports and data items needed to perform your work: Logon and install Business Objects via the intranet; Review the existing Corporate Reports, and take the two ISC Training Courses for Business Objects (one is an on-line training courses available anytime and the other is a classroom style course where you get hands-on experience).


First, logon to the Project Sunrise website and install the Business Objects web client:
open your Microsoft Internet Explorer,
enter the Project Sunrise site address sunrise.corp.enron.com into the address field and press enter,
when prompted, enter your ID (with a capital P) and your temporary password
follow the directions in the ISC's instructions that will be sent with your ID/password to install Business Objects over the intranet.  (if this takes more than 3 minutes, call me at 3-9047).  DO NOT GET BUSINESS OBJECTS INSTALLED BY THE IT GROUP, AS THIS IS THE WRONG VERSION (WINDOWS).
then Refresh your Report List and start reviewing the reports.  The ISC's instructions will also cover the steps to select and run reports, (but please call me with any issues).


Second, review the existing reports in the ""Corporate Documents"" tab and identify the additional reports your need to perform your work and meet your customers' needs.  Current report subjects include Cost Centers, Project Systems and on or about November 1st  will also include Profit Centers, Consolidations, Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable.


Third, take the two training courses to learn how to analyze data in drill mode, add other data warehouse fields to existing reports, etc.  Once you have this ability, you can also determine which additional data fields need to be added to the Financial Data Warehouse to complete your reporting requirements.  To enroll in the on-line and classroom Business Objects courses,
Logon to the Enron Learning Management site elm.enron.com
scroll to the bottom of the first pages and select ISC Courses
Scroll down to the middle of page two, click on Business Objects and enroll in the following:
BusinessObjects  On-line Training Course for Financial Reporting  (BO 101)  Price - none
BusinessObjects  Financial Reporting Basics  (BO 202)  Price - $250  Classroom/hands-on training.
More information on training below and on ELM site.

Project Sunrise is in the process of identifying and designing its final deliverable now, so we need to identify our reporting needs quickly.

Facundo:   Essie and I will confirm with Donette tomorrow, but for the time being, plan on reversing the $710 million book loss on the entities listed below (if you determine that they were in fact booked) and include Schedule M adjustments to deduct as interest expense the purchase price paid by Harrier $6 mill., Roadrunner and Grizzly $15 mill. each, and Pronghorn $1,000 for the lower tier entities purchased from LJM. 

We will confirm and let you know before noon tomorrow.   Thanks, John.

I just talked to Ron Baker, who advised me that the total losses to be booked are $710,594,336 and they will be booked as follows:

Raptor I		Harrier I LLC		$406,326,409
Raptor II	Grizzly I LLC		$15,531,889
Raptor III	Pronghorn I LLC		$309,508,781
Raptor IV	Roadrunner I LLC	($20,772,742)

Please check SAP to see if the numbers have been booked before the close as Ron wasn't sure if they had been booked or not.

Facundo:   See the note below.   Please note that you will need to reverse the book loss recorded on the upper tier entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn and Grizzley) for the purchase of the lower tier entities in the amount of about $600 million.   In place of the reversal of the book loss, you should record a tax Schedule M to deduct the same (about $600 million) of interest expense.   I am working with Essie to determine which entities will report how much of the $600 million purchase price.   Thanks, John.

Essie:

The purpose of this message is to communicate to you, for co-ordination with the appropriate ""MARC"" personnel, the relevant facts of the transactions that closed on Friday, September 28, to unwind the Raptor structures.  As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.

Each of the ""top tier"" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) ""purchased"" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the ""bottom tier"" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively).  Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000.  As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures).  

For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine).  The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument.  Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity.  For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil.  

We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books.  Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message.  

Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10.  Thanks!

"Cumulative Build for 3's and 4's","Mary,  I have eight companies that are ranked as 3's.  Below are the dates I have tentatively marked down for CB meetings.  Since you are the only required attendee, I have not reserved meeting rooms at this point.  I think all the 17th floor rooms are pretty well booked anyway.  I was thinking we could meet in your cube to discuss these companies on the given dates.  

Company #		Date

551			11/14
1572			11/19 (this is the same day as company 20R.  we might be able to do them at the same time)
47E			11/20
890			11/26
986			11/29
1095			12/5

003 			12/13 (these are both divisions of 367)
1700			12/13  


In addition to these companies, I have the following tentative dates planned for my 4's:

Company #		Date

1573			11/26 (the same day as 890.  both are divisions of 985)

1407			11/28

1650			12/18 (these are all the same type of company, and do not have much activity at all)
1688			12/18
1690			12/18
1691			12/18
1699			12/18


Let me know your thoughts/availability for these dates.  I figure we can plan a time around when you are free on each specific day.

"Questions Related to 20Q","Chris,

I am not sure if you are the person to answer these questions or not, but I have your name as my contact.  I have a few questions regarding Company 20Q:

1.  Bad Debts Expense/Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:
	The balance sheet activity does not match the income statement activity.  The difference is roughly $10 million.  
	Could you please provide a detailed analysis of the following two accounts:
		52501000
		20017000
	
2.  Amortization:
	What does the expense in account 5700-0000 relate to?  I see that the monthly expense increased from 2,959 to 
	39,462 in April.  Did some new items appear?  If so, please explain the nature of the transactions.  I will need to 
	this information to ensure that our tax amortization is properly reflected for 2001.

3.  Deferred Debits:
	Please provide an explanation of what is in this account.

4.  State Apportionment:
	Please verify that the following amounts are truly foreign in nature (as evidenced by jurisdiction code 79).  I am asking for 
	verification so that I can be sure that my calculated state tax rate is correct.
		
		Account Number	Jurisdiction Code	Amount
		
		40001000		79			381,203
		40002000		79			(308,658,611)
		40005000		79			363,428,746
		45019000		79			(36,245,170)
		69000000		79			7,498



The answers to these questions may be as simple as providing E-schedules, or there may be more detail needed.  If you could have this information to me by November 15, I would greatly appreciate it.  If you have any questions or issues with this request, please call me at extension 53522.

"FW: Cancellation of 6 Limited Liability Companies","I'm forwarding the message below for your information.   The messages below advises of the Raptor entities are being dissolved, Harrier, Talon, Roadrunner, Bobcat, Grizzley, Timberwolf.   Additionally, the expectation is that there should be little or no activity in these companies post September close.   Would you let me know if there is any activity in these entities going forward.   If there is post-September activity, we will continue to make tax adjustments similar to what was in place before.

Patty/John:

Based on the message below, as well as on the copies of various termination agreements that we received today, I would not expect to see any post-September 30 accounting activity for the Raptor 1, 2, and 4 structures, other than what is necessary for dissolution.  All transactions among these entities themselves, as well as among any of these entities and Enron, have been terminated.  Query what accounting activity will take place to ""dissolve"" these entities?  What will happen to the deferred tax balances that have been booked on these entities?

With regard to Raptor 3, we understand that, at this point, the only transactions that have been terminated are the ISDA and confirmations between Enron Corp. and Porcupine, and the ISDA Master Agreements and confirmations between Pronghorn and Porcupine.  Both Pronghorn and Porcupine will remain in existence until the unwind of Tahiti.  Additionally, we understand that none of the notes between these two entities have been canceled.  Accordingly, accounting activity should still occur on these entities, but should relate only to the financings that remain in place and the TNPC warrants owned.  We will review the notes to determine which, if any, relate solely to Raptor (and therefore can be cancelled) and which relate solely to Tahiti (and therefore must remain in existence until the Tahiti unwind).

Subject:	RE: July 2001 MTM analysis


Attached is the MTM analysis that we have done by company and in total.  (includes entites: 1572, 890, 20Q, 20R)

As you can see from the schedules, we can not match the change in the balance sheet to the income statement activity for 2 of the companies.

For company 890, the difference is ($20,000,000)- Tax knows what this difference is and understands it- so no explanation/research is needed.

For company 20R, the difference is $5,577,900- this is the difference that we in tax don't understand.

I prepared the majority of these spreadsheets, so if you can't follow our analysis- please feel free to call me. (ext. 35736)

Tax has Hyperion Close on Tuesday, Aug 14th.  We will contact you that morning to see if this amount should change our current tax entries.

Thanks-
Shanna

"MTM Income","I am currently responsible for the following companies:

20R
20Q
890
1572

In preparing our monthly tax accrual closing entries, I have noticed that the MTM activity on each of the above referenced companies does not roll between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet.  There are PRM assets on each of the companies (except 20R) and there is unrealized revenue on each of the companies (except 1572).  However, the change in activity on the balance sheet does not equal the income that is recognized in the 4200-0000 account.  I have attached a spreadsheet detailing the B/S accounts that I am looking at, as well as the amounts booked in account 4200-0000 on each company.  There is a difference of 15,886,556 that I cannot explain.  For tax purposes, I am currently reversing the amounts related to the balance sheet accounts, but I need to know where the offset is for the 15,886,556 appearing on the income statement.

Please let me know if you have any information concerning this issue.  Thank you.

"Re: Construction Interest moved from 20R to 15A","
I wasn't sure where 15A was going to fall out in the new world so . . . update on 20R- so some people will be in the know.

Per conversations with Carrie Chaffin, I have learned that all construction interest has been moved off of 20R and onto 15A. 

 I have received detail of 20R's interest income acct (SAP# 62000000).  The detail confirms that this activity is no longer on 20R.

On 20R's 2000 return, we reversed the construction interest income.  And- we had to reduce the depreciation taken on these assets for tax.  We did this by depreciating the construction interest amount as a negative depreciation.  This was done to reduce the tax basis being depreciated by the construction interest not recognized for tax.

I am assuming that  we will reverse the construction interest income on 15A since that is where it is being recorded.  Celeste- you might want to see if you can find this on your SAP ledger for next close- or leave a note to whoever is taking over 15A.

My questions is how are we going to handle the depreciation issue.  Because- isn't it our understanding that the basis is still on 20R?

Also- since we reversed the interest income on 20R in 2000 as a temporary item- I guess we are going to have to transfer the tax balance associated with the M-1 to 15A at some point??  So- that it can be tracked to turn.  At what point it is appropriate to do that?

Thanks-
Shanna

"Co. 1650 CFIT Expense","Todd,

Please look into the above.  This company has a $5.4mm current federal tax expense that has never been booked to the G/L.  I think it has something to do w/ the fact that the entity maintenance screen shows UNK for type of entity & domestic/foreign.  This is a Domestic Division of 364.  You will probably have to coordinate w/ Kathy to ensure the YTD figure for CFIT gets booked.

Please make sure this gets corrected for next month.

Subject:	Raptor unwind tax accounting

Essie:

The purpose of this message is to communicate to you, for co-ordination with the appropriate ""MARC"" personnel, the relevant facts of the transactions that closed on Friday, September 28, to unwind the Raptor structures.  As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.

Each of the ""top tier"" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) ""purchased"" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the ""bottom tier"" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively).  Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000.  As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures).  

For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine).  The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument.  Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity.  For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil.  

We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books.  Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message.  

Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10.  Thanks!

Do we have a summary of the accounting entries made to report the sale?

For tax close this Wednesday, we'll have to reverse the book realized gain on company 33R and calculate taxes on the tax gain.  Please provide a schedule identifying the total proceeds and SAP entries used to reverse the MTM and report the realized book gain.

Credit to 4500000	Other Commodity - Third Party	$138,475,829.50

My question is was the sale reclassed to 30R by the following entry:
33Q	Debit to 450160000	Financial Settlements - Intercompany 	$151,404,038.50
	Credit to 20023000	Accts Rec/Payable Non Trade - Interco	$151,404,038.50

33R	Debit to 20023000	Accts Rec/Payable Non Trade - Interco	$151,404,038.50
	Credit to 450160000	Financial Settlements - Intercompany	$151,404,038.50

If so what else makes up the $151,404,038.50?

My next question is what is the cost of  the inventory that went to cost of sales for the sale of $138,475,829.50 S02 credits?  What was the entry that recorded the amount into cost of sales?

If you could get back to me as soon as possible, I would greatly appreciate it.

John,
I made the entries in TIS.  The following taxes will be booked on IVEST2C, IVEST4C, and ENRON1C.  We have to book taxes to all three paths in Hyperion.  CPOTH4C did not have a Path 2 company set up in TIS so we switched to the IVEST companies.  The companies have been approved in TIS and should post back to Hyperion with the next load (currently scheduled for Monday).

1825 - NC DFIT Exp	236,107,668
0750 - NC DFIT Liab		(236,107,668)

I will be out of the office on Monday & Tuesday.  Please call Robbie Lewis or Michelle Sharp if you need anything while I am out.

Subject:	RE: Tax related questions on 20R

Carrie-

As you know- I took over the tax work of this entity in June.  I am still trying to work out some details on this company and make sure I have a complete understanding of the G/L- in order to be better equipped to make tax decisions.

1.   From looking at last year's tax return, it looks like there is some difference between how book and tax handles the the information being held in SAP account# 62000000 Interest Income- Third party.

Can you please provide some type of schedule for that account that is comparable to what was provided last year.  Last year the account was broken out into 3 parts:  interest income on assets owned by EES, interest income on assets not owned by EES, and interest on loans/notes. 

I would be happy to fax you a copy of what I am looking at- if it helps clear up any confusion.

I have attached a spreadsheet that details the current year activity in the interest income account.  Currently, the only interest income following through 20R is Interest on our Owens Corning Sale-Leaseback, Interest on the TRW Credit Reimbursement and Interest on Excelsior's Capital Project Reimbursement (essentially a loan).  There is no construction interest like there was last year - this is all recorded on Company 15A.


 

2.  I also have a note in the file saying that for the year 2000, books incorrectly booked the Quebecor $5 million promotional fee as a loan and calculated interest income on this loan.  Was this error corrected in the year 2001?  Or- should I see interest income from this $5 million Quebecor promotional fee in the breakout of the SAP account# 62000000 Interest Income- Third party?

This error was corrected in 2001.

3.  The next issue is book amortization.  Where is this being recorded on the income statement?-Is it still in 51009000?  There seems to have been confusion about if this was going to change.

This is still recorded in account 51009000 - other COS.  We had tried to move it to amortization expense, but Wade wanted it moved back above the line in COS.  This makes sense as really this amortization is a cost to the Deal.  Here's a schedule that details out the amortization activity for 2001:

 

	I have the following listed as companies that have separate amortization issues:

	Browns
	Giants
	Owens Corning
	Advanced Glass
	Owens Canada
	Extended Promo License (extension of Owens Corning)
	Quebecor
	Giants Equipment

	I already have received completed book amortization schedules for the first three from you (provided to Angie last year)- can you provide the amortization 	schedules for the rest?  	It is my understanding that on the last 5- no book amortization was recorded in 2000- and that the amount that should have been 	recorded in 2000 will be 	caught up along with the booking of the 2001 numbers.  Can you please verify that this is true and that the recording of the 2000 has 	occured?

	Also- could you please provide information for any other new deals that have occured in 2001 that books is calculating amortization for?

	I am open to any suggestions that would make this easier to track.

    

4.  The next major issue is deferred debits.  Can a get a detail of what makes up deferred debits as of 6/30/01?

Here's a breakout of deferred debits at 6/30/01.  One thing I know will change is the Owen's Canada Promotional Payment should actually be charged against the Owen's Corning deal.  This will be changed in July.

 

5.  Can I also have a detailed  breakdown of what is making up SAP acct# 45019000 Other Revenues Third Party?

While I was reviewing this account for 6/30/01, I found quite a few errors in the account, so I corrected these in July.  I think it would be easier for me to send you a schedule as of 7/31/01 with the breakdown of this account.  I am working on this schedule this week and will forward it to you by Friday.

Would it be possible to get all of this information by the end of the month?  Please call me if you want to discuss- or if it would be easier to just meet in person.

Thanks-
Shanna  





I found a few more accounts that I need detail for that explains the balances as of 6/30/01:

1.  25145100  Deferred Asset Development Cost - The eschedule should help you with this.  Basically this account was all of our ""deferred debit"" activity that was moved from the MSA system.  This month (August) we are actually going to move all construction costs to this account and leave all other ""deferred debit"" activity in 25149100.  See the above reconciliation - this details both accounts.
2.  33603000  Deferred Revenue/Gains - This is where we record Remedial/Replacement capital.  Currently we have replacement capital for Springs, Simon, & Tyco.  Let me know if you need further explanation on replacement capital.
3.  33605000  Deferred Credits- Other	(there is only one entry in this account and SAP says it was made by you)  This is a deferred Liability relating to the Pilkington contract.  We have agreed to pay them 1.5mm through credits on their next 12 invoices.  This was expensed in June and this liability was established.  The credits on the invoice will be debited against this liability.
4.  30700000  Current Liabilities- Other	The balance is in this account represents our cost accruals for June.
5.  45019000  Other Revenues- Third Party - See above

(If this is in e-schedule form- that is great.  Unfortunately, I currently don't have access to the folder on the J drive where EES posts the e-schedules.  I am trying to get access.)

I have attached the eschedule:

After thinking about our conversation this morning I don't think that we are on the same page.  I am looking for a sale of S02 credits that were sold by 33R but were held in inventory on 33Q.

Eloise Williams sent an e-mail to Jeff Herrold saying that an entry was made to the following accounts on 33Q:

"New Features in the Ad Hoc Database!","This message applies to all that use the ad hoc database and would like queries and reports to be easier to locate and use. 

We have added two enhancements to the Report Master in Ad Hoc this month.
1.	Sorting - The multicolumn reports can now sort by up to two attributes. For example, you can now group your companies in a business unit by reviewer then preparer. 
2.	Common Queries and Reports - Report Master now includes a new tab that includes common queries and reports that are run during the close process. This tool allows you to pull up a list of queries and reports that are relevant to the accrual or return process, and fill in the relevant criteria on the form. The list of queries and reports includes a description. 
New look - The new report master will now automatically be opened each time the ad hoc database is launched. 

To get these fantastic enhancements to your ad hoc database, just use the Ad Hoc Import Wizard to import The Whole Enchilada (TWE) by following the steps below:
    ?-------(Wizard)													(Enchiladas) -------? 
1.	Go to Forms and double click Ad Hoc Import Wizard 
2.	Scroll down and select the item called ""TWE"" 
3.	Select Import 
4.	Go to Forms and double click Report Master.
5.	Click on the tab, Common Queries and Reports and HAVE FUN!

If you have any questions or comments, please call Deborah Heath or Kelly McCain.

Subject:	RE: Sales Tax Payable accrual

Patty,  The $20 MM Sales Tax Accrual was originally recorded to 986, acct 30113000.  We transferred $5 MM in January 2001 for the PX Credit Reserve.  This month (Sept 2001) we moved $10 MM from this acct to the Bonus Accrual on 985.  I don't know the status of the remaining $4.5 MM left in the Taxes Payable -Other acct.

I think we have found the account - but it looks like this has been transferred to 985 from 986.  Can you provide us with the entries for both companies and let me know when you plan on taking this to the income statement - if you plan on doing this?

Thanks,

Patty

Todd,
Can you please provide Patty with the company and account number where the yearend sales tax accrual is recorded.  They are going to start making payments against the accrual.  Is the balance still at the original $15MM?

Subject:	EES revenues by city

I spoke with Sandra Tapia(TT) about the revenues by city request.  She asked that we provide them with a more timely request as part of the year-end request effort.  We need to ask them to gather the by city information for all EES states where by-city filing is a requirement.  This should be done in February after the year-end information has been finalized and they have filed their transaction tax reports for year-end.

This would impact all EES entities with physical gas and power sales - from memory these would include 985, 986, 20Q, 20R, 890 and 1J2.  The state include, but may not be limited to, Ohio, New York and Kentucky.

Please make sure that the person responsible for these entities includes this in their CB effort and this note in their year-end file.

Thanks,

Patty

Subject:	RE: July 2001 MTM analysis


Attached is the MTM analysis that we have done by company and in total.  (includes entites: 1572, 890, 20Q, 20R)

As you can see from the schedules, we can not match the change in the balance sheet to the income statement activity for 2 of the companies.

For company 890, the difference is ($20,000,000)- Tax knows what this difference is and understands it- so no explanation/research is needed.

For company 20R, the difference is $5,577,900- this is the difference that we in tax don't understand.

I prepared the majority of these spreadsheets, so if you can't follow our analysis- please feel free to call me. (ext. 35736)

Tax has Hyperion Close on Tuesday, Aug 14th.  We will contact you that morning to see if this amount should change our current tax entries.

Thanks-
Shanna

John,
I made the entries in TIS.  The following taxes will be booked on IVEST2C, IVEST4C, and ENRON1C.  We have to book taxes to all three paths in Hyperion.  CPOTH4C did not have a Path 2 company set up in TIS so we switched to the IVEST companies.  The companies have been approved in TIS and should post back to Hyperion with the next load (currently scheduled for Monday).

1825 - NC DFIT Exp	236,107,668
0750 - NC DFIT Liab		(236,107,668)

I will be out of the office on Monday & Tuesday.  Please call Robbie Lewis or Michelle Sharp if you need anything while I am out.
Thanks,
Michelle

Michelle:   As we discussed, would you please record the following tax entry in TIS:

						Dr.			Cr.			

	Other income							$710,594,336

	Interest expense			  $36,001,000	

	Non-current deferred debit		$674,593,336

The above entry is temporary and will reverse non-current deferred tax liability.   The principal intent of this entry is to reverse deferred tax on the book losses attributable to the unwinding of Project Raptor.   Thank you, John.
