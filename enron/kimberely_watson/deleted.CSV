"Weekly Report of 10/5/01","ETS State Government Report:

California

I00-11-002  Adequacy of SoCal System.  Since no parties challenged TW's testimony supporting SoCal's receipt point capacity proposal in Opening Comments, Transwestern did not file Reply Comments last week.  Most comments by intervenors focused on other issues such as their open season mechanism, curtailment, backbone transmission capacity addition planning, slack capacity and barriers to new interstate pipeline service.

A01-09-024  On Sept. 21, 2001, SoCalGas filed its Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding (BCAP) application.  The purpose of the filing is to revise rates to reflect the updated allocation among customers of non-gas commodity costs of service effective January 1, 2003.  In addition to the required rate revisions, SoCal requested authority to revise and simplify various tariffs and to implement several new programs.  Of interest is the proposal for allocation of firm receipt point capacity into their system.  Other  proposals address procedures for open seasons to expand the backbone system, an in-kind fuel charge for transportation and an expansion of the unbundled storage program including gas loaning services.  The application, testimony and exhibits have been distributed to Marketing, Legal and Regulatory for review.  Interventions will be due at the time of the pre-hearing conference which was proposed by SoCal to be held in late October.

Infrastructure Report.  The California Energy Commission approved its Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report on a 4-0 vote after several months of discussion and revisions to various drafts.  Most recently certain commenters encouraged the CEC to include an assessment of El Paso's impact on prices through market power and manipulation.  Instead the CEC report references the FERC proceedings addressing this issue and the fact that the CPUC which filed the complaint will represent the interests of California ratepayers.  Numerous factors are addressed as contributing toward the high prices experienced during the last heating season, these included insufficient receipt point takeaway capacity within California, insufficient capacity on the El Paso pipeline system, high demand for gas fired electric generation, low storage levels and extremely dry weather conditions which led to lower hydroelectric output.  Recommendations included encouraging additional in-state gas production, re-evaluate design criteria to expand intrastate systems, encourage the creation of new and independent storage facilities and revise curtailment rules.

New Mexico

01-121-PL  The rescheduled Sept 12th public meeting on the NMPRC's Safety NOI was held last week.  Rick Smith made the TW presentation.  Albino Zuniga, the lead NMPRC person did not attend.  Participation was low and uneventful.

Crude Oil Futures Fall

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX fell $0.79 
to $18.89 per barrel yesterday as the market continues to focus on 
bulging inventories, driven higher by a sharp drop in demand as a 
result of the absence of sustained cold weather in the Northeast. 
Traders are continuing to look for signs of an actual decrease in 
exports by OPEC and non-cartel producers. Many question how 
stringently OPEC and non-aligned producers will comply with new 
production curbs aimed at removing nearly 2.0 million bpd from the 
worlds supplies. Reports that Saudi Arabia is notifying customers of 
cuts in February volumes have led some to speculate that compliance 
was not all that great in January. Traders are also looking at 
Russian refined-product exports which, if increased, would offset its 
pledge to cut crude exports by 150,000 bpd. With the API report due 
out later today, it is also likely that some are just taking a wait 
and see stance. However, there are predictions that distillate demand 
will improve somewhat after 3 consecutive weeks of huge inventory 
increases. A drop in gasoline and heating oil futures also pressured 
the market downward. Heating oil futures for February delivery on the 
NYMEX slid $0.0228 to $0.5166 per gallon. February gasoline futures 
on the NYMEX lost $0.0226 to $0.5505 per gallon. In London, Brent 
crude oil futures for February delivery on the IPE were down $1.08 to 
$19.78 per barrel as they are set to expire on Wednesday. March Brent 
crude futures dropped $0.99 to 18.93 per barrel.

Conoco Attractive Prospect for Totalfina and Shell 


    The merger between Phillips and Conoco may face some stiff 
hurdles, namely TotalFina Elf and Royal Dutch/Shell. The two major 
European oil companies are both looking at the possibility of 
stealing Conoco from Phillips. Either company could appeal to 
Conoco's shareholders, some of whom are upset that they were not 
offered a takeover premium by Phillips. TotalFina Elf has long been 
looking to expand its presence in the North American market and was 
thought to be sizing up Conoco before the Phillips deal was 
announced. Shell has only made $6 billion worth of acquisitions over 
the past 3 years and finds itself with an abundance of cash that it 
needs to spend. Tax complications prevent it from repurchasing stock 
as other companies have done and due to the recent rash of mergers, 
there is a shortage of viable projects in which to invest. If Shell 
pursues less viable projects, returns on capital will suffer, but 
that will happen if it keeps storing up cash so a takeover of Conoco 
presents an attractive alternative for the company. However, 
Totalfina is seen as having a better chance than many of gaining US 
regulatory approval. Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco are 
constrained because of their already sizable presence in the US. One 
problem other bidders for Conoco could encounter is the hefty $550 
million breakup fee that Phillips and Conoco have written into their 
contract to discourage any attempts to kill the deal.

ExxonMobil to Supply Kuwait with Qatar Natural Gas 

    ExxonMobil has reached an agreement to supply Kuwait with natural 
gas from Qatar's giant North Field. The agreement between ExxonMobil, 
Kuwait Petroleum and Qatar Petroleum calls for production from the 
Enhanced Gas Utilization project in Qatar's North Field to be 
supplied to Kuwait. Capacity of the project is about 1.75 Bcf per 
day. Qatar has the world's 3rd-largest natural gas reserves and is 
seeking to increase exports to the Gulf region after investing 
billions of dollars for drilling. Kuwait needs to secure a steady 
natural gas supply to meet power generation needs.

Canadian Energy Companies' Profits Tumble

   Canada's energy companies will have the weakest quarterly results 
in 2 years, due to slumping oil and natural gas prices. The recession 
has meant sharp drops in both commodity prices in the 4th quarter as 
demand fell. Suncor has warned will be a drop in net earnings of as 
much as 75% from the 3rd quarter. Analysts are forecasting almost 
every energy company in 2002 to have lower earnings and cash flow 
than in 2001, and then positive increments again in 2003. Suncor 
warned of weaker results on Friday, with numbers showing net income 
would fall into the C$18 million to C$22 million range, down from 
C$73 million in the 3rd quarter and C$111 million a year earlier. 
Besides the lower prices, Suncor had higher than expected costs for 
starting up the C$3.4 billion expansion of its northern Alberta oil 
sands operation, and squeezed profit margins in its refining segment, 
a situation expected to hit all the integrated companies. The impact 
of weaker prices has already caused drilling activity to fall below 
last year's record levels and recent predictions that overall 
spending in 2002 will 25% below 2001 levels.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"GPCM News: 1/28/02: Philips Seeks Tax Help on ANGTS: AEC,PanCanadian Consider Merger","From http://www.enerfaxgold.com <http://www.enerfaxgold.com/> :

 

Phillips Seeks Tax Help on Alaska Pipeline Project

 

    Phillips Petroleum says it is optimistic about a proposed 

pipeline that would transport natural gas from the North Slope to 

Alberta on a route following the existing trans-Alaska oil pipeline 

and the Alaska Highway. The pipeline was authorized in the 1970s by 

the US and Canadian governments, but poor economics precluded 

commercialization. All three major Alaska oil producers, Phillips, BP 

and Exxon Mobil, believe that new legislation is needed to update the 

Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System Act, which granted the 

initial permits for the project. The producers have also agreed to 

seek permission for accelerated depreciation on federal taxes. 

However, Phillips also wants a credit that would be applied if 

natural gas prices reach a designated floor such as $1.25 per MMBtu. 

The three major North Slope oil producers have spent about $100 

million to study the feasibility of building an overland pipeline 

that would tie the North Slope to existing facilities in Alberta. The 

pipeline project would run about 2000 miles would cost $15 billion - 

$20 billion. 

 

Alberta Energy and PanCanadian Consider Merger

  

    PanCanadian Energy Will buy Alberta Energy in a $16.8 billion 

share exchange deal which will create North America's largest oil 

exploration and production company, replacing Anadarko. The deal will 

allow the companies to compete effectively on a global basis. The new 

company, which is to be headquartered in Calgary, will be named 

EnCana Corp. The exchange ratio is a market-to-market ratio based on 

the average of the closing price for the 10 trading days ended 

January 23rd. PanCanadian shareholders will own about 54% and AEC 

shareholders will own about 46% of EnCana. Combined, the stocks of 

the two companies make up 44% of the TSE's oil and gas sub-index. 

Some say that Canadian companies have realized the need to bulk up in 

order to be competitive with larger companies in the US, like 

Anadarko, Burlington Resources and Devon Energy, and to attract 

investors. The deal could also be a self-protection measure in 

response to last year's rash of takeovers of Canadian oil firms by US 

companies, like those that took over Gulf Canada, Anderson 

Exploration and Canadian Hunter. Alberta Energy and PanCanadian may 

have seen themselves as vulnerable to possible takeovers. PanCanadian 

had been considered a possible takeover target when it was spun off 

from Canadian Pacific in October. A new AEC-PanCanadian company would 

produce 255,000 bpd of oil and natural gas liquids and 2.5 Bcf of 

natural gas per day. PanCanadian has natural gas and oil production 

facilities in Western Canada and offshore operations in Nova Scotia, 

the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, where it recently discovered the 

areas largest oil field in 10 years, named Buzzard. AEC also produces 

oil and natural gas in Western Canada, owns about 14% of the Syncrude 

Canada oil sands project and has exploration, production, pipeline 

and natural gas storage units in the Rocky Mountains, Ecuador and the 

Arctic.

"FBI: Bin Laden may target Energy Industry","WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 -  ""The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death"", news sources said Monday.   

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.

""We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have
approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,"" said
the memo, adding that the information was ""from a source of undetermined
reliability."" 

The FBI warning continued that ""such an attack would allegedly take place in
the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either
captured or killed.""

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.

Natural Gas Futures Dip But Hold Above $2


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX dipped 
briefly below $2 per MMBtu Friday, but bounced back on short-covering 
and funds rolling to end the day down $0.011 at $2.037 per MMBtu. The 
March contract gained $0.014 to $2.104 per MMBtu. The market began 
the session lower and gradually works its way higher most of the day, 
holding inside only a $0.05 range. Funds continued rolling positions 
into March and April contracts and beyond, and marketers braced 
themselves for February's expiration tomorrow. Although the market is 
making an effort to stay above $2.00, it made a lower high, a lower 
low and closed lower for the day and the week. So look for the market 
to continue down this week unless colder weather is forecast. Also 
expect to see an even smaller withdrawal this week from storage of 
about 110 ? 120 Bcf. However, there is a chance for limited short-
covering into expiration as the market continues to be oversold 
technically. On Friday, estimated volume was about 90,000 contracts, 
with about 40,000 of those spreads or hedge trades. Natural gas for 
weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.05 ? $0.15 
lower Friday, Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub 
dropped $0.09 to $2.03 per MMBtu.

S&P Changes Ratings Process 


    Standard & Poor's is changing the way it rates companies, in part 
because of problems from the demise of Enron. S&P is likely to 
conduct more formal reviews of ratings, and will be more specific 
about how far a rating may fall in the event of a review for 
downgrade. It will also focus more on credit cliff situations, which 
could result in a precipitous decline in a company's ratings if 
certain events take place. It will require companies to publicize 
rating triggers, such as one that in November could have forced Enron 
to pay off a $690 million note because of a recent downgrade. S&P is 
considering how best to incorporate securities price movements into 
ratings. S&P rates companies on a sliding scale from `AAA' to `D'. 
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch are also considering changes to 
make their own rating activity more timely.

Exelon Reduces Net Income on Accounting Error

  Exelon 3rd quarter net income was 6.7% lower than reported in 
October because of an accounting error. Net income was $376 million, 
or $1.16 per share, not $403 million, or $1.25 per share. That means 
Exelon's 3rd quarter profit rose 62% from $232 million, or $1.35 per 
share, a year earlier. The company had a bigger than expected loss in 
a trust fund that has money for dismantling nuclear generators after 
they are closed. The fund is not managed by Exelon. Exelon will 
report 4th quarter and 2001 financial results tomorrow. It probably 
earned about $4.30 - $4.45 last year.

Former Enron Vice Chairman Apparently Commits Suicide


    Former Enron Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter, who had opposed 
the accounting practices that led to the downfall of the energy 
trading giant, apparently took his own life early Friday morning. 
Police said that Baxter was dead at the scene and the only occupant 
of the car. A suicide note and a revolver were found at the scene. 
Baxter was chairman and CEO of Enron North America before being named 
chief strategy officer. In October of 2000, he was promoted to vice 
chairman. Baxter resigned last May after ten years with Enron, during 
which time he helped build its wholesale energy business. Baxter had 
disagreed with then CEO Jeffrey Skilling over the inappropriateness 
of off-balance-sheet transactions involving partnerships that 
ultimately brought the company down. Baxter was one of the Enron 
directors targeted in about 40 investor lawsuits which allege that 
the company concealed losses by the use of the partnerships. Baxter 
engineered the $3.21 billion purchase of Portland General Electric in 
1997. Enron has agreed to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas 
for $2.98 billion in cash, stock and debt. Baxter resigned after 
losing a battle with Skilling for control of the direction the 
company would take. He favored the acquisition of energy producing 
assets to build the company, while Skilling preferred to expand the 
commodities trading unit, in Enron's asset light theory. Baxter 
reportedly told friends that he planned to earn a Ph.D. in history, 
spend time with his family and look for a position as chief executive 
at another company.

Dabhol Sale Process Begins This Week

  
    The bidding process for Enron's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power project 
in India is set to begin this week. The Industrial Development Bank 
of India said advertisements will be placed in newspapers. Interested 
foreign companies are Royal Dutch/Shell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de 
France. Potential Indian buyers are BSES Ltd, Tata Power and Gas 
Authority of India. Reportedly Rothschild, DSP Merrill Lynch and 
Smifs Securities have been appointed to search for bidders. The vast 
2,184 MW natural gas fired power plant and nearby LNG facility, the 
largest foreign private investment ever in India, has been idle since 
Enron pulled out last June in a dispute over the cost of the power 
provided to its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board. The 740 MW first phase of Dabhol began operating in May 1999. 
A 1,444 MW 2nd phase was almost complete when construction was halted 
after the state electricity board fell $240 million behind in 
payments for power provided. Those interested in acquiring the plant 
must put up a non-refundable $100,000 in earnest money. The sellers 
intend to sell the plant as a whole, but bidders may bid jointly for 
the operation and split it up later. A London data room will be 
established for the commercial and financial agreements, operating 
and historical data, projections and information on the status of 
Phase II. Due diligence is expected to begin early next month, with a 
possible deadline of the middle of March for submitting offers. The 
US government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a lender and 
guarantor of  loans to the project, and IDBI have led the talks among 
the parties involved, including 5 Indian financial institutions, 20 
foreign banks, 3 foreign government lending agencies, several 
governments, equity holders and potential bidders. Enron owns 65% of 
the Dabhol project, GE and Bechtel each own 10% and the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board 15%.

California PUC Rejects Sempra Settlement

    The California PUC has rejected a settlement proposed by Sempra 
Energy that seeks to split profits from power sales between customers 
of San Diego Gas and Electric and shareholders. The decision will 
likely lead to a lawsuit between Sempra and the PUC. At stake is $363 
million the PUC argues could be used to the benefit of customers by 
paying down a special balancing account set up during the 
California's energy crisis last year that captured the difference 
between retail prices state regulators allowed SDG&E to charge and 
soaring wholesale power prices. To cash in on the high prices, SDG&E 
sold all the electricity remaining on several 5-year power contracts 
it had signed in 1996 and 1997, pocketing the profit..

Alberta Energy and PanCanadian Consider Merger

  
    PanCanadian Energy Will buy Alberta Energy in a $16.8 billion 
share exchange deal which will create North America's largest oil 
exploration and production company, replacing Anadarko. The deal will 
allow the companies to compete effectively on a global basis. The new 
company, which is to be headquartered in Calgary, will be named 
EnCana Corp. The exchange ratio is a market-to-market ratio based on 
the average of the closing price for the 10 trading days ended 
January 23rd. PanCanadian shareholders will own about 54% and AEC 
shareholders will own about 46% of EnCana. Combined, the stocks of 
the two companies make up 44% of the TSE's oil and gas sub-index. 
Some say that Canadian companies have realized the need to bulk up in 
order to be competitive with larger companies in the US, like 
Anadarko, Burlington Resources and Devon Energy, and to attract 
investors. The deal could also be a self-protection measure in 
response to last year's rash of takeovers of Canadian oil firms by US 
companies, like those that took over Gulf Canada, Anderson 
Exploration and Canadian Hunter. Alberta Energy and PanCanadian may 
have seen themselves as vulnerable to possible takeovers. PanCanadian 
had been considered a possible takeover target when it was spun off 
from Canadian Pacific in October. A new AEC-PanCanadian company would 
produce 255,000 bpd of oil and natural gas liquids and 2.5 Bcf of 
natural gas per day. PanCanadian has natural gas and oil production 
facilities in Western Canada and offshore operations in Nova Scotia, 
the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, where it recently discovered the 
areas largest oil field in 10 years, named Buzzard. AEC also produces 
oil and natural gas in Western Canada, owns about 14% of the Syncrude 
Canada oil sands project and has exploration, production, pipeline 
and natural gas storage units in the Rocky Mountains, Ecuador and the 
Arctic.

I don't think that decision has been made.  I think we should be allocating.  This should be discussed today at

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Kids and I went out Saturday for first flight in +10 years only to have to
abort due to mid time student landing in front of us flipping a new 172
over.  I did not see the flip, but it looks like he ran off the runway and
the nose wheel caught in the ditch and he went over.  No one was hurt, but
the plane is probably a write off.

We made it on Sunday.  Normal stalls, steep turns, touch and goes.  I
probably have 1 or 2 more rides to make sure it wasn't a fluke, but we
should soon be able to go for the famous $100 hamburger or $200 burger if we
get it at Dennis's.

Also training the kids about planes.  We started with, don't touch unless I
say okay and don't walk around props.  We made a choice of not giving them
headphones so we could have quiet on the intercom, but we forgot to tell
Power not to talk on final unless there was a collision pending.  He also
commented we forgot to tell him about the stalls but Marydith like them.  I
curious how much of his PC flying will translate to the real thing when he
can ride copilot.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

       Summary of October 21, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks ?

   This week's gathering focused on how, in light of our present
circumstances, can we learn to practice a true present and enjoy the
good that is all around us?

   We must develop
   Wisdom about the way life works,
   Skill in making life work for us, and
   Faith that will sustain us in all times.

   The blackest, bleakest day in Christian history was essential for
the brightest.

   Noticing and Enjoying Strawberries

   In the e-mail preview of our time together today I told the
following story. It is a very famous story from the Buddhist tradition:

   The story is of a monk who was fleeing a tiger. He ran to the edge
of a cliff and, being unable to stop himself, went over the edge. On
the way down he caught the branch of a tree. He had been saved. He
looked down and, way below on the ground, was another tiger. He must
hang on with all his might. No way to go back up and certain death
below. As he was hanging there, he glanced aside and saw a strawberry
on a bush growing from the edge of the cliff beside him. He let go of
the limb with one hand, picked the strawberry and savored it.

   This story, of course, is a parable. It is told to illustrate the
importance of developing the ability to enjoy a true present.

   Our present circumstances are certainly chaotic are they not? How
are we to develop the ability to enjoy the delicious strawberry that is
just within reach? Indeed, how can we develop the ability even to
notice that the strawberry is there? That's what our time together is
going to be about today - developing the ability to notice and enjoy
strawberries even when things fall apart.

   Let me begin with some preliminary observations just to make sure we
are all on the same page.

   In the last fourteen years, I have given almost 700 different talks.
That's a lot. Does anyone have that much to say?

   The answer to that is, ""No!"" Twenty years or so ago, working with my
teacher/mentor Carlyle Marney, I came up with something of a creed. I
could put the entire Christian faith in less than fifty words. Here
they are:

   God is in our history with a searching love.
   Jesus Christ is central.
   The cross is unavoidable.
   Church is a community of believers and there is no salvation by
one's self. That is to say, faith is relational.
   Discipline is required.
   We can live an assured hope. That is to say, there is a saving
possibility in every situation.

   That, from a Christian perspective, is what we have to talk about.
What changes is
   our understanding of it,
   our circumstances and
   us.

   One of the things that has changed, of course, is that on 9/11 we
began to be forced to notice what is going on around us. Mostly,
however, we have seen just tigers chasing us and a huge abyss below us
with more tigers. You don't hear much talk about delicious
strawberries. Indeed, we are frantically looking for the branch to hold
on to. I hope that you get at least that much here.

   I was working out at my athletic club on Wednesday and was
struggling away reading about Methodist Polity while doing the stair-
master. On a recumbent bike in front of me was a man - I admire him for
his spunk; 82 and still working out daily - who was pontificating about
how to deal with our nation's current crisis. He went on and on about
how ""the only way to fight terrorism is with terrorism.""

   Like you, I have seen the newspapers, magazines and listened to the
programs on radio and television. I found it funny as all get-out that
on one of the television news magazine programs this past week they
were talking about how we were becoming a nation of terrorized people.
Hello! They are the ones who are stirring up the fear. ""What should you
have in your survival kit? Stay tuned for the news that follows."" Give
me a break.

   Yet the fact is that our government officials are saying more
terrorist attacks are likely to take place in this country. How do we
live with that?

   I do not want to ignore or deny the tigers chasing us or the abyss.
I do want what my teaching is about to help us notice and enjoy the
strawberries.

   This circumstance that we find ourselves in can be the perfect
teaching moment for us.

   We don't like this because we have come in our culture to value
comfort so much. But the feelings of loss and fear that we have
experienced since 9/11 can show us, with terrifying clarity, exactly
what our spiritual work needs to be.

   Not only has an emphasis on comfort seduced us away from reality but
also so has the need for each of us to appear to the other that we've
got it all together.

   Let me be very clear: spiritual practice isn't about being good; it
is about waking up.

   One day Gabriel was walking about in the heavenly realm. He came
upon God and it was apparent that God was very depressed. Gabriel said
to God, ""What's the matter?"" God said, pointing to the earth, ""Look at
what a mess they have made of everything. Nothing is going like I had
hoped it would. I'm going to destroy the lot of them.""
   ""But you can't do that,"" Gabriel said.
   ""And why not? I'm God, the Almighty. I can do whatever I wish.""
   ""Because,"" said Gabriel, ""you promised.""
   ""I did?""
   ""Yes. At the time of the great flood.""
   ""Well, then, I'm going to get rid of most of them. Send someone to
go over all the earth and find the truly righteous. Give to each of the
righteous a small brass plaque so that when I send the angel of death
to destroy, the angel of death will be able to distinguish the
righteous from those who are not.""
   So Gabriel did as he was instructed. And, do you know what the brass
plaque said? No? You didn't get one either?

   Our eyes have been opened by the events of 9/11 and following. We
hate it. We want to run.

   In the past we have run. We have used all sorts of things to escape
the way life is.

   One of the things we've used is humor. I don't think I heard one
single joke about the Oklahoma City bombing, did you? I'm beginning to
hear some about aspects of our current crisis.

   Conan O'Brien said, ""It was reported today that Osama Bin Laden has
50 brothers and sisters. Which absolutely shocked me because I had no
idea he was Catholic""

   Jay Leno said this: ""You read about all these terrorists, most of
them came here legally, but they hung around on these expired visas,
some for as long as 10-15 years. Now, compare that to Blockbuster; you
are two days late with a video and these people are all over you. Let's
put Blockbuster in charge of immigration.""

   Here are some more Leno lines:

   ""The U.S. Government has said they are now going to go after the
terrorist's electronic banking system. You know what they should do?
They should transfer Bin Laden's funds to my bank. They'd mess up his
deposits, screw up his statement and nickel and dime him to death with
service charges.""

   ""More and more facts coming out about Osama bin Laden. You know, he
never sleeps in the same place two nights in a row, just like Clinton.""

   We have other ways of protecting ourselves from ""what is."" Each and
every one of us has wanted to be able - and this is the first principle
of Ordinary Life - to be an exception to the way life is. We have
wanted to get a leg up on life and in the process we only cause
ourselves more suffering. So we protect ourselves from the pain by all
sorts of addictions. We work furiously to get those things we have been
taught will make us happy - when we finally have them. We are committed
to happy endings and trying to make them become realities robs us of
the very life we say we want.

   If we can't manipulate the situation, what can we do?

   Three things:
   we must develop wisdom about the way life is,
   skill in making life work for us, and
   a faith that can sustain us at all times, especially during the
times when there seems to be no rational reason to believe at all.

   To do any of this takes creative imagination, the ability to see
things out of our usual way of seeing them. I will stoop to almost any
means whatever to get you to think ""outside the box"" in spiritual
terms.

   If we are going to experience and participate in the abundant life,
- if we are going to notice and appreciate the strawberries - we have
to use our minds. And our spirits.

   Last Sunday in our dialogue time together I reminded you that the
central facet of the Christian faith if a belief in the resurrection.
There are, as you might imagine, many different views and
interpretations of the resurrection from very conservative folks who
believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus to those very liberal
Christian who see it as a metaphor of a new life that is possible in
the now moment, made available by faith. Some folks get caught up in
fights about which of these positions is correct. I'm not interested in
that. I want to offer you and me insights and methods that will assist
us in living as fully and freely and bravely and beautifully as we
possibly can.

   One of the teachings we can get out of 9/11 is that none of us knows
how much longer we have to live. We have hopes and assumptions but not
real knowledge. What do you want to do with that time you have left?

   What I want to do with that period of time is create life-enhancing
events and experiences for myself and you. That isn't the only thing I
want to do but it is the main thing. With that in mind let's take a
step in that direction.

   In order for there to be a resurrection in Christian theology, there
first had to be - crucifixion. The crucifixion was the early church's
version of September 11. Now, I know this is a very imperfect analogy.
But bear with me a moment.

   The crucifixion of Jesus took place on a day that soon began to be
called ""Good Friday."" Why call it good? I know, ""good Friday"" is a
corruption of ""God's Friday.""  But the phrase ""good Friday"" has stuck
for a reason.  After all, it would be just as easy to say ""God's
Friday.""  Why is it called good? What could be good about it?  What
could be good about it for us? Because when you look at it, it seems to
most assuredly a holy mess.

   One of Jesus' disciples deals with his disappointment and
frustration by betraying his teacher. He careens out of control,
eventually committing suicide.

   The politicians of the day dealt with the events of the day in a way
that foreshadows quandaries that we see in things like the some of the
decisions in the Middle East we are paying such a price for now. They
arrest Jesus, then attempt to release him, then hear his case, then
consider the religious opposition to him.

   The religious community fares no better as they function in a
dither. They orchestrate a way to honor the letter of their law but
slaughter the spirit of it. Then they completely lose control as the
man they most want to abolish is labeled their king.

   The climate is emotionally explosive. Nerves are set on edge. Peter
takes it out on an innocent bystander by cutting his ear off.

   Pilate has second thoughts but is afraid to trust his better
judgment when he sees how vicious the crowd has become. And the crowd
is unruly, uneasy, in that volatile state that precedes bedlam.

   The evening news reports that nature itself is out of kilter, torn
by violent storms; darkness comes at mid-day.

   There is confusion and chaos about this so-called Good Friday.

   We have trouble with confusion and chaos. We are creatures of order.
Control is most important to us. Our ideal person is one who has it all
together, as we put it: one who has everything under control. To lose
control, in our view of things, is a form of sickness. One of the
things we hope and pray for is that as we get older we won't lose
control of our bodies or fall victim to some disease where we lose
control. We would rather die. Certainly we don't want anyone else
controlling us either sick or well.

   Good Friday is chaotic. The day is nonsensical. But maybe, just
maybe that is precisely what the day is about - a kind of confusion and
chaos that our minds, to say nothing about our hearts, can't organize.

   Chaos comes and we are in panic. Our need to make sense out of it
goes into overdrive. When we ourselves lose control and go outside our
values, and we do, the complex mixture of pain and shame is
overwhelming.

   A few years ago as I was leaving the house to go to work, the phone
rang with the news that during the night a drug crazed kid had,
apparently at random selection, broken into the home of two friends of
ours and bludgeoned them to death while they slept. Just two weekends
before they had gone on a retreat with this Sunday School class. The
event made me crazy trying to make sense of it. You just never know who
or when or where things might suddenly stop happening.

   Jesus is brutally murdered by truly good people just doing their
jobs. And we look at that and it makes no sense to us. We want to
organize it and explain it with some political or psychological or
theological premise. We always end up exasperated.

   One of the problems with the story of the crucifixion of Jesus is
that we who do so love to be in control are comforted because we
already know the end of this story.

   Yet I will assert that we who do so love to be in control really do
not know what to do with this day.

   It is for that very reason that we call this day good. It is good in
the sense that it is good for us. It is good for us to be made to stare
into this mess which is so far beyond our control. It is good for us
because it reminds us of what happens when our design runs amuck. It is
good for us because it reminds us that we are not in absolute control
even when we think we are. It is good for us also because it reminds us
of our origins and our ends.

   Now pay attention: There is theological construction under way here.
Put on your hard hats and thinking caps.

   The only other place in the scriptural tradition that invites us to
contemplate such a formless, chaotic, and unfathomably dark mystery is
the Genesis story which tells us that in the beginning ""the earth was
without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep."" We
are reminded that we are children of chaos, born of its confusion and
fashioned out of its corruptible elements, called by the spirit of God
from the tumult and shaped by God into whatever order we shall ever
know. The great discomfort of Good Friday then is not the pain we
inflicted upon Jesus, not even the sorrow of his death but the reality
of the chaos it reveals. It is, most assuredly a holy mess. But notice
that our tradition sees within Jesus what they called the ""new Adam.""
If Jesus be the new Adam, then Good Friday, so filled with chaos is
also the first day of the new creation. The crucifixion and the turmoil
and the confusion surrounding it constitute the raw mass of chaos from
which a new order is made. And the humble, humiliating lesson that
awaits us is that this new order, like the chaos, is beyond our
control. Admitting this has never been easy, especially in our culture,
and especially for those whose lives are built upon making sense out of
things and staying in control.

   So I invite you to take your place in the midst of the chaos, to pay
homage to the nonsense. If we could just let go of those instinctive
inclinations to probe the chaos or grasp it, we might find ourselves in
all of it. And if we could go through life and come before God in this
manner, we might know the wisdom that would set us free. We might
actually be strengthened to face, in humility, the overwhelming chaos
and the numbing nonsense of our own time.

   I heard someone say the other day, and this is so typical of us when
things don't go to our liking, ""I don't see how a God of love and
justice could allow the events of September 11 to happen. I can't
believe in God anymore.""

   Folks, it is not God who is put to the test here any more than God
was put to a test on Good Friday. It is we ourselves who are put to the
test. And when we have seen this truth and made it ours, when we have
given up our vain attempts to undo history, to guarantee the present,
or to predetermine the future, we might see more clearly that we are
the creatures and God is the creator.

   Maybe that would make each day a new creation for us. Maybe we could
even be quiet enough to hear what God says after every act of creation,
creation out of the chaos, ""It is good.""

   So there it hangs: a beautiful delicious strawberry. Got the faith
to reach out and taste it? God, let's pray that we do.

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

"Coal Prices","Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the 
Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB

Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001

Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices

Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your
pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power
producers-may have been lulled to sleep.

Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major
players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. 

While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major
producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market
because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a
hold on their fuel costs. 

However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his
hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract
coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. 

And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for
low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are
raring to get what they believe they deserve. 

One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the
country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy
usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal
stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

Summary of November 25, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks ?

   It's going to be difficult to give a summary of our gathering for
this past Sunday. Several people got up and gave their reasons/
reactions to Thanksgiving. I've included below some of the remarks I
made and what I had available of what others contributed to the
occasion. It was, to me, a wonderful gathering. Enjoy!

Much love,

Bill Kerley

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

          Thanksgiving 2001

   This past week contained our national holiday, Thanksgiving. As I
see it, you and I have so much for which to be grateful.

   That we are here able to participate in and benefit from this
gathering is so profound a blessing.

   Last week I wasn't here. I was visiting with my father and brother
in Tennessee. It was almost the first time I've gotten to fly since my
eye challenge. So, I hadn't seen my Dad since shortly after my mother's
death in January.

   I am grateful to and for my parents. I'm grateful not only for their
long lives but for the many gifts I have received from them. As I
visited with my father and brother I was aware of such a rich history.
I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful for growth itself. I noticed, for
example, that I was relieved to notice that I have gotten over my
sibling rivalry issues. Of course, my fancy-pants-Mr.-Big-Shot-retired-
vice-president-of-a-big-corporation hasn't.

   I'm grateful for life itself.

   I heard a story recently about a man who was in the hospital. His
wife was with him when the doctor came in to visit the man. The man was
suffering from some mysterious malady. After a few minutes examining
the patient, the doctor called the wife out into the hall. He said to
her, ""I've done all I can do for your husband. I'm going to dismiss
him. Your husband is suffering from a very serious disease, combined
with horrible stress. If you don't do the following, your husband can
die: Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant and make
sure he is in a good mood. For lunch, fix him a nutritious meal. For
dinner, prepare an especially nice meal for him. Don't burden him with
chores. Don't discuss your stress; this will probably make him feel
worse. And most importantly, you must be intimate with your husband
every day of the week. If you can do this for at least ten months to a
year, I think your husband will regain his health completely.""
   On the way home, the husband asked his wife, ""When the doctor called
you out into the hall, what did he say to you?""
   She reached over and patted him on the leg and said, ""He said that
you're going to die.""

   I am also grateful to and for you.

   I issued some invitations for folks to come and share their reasons
for being grateful. I don't know who might respond but if you are here
and want to do that, now is the time.

   At this point the following people spoke to the Ordinary Life
gathering:

   Marti Nelson spoke about her experience at the 10-Day - The Retreat
of Noble Silence. She said that it was one of the most difficult and
important things she has ever done for herself. Even more difficult
than the chemotherapy she has been through the past year for cancer.
But so valuable! She encouraged everyone to do it.

   Then Ron Marr came with some words he had prepared for the occasion
I'm going to share some of them here:

     The Truth About Thanksgiving

   Some years ago Bill observed, ""If the work of art you are creating
is your life, you don't want the canvas to be too small."" My
thanksgiving story is a life in process, and thankfully, its fabric
keeps expanding.
   I once led a class on the subject ""Truth Telling."" In preparing, I
gathered numerous quotes collected over the years; some humorous; some
wise. Attempting somehow to reconcile the many themes running wild
through the pages, I observed that ""all Christian truth is relational.""
Some cosmologists and quantum physicists would argue that at some
level, the same is true for the physical universe.
   In one way or another, all significant venues of my existence
involve some aspect of my relationship with God, my relationship with
myself, my relationship with my fellow human beings, and/or my
relationship with the planet and all other living things.
   It's in these realms I experience my deepest sadness, and my
greatest joys. In each I encounter the inescapable drama of separation
and reconciliation, and gratefully, the alchemy of grace.
   In the days following 9/11 my soul ached, and I felt a great
sadness. Not only for the obvious tragedy, but also for the remnants of
fear, anger, judgment, and separation that persist, to some extent, in
our own hearts and communities. We have difficulty fully loving and
accepting our selves to the point where we can receive effortlessly,
and without resistance or manipulation, the love constantly being
extended to us.
   Even within our churches we have yet to fully embrace those of
differing race, sexual orientation, and faith traditions. One writer
following 9/11 characterized the ""real war"" as between those who
worship a god of anger & judgment, and those who worship a God of Love.
   And, I am grateful for -
   a wave moving silently through the land - the re-valuing of living
authentically;
   the honest sharing of fears ? and dreams ? being expressed in so
many gatherings, following 9/11;
   for peoples everywhere, in every arena, now holding hands with those
who were invisible (or worse) only a brief time earlier.
   An intimate connection seems to exist between the quest for honesty
and a transparent personality.
   Since my divorce many years ago, Thanksgiving and Christmas have too
often found me mired in sadness, longing for my kids. Too often
reliving the pain of so many losses not fully grieved. Especially the
loss of deep intimacy, and family with which I crave so deeply to feel
a belonging.
   This week I had the privilege of delivering to my father the gift he
had selected from his nursing home bed, for my stepmother's birthday. I
also brought a couple of cards that sounded very much like him. Signing
one of the cards took almost fifteen minutes and I feared his note
would be illegible. Looking closer, I could read the tiny, shaking
letters ? and the four words, ""All my love - - Dick.""  And I knew the
powerful connection of family, and felt sheer joy at having been, in
some small way, a conduit for my best friend's love.

   If you are interested in the full text of Ron's remarks, e-mail him
at

   rmarr@netropolis.net

   At this point I remarked about how wonderful people are. So creative
and inventive. There are so many different ways to look at things. Each
of us sees things differently.

   Aren't you grateful for the human mind itself? And for having a
sound mind?

   Jim and Mary were both patients in a Mental Hospital. One day while
they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly jumped
into the deep end. He sunk to the bottom & stayed there. Mary promptly
jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled Jim out. When
the medical director became aware of Mary's heroic act he immediately
ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as he now considered
her to be mentally stable.
   When he went to tell Mary the news he said, ""Mary, I have good news
& bad news.  The good news is you're being discharged because since you
were able to jump in and save the life of another patient, I think
you've regained your senses. The bad news is, Jim, the patient you
saved, hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom. I am so
sorry, but he's dead.""
   Mary replied, ""He didn't hang himself, I put him there to dry.""

   To prove how creative people are Stephanie Warfield, Chaplain at St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital came and read excerpts from her most recent
""Chaplain's Journal."" This included reading a list of 100 things for
which she was grateful. As she read the list, I read the faces of those
who were present. What she said seemed to spark memories of things that
perhaps we'd otherwise have forgotten about.

   Bob Stecker came and reminded us about the importance of humor in
life with a story from his days as a drama director.

   Jean Snyder told of her gratitude for all the help and support she
felt while she and Marti went through a year of Marti's cancer
treatment and recovery.

   Casey Kelly came to give one brief line. It was this:

   ""Life is a comedy; tragedy is the long moment before we get the
joke.""

   I reflect back on the themes we strike in here over and over. They
are:

   There is no enlightenment out there. This is it.
   What matters most of all is to have a true present. Doing so is very
difficult. We spend so much of our lives dwelling on past regrets and/
or fantasizing future disasters or hopes.
   It takes a long time to grow in wisdom, to say nothing of the time
it takes to think well.
   If you truly want to be free, give up judging, comparing and needing
to know why.
   Be happy. That is not a nice wish like ""have a nice day."" It is an
instruction. In a world like ours it is a moral obligation to be
joyful.

   I am grateful that we have the opportunity to revisit these, and
other, notions as the circumstances of our lives and our lives
themselves continue to ebb and flow with the passing of time.

   A very dear friend of mine, Linda McCleskey, who lives in Seattle,
sent me a poem that is fitting to close this celebration of gratitude
with:

         A Poem by Starhawk

              Community.

   Somewhere, there are people
   to whom we can speak with passion
   without having the words catch in our throats.
   Somewhere a circle of hands will open to receive us,
   eyes will light up as we enter, voices will celebrate with us
   whenever we come into our own power.
   Community means strength that joins our strength
   to do the work that needs to be done.
   Arms to hold us when we falter.
   A circle of healing. A circle of friends.
   Someplace where
   we can be free.

   I'm glad that this gathering which we call Ordinary Life is that for
those of us who choose to be present.

   This has gotten to be my closing ritual/blessing to you:
   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

Crude Oil Futures Continue Downward Spiral

Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.89 to 
$17.97 per barrel yesterday, settling below $18.00 per barrel for the 
first time since November of 1999. The session low of $17.80 per 
barrel was the lowest level for front month crude since it hit an 
intraday low of $17.29 per barrel last November. The last 9 sessions 
have seen February crude futures plunge by $3.51 per barrel with an 
unusually mild winter slicing demand and swelling oil and products 
stockpiles, which were already far higher than normal as air travel 
nose-dived and a recession set in after the September 11th attacks. 
Already down 30% lower since the September attacks, prices have 
dropped further after the API report showed total crude and product 
inventories rising to their highest level since August 1999. Many 
doubt OPEC's ability to maintain its modest level of quota discipline 
after it and rival exporters agreed to cut almost 2 million bpd from 
the worlds supplies. Traders are concerned that if January supply 
figures showed that producers have not cut back as much as they 
promised, confidence in the agreement could quickly disintegrate. 
Heating oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX fell $0.0176 
to $0.5145 per gallon. February gasoline futures on the NYMEX lost 
$0.0224 to $0.5361 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for 
March delivery were down $0.62 to $18.41 per barrel.

New Trinidad Oil Field

     Trinidad and Tobago will receive between $2.6 billion and $3.5 
billion from a major oil find there by BHP Billiton. When the oil 
field comes on stream in 2004, BHP hopes to double current local oil 
production of 100,000 bpd over its life cycle which he estimates at 
17 years. Minimum reserves are around 300 million barrels. BHP plans 
to invest $500 million over the next few years to develop the Greater 
Angostura field off the northeast coast.

Unions Urge Senate to Pass Energy Bill 

    Several major trade unions have joined the president in urging 
the Senate to pass an energy bill that allows drilling in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. The unions favor the bill because of the 
large number of jobs it will create for their workers. The Senate 
majority leader has said the chamber, which is controlled by 
Democrats, will take up energy legislation later this month. 
Democrats favor another plan to triple the amount renewable power in 
use and outlaw the use of the additive MTBE in gasoline within 4 
years. Some Democratic senators have vowed to prevent the bill from 
passing. One senator has suggested the use parliamentary procedures 
to prevent the Senate from even considering ANWR exploration. The 
presidents of the Teamsters Union and United Brotherhood of 
Carpenters are pushing senate leaders to pass the presidents bill in 
the first week of February, and have criticized the Senate for 
politicizing the energy legislation. A 10-year old study by the API 
concluded that ANWR drilling could create up to 700,000 new jobs. 
However, critics of drilling in the refuge put the number at a much 
lower 46,000 jobs and called the API study bogus. Foreign oil imports 
accounts for 57% of the nations supply. The 16 billion barrels of oil 
the Arctic refuge may hold would be enough crude to replace Iraqi 
exports for 70 years, according to Republicans. The energy bill 
passed by the Republican-controlled House would also give $33.5 
billion in tax breaks and incentives to oil and coal companies.

Suncor 4th Quarter Profits Drop
  

    Suncor Energy has reported that earnings dropped by 77% in profit 
for the 4th quarter, citing higher than expected start-up costs for 
its oil sands expansion and falling oil and natural gas prices. 
Suncor's report led off what is expected to be the industry's weakest 
Canadian quarter in about two years. Fourth quarter profits were C$26 
million, or C$0.09 per share, falling from C$111 million, or C$0.46 
per share a year earlier. Cash flow fell 38% to C$133 million, from 
C$216 million in the 4th quarter of 2000. Revenues of C$883 million, 
were down 5% from C$927 million. Suncor is known for its oil sands 
mining and synthetic crude processing operation in Alberta. The 
company completed its 4-year, C$3.4 billion Project Millennium, which 
almost doubled production to 225,000 bpd at the end of last year. 
Suncor says that with Project Millennium completed, it can now focus 
on getting back to basics in 2002. Results were also affected by a 
36% drop in refining margins, which erased net earnings at its Sunoco 
gasoline station division. Last week Suncor warned of a dip in profit 
because of cost overruns associated with its oil sand expansion. Oil 
sands production averaged 153,000 bpd in the 4th quarter, up from 
110,000 a year ago. The company expects average first-quarter output 
of about 200,000 bpd and full-year production of 210,000 bpd. Suncor 
also expects cash operating costs for 2002 of C$10 to C$10.50 per 
barrel, it said. For 2001, net earnings rose 3% to C$388 million, or 
C$1.63 per share, from C$377 million, or C$1.58 per share, due to an 
increase in production, and higher natural gas prices and retail 
margins earlier in the year.

Kinder Morgan Beats 4th Quarter and Yearly Estimates

    Kinder Morgan has posted a 4th quarter net income of $72.4 
million, or $0.60 per share, beating the forecast for earnings of 
$0.55 per share. In 2000, it had earnings of $55.3 million, or $0.43 
per share. However, total operating profits slid to $288.6 million 
from $905.7 million in the 4th quarter of 2000. The company said 
earnings were due to KMI's ownership of the general partner of Kinder 
Morgan Energy Partners, which reported 4th-quarter earnings of $120.7 
million, or $0.40 per unit, easily beating the forecast for earnings 
of $0.39 per unit The partnership made $77.1 million, or $0.34  per 
unit, a year ago. KMPs net income for last year was $251.9 million 
pretax compared to $113.3 million a year ago.

When this invoice was input, it was paid to Lea County Courthouse (5000042878) instead of Leaco Rural Telephone (5000019852).  I have a call into Micah to explain the situation and have her return the check.  Who takes care of voiding checks in Houston?  Please let me know, and I'll have her send it in.

Thanks

Tracey,

I received a phone call yesterday from  Mika Aswell (spelling?) from Lea County, NM.  Her county office has received a check from Transwestern and she does not know how to apply it.  Here is what we know:

	Amount:	$7.36
	Check Date:  	December 17, 2001
	Invoice Date:	1-1-2001	#676-3004-0
	Voucher:	0100001479
	Purchase Order:	A60KD13882

Mika's phone number is (505)396-8534.

Can you please track this down and tell me or Mika how to apply this money.

Many thanks, 
Kim X33098

Should we coordinate with you?

"Weekly Report of 1/11/02","California:

CA Legislature.  On Monday Jan. 7th the legislature recovenced and Gov. Davis delivered his State of the State Address on Tuesday.  Davis focused on the projected $12.5 billion budget shortfall and increased education spending.  Gov. Davis pledged he will not advocate increasing taxes and his proposed budget for closing the gap will include a combination of cutbacks, deferred spending, internal borrowing and accelerated revenue.  On Thursday, Assemblyman Herb Wesson, Jr. was elected as Speaker of the Assembly.  Assemblyman Wesson is a Culver City Democrat.  Also on Thursday, Gov. Davis submitted his balanced budget without tax increases.  Key and controversial provisions to cover the shortfall included borrowing from teacher and state worker pension funds, cashing in on future year revenues from the tobacco settlement and spending cuts of $5.2 billion largely from health and welfare programs.  

I99-07-003  SoCalGas Unbundling.  On Jan. 9th SoCalGas held a customer meeting to review their proposed unbundling implementation plan.  This plan will be filed with the CPUC on Jan 17th.  Other key dates included the beginning of the open season for the backbone receipt point capacity which will be held in three phases beginning May 29, 2002, with the third phase ending June 21, 2002 and implementation of transportation under the plan to begin July 1, 2002.  The Core customers were reserved capacity of 313 mmcf/d at Needles.  The remaining capacity of 487.5 mmcf/d will be placed in the open season for bids. 

I00-11-002  Adequacy of SoCal Capacity.  On Monday, the CPUC issued an ALJ ruling requesting parties to submit briefs on the implications of the Unbundling Decision to this proceeding.  Briefs are due January 30, 2002.  Additionally, in the Commissions Infratstructure Report issued last week they cite this system adequacy proceeding as the forum for addressing potential system constraints at two transmission locations (ie San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys).

PG&E Plan of Reorganization.  Along with Enron Corp and Marketing, participated in a conference call regarding PG&E's Plan of Reorganization as related to establishing their backbone system as an InTERstate, open access pipeline.  PG&E is seeking approval of its plan by the Debtors Committee and FERC by mid-2002.  They filed a Section 7(c) Application on Nov. 30, 2001 to establish this interstate company given a temporary name of GTRAN.  During this ""transition"" period current rates remain in effect.  Their plan is to make a Section 4 filing after receiving FERC approval of the current filing.  PG&E requested that Enron and Transwestern file in support of the plan.  No committment was made as we are continuing to evaluate our position.  Interventions are due January 29, 2002.

"GPCM News: 1/13/02: New GPCM and GDS Versions Available","Dear Licensee,

 

We have just completed and uploaded new versions of the GPCM User
Interface, the PowerPoint ""Automaps"" and the GDS Graphical Display
System.

 

Version 9.0.8.4 of the User Interface has changes that work in
conjunction with the new GDS.  In addition, a few bugs were found and
cleaned up.

 

The automaps are totally updated to match RDI / Platt's recent Jan02base
release.

 

The new GDS has two major new features:

 

1.	You can now select all pipelines by state
2.	You can now display results by month, by year, and by average of
several years

 

Our next release is planned to have two new features as well:

 

1.	Display results for any season (summer, winter)
2.	Display receipt and delivery clearing prices for each pipeline
zone (month, year, average of several years, season)

 

We have one design issue which we would like your input on:

 

When displaying by season, we can define the winter as a continguous
5-month period, Nov-2001 through Mar-2002, for example, or we can define
winter for a year as Jan through Mar and Nov through Dec of the same
calendar year.

 

Our question is do you have a preference for one of these approaches?

 

Please let me know right away.

 

You can download the new user interface and GDS in the usual manner
through the GPCM or RBAC websites.

***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

Crude Oil Futures Gain on OPEC Compliance


    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.06 to 
$20.05 per barrel yesterday, after a estimate showed an 89% adherence 
by OPEC to its most recent set of quotas. The gain marked the 6th day 
in a row that crude futures have risen. A report from Petrologistics 
said that OPEC's January production, excluding Iraq, was 22.25 
million bpd, still above its monthly quota of 21.7 million bpd. 
However, it seems that OPEC's compliance with their quotas is much 
improved compared to previous output curbs. The 10 OPEC countries 
with quotas trimmed output by 1.4 million bpd, according to the 
report, not far from the cartels pledge to lower production by 1.5 
million bpd. A possible fly in the ointment is that the report only 
covers the 1st three weeks of the month and lower production could be 
due to a slow start after the beginning of the year. A sudden surge 
in production during the last week of the month would skew the 
figures. Forecasts for balmy weather in much of the Northeast kept 
the lid on crude prices ahead of the weekly inventory data. Heating 
oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.0006 to 
$0.5313 per gallon. February gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell 
$0.0017 to $0.5811 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for 
March delivery on the IPE were up $0.28 to $19.65 per barrel.

Senate Considers Improved Fuel Efficiency 

    A provision to require improved fuel efficiency requirements for 
vehicles is expected to be approved by a Senate committee in the next 
few weeks. A draft copy of the energy bill circulated last month 
called for increasing the fuel efficiency of cars built between years 
2007 and 2010 to 36 mpg, and 27.5 mpg for light trucks. Those figures 
are much higher than the current Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
standards, which require cars to average 27.5 mpg and light trucks to 
get 20.7 mpg. US automakers say that higher fuel efficiency 
requirements would force them to make vehicles that are more 
expensive and lighter, and possibly less safe. But Honda disagrees, 
saying that fuel economy could be improved in an affordable way 
without affecting safety.

Centrica to Buy Enbridge Assets


    Centrica, the UK's largest natural gas supplier, has agreed to 
buy the building-services units of Canada's Enbridge for C$1 billion 
in cash to add to its customer base in the US and Canada. The 
purchase will give Centrica 1.3 million heating, ventilation and air-
conditioning clients to whom it also hopes to sell natural gas and 
power. It already has almost 2 million customers in North America. 
Centrica, which has estimated its exposure to Enron at up to $43 
million, has been diversifying abroad to reduce its concentration in 
the UK. The company is still about 6 million customers short of its 
2003 goal of 10 million users in North America by the end of 2003. 
Enbridge plans to spend C$5 billion over the next 5 years to expand 
its delivery systems. The company's credit rating was lowered by S&P 
last month after a $330 million bid for a stake in a Spanish 
pipeline. The asset sale was unrelated to the credit rating cut. 
Centrica, which was spun off from British Gas in 1997, plans to use 
existing debt to pay for the sale. Centrica has 900,000 natural gas 
customers, or about 25% of the Ontario market. It also has 600,000 
clients who have signed up to switch to the company when Ontario's 
power market is deregulated on May 1st. More than 50% of its North 
American customers are in Ontario and it is the 2nd largest natural 
gas supplier in the province. The company says it is expanding from 
just offering natural gas and power into a value-added businesses 
that include servicing, similar to British Gas in the UK. The 
companies that Centrica has agreed to buy had assets of C$676 million 
and pre-tax earnings of C$55 million at the end of the 3rd-quarter. 
Centrica expects to close the deal by June. The company agreed to buy 
Enron's British energy supply business and some assets for 96.4 
million pounds in cash last month. Centrica, which controls more than 
70% of the natural gas market in the UK, now offers credit card, 
insurance, telecommunications and in addition to energy.

Exxon Mobil Replaces 110% of Production

    Exxon Mobil has replaced 110% of the oil and natural gas it 
produced last year after raising its spending even as  prices 
dropped. Exxon Mobil also increased its capital spending 10% last 
year and expects to do the same this year. It added the equivalent of 
1.8 billion barrels of oil to its reserves in 2001. Last year marked 
the 8th consecutive year that reserve additions have exceeded 
production. Helped by projects in the deep-waters of the Gulf of 
Mexico and Alaska's North Slope, the company replaced 109% of its oil 
and natural gas of production in North America. Other additions came 
from projects in Qatar, Norway, Malaysia, Equatorial Guinea, 
Kazakhstan and Australia. Exxon Mobil had 21.6 billion barrels of 
proved oil and natural gas reserves at the end of last year. At 
current production rates, that is sufficient to last more than 13 
years. Exxon Mobil produced 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels in 
2001.

Unocal Replaces 222% of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production

    Unocal has replaced more than 222% of its worldwide crude oil and 
natural gas production during 2001 with new proved reserves. At the 
end of last year, Unocal's estimate of worldwide reserves was 1.81 
billion barrels of oil equivalent, up 15% from 1.58 billion BOE the 
year before. Unocal booked its 1st reserves from the Mad Dog field in 
the Gulf of Mexico, and added reserves in Azerbaijan, Thailand, 
Indonesia, the Gulf of Mexico region, onshore Texas and Alaska. 
During 2001, it added reserves of 241 million BOE from discoveries 
and extensions and improved recovery. Reserve acquisitions onshore 
Texas, in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, Brazil and Canada totaled 113 
million BOE. Unocal also made net upward revisions of 80 million BOE 
because of price effects and reservoir performance. Because of cost 
recovery provisions in certain production-sharing contracts, reserves 
increase when prices decline. Production of 193 million BOE and the 
sale of 5 million BOE in reserves partially offset the increases. For 
2001, initial worldwide finding and development costs were $5.39 per 
BOE. Unocal's preliminary estimated worldwide finding, development 
and acquisition costs for new reserves were $6.18 per BOE.

Residual Fuel Market Tumbles on Warm Weather

    The market for residual fuel on the East and Gulf coasts tumbled 
yesterday on the back of 60-degree weather in New York and 70-degree 
weather in Houston. A deal for 50,000 barrels of 1.0%-sulfur residual 
fuel was done in New York Harbor at $14.90 per barrel, down $0.35 per 
barrel. It is likely the market could be even lower today. The market 
for 0.3%-sulfur high pour material managed to hold around $16.50 per 
barrel, but 3.0%-sulfur fuel was down $0.25 per barrel and quoted 
around $14.00 per barrel. February swaps for 1.0%-material on the 
East Coast fell $0.40 per to $14.95, while March declined $0.35 to 
$15.05. Second quarter was quoted in the range of $15.40-$15.50, down 
$0.30 per barrel. The West Coast market was essentially unchanged 
despite unusually cold weather, which really isn't a factor since 
residual fuel is seldom used as a source of power by utilities there.

Senate Committee to Vote on Energy Tax Breaks and Incentives
    
    The Senate Finance Committee has scheduled a vote on energy tax 
breaks and incentives. The committee had been considering between $10 
billion - $15 billion in tax breaks, but the cost of the war on 
terrorism and the recession could affect the final amount. Both 
Republican and Democratic lawmakers are pushing for a tax credit for 
small, independent well operators that would go into effect when 
crude prices fall drastically. Supporters say that tax relief is 
needed because marginal wells account for 20% of US oil production. 
Even though both the higher fuel economy requirements and the tax 
breaks will be parts of the Senate's comprehensive energy bill, it is 
unclear when, or if, the full Senate will vote on the bill. Both 
sides of the aisle have threatened a filibuster if ANWR language is 
added to, or deleted from the final bill. The House has already 
passed an energy bill, which would permit drilling in ANWR and 
provide over $33 billion in energy tax breaks and incentives. If the 
Senate passes a bill, a compromise would have to be reached before 
the legislation could make its way to the presidents desk for his 
signature.

"RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.","Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of January 13, 2002

===========================================

Dear Folks ?

   There is no way I can give a summary of the two touching and
brilliant presentations that were given in the Ordinary Life Gathering
this past Sunday.

   SuZanne and Jennifer Feather gave their individual perspectives and
experiences on dealing with Jennifer's discovery and announcement of
being lesbian.

   Over 150 people attended the presentation.

   When SuZanne and Jennifer were finished they got a well-deserved
standing ovation.

   If you were present you saw examples of courage and love that moved
many to tears. Courage and love are, in my opinion, what the spiritual
journey is all about.

   Audio tapes of the presentation will be available this coming week.
If you live out of town, one can be sent to you. The best way to
expedite this, if you want a tape, would be to send a check to me for
$6.00 made payable to Ordinary Life Gathering. I'll make sure you get a
tape as soon as possible.

               * * *

   Those of you in Houston might be interested in this:

   This Thursday evening at seven o'clock my beautiful bride, Dr.
Sherry Beeman, and I will be conducting a relationship seminar

       Don't Just Communicate,
   Really Connect With Your Partner.""

   The seminar is free but they do request that you register by phone
so they will know how many to prepare for. The number is 713-528-6779.

   The location of the seminar is Fondren Hall in the Jones Building at
St. Paul's.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================
Summary of November 4, 2001
======================================

Dear Folks ?

   This Sunday's Ordinary Life gathering continued to focus on a
spiritual response to the days following the events of 9/11 and
following.
   One of the questions people are raising is: What can we do to be
safe? This presentation responds to that question.

   I shared with you how we realize what we visualize.
   It is important to know the role and use of myth, magic and ritual
in our lives.
   The key to released power for our time and lives is in personal
responsibility.
   It is also important to know the principle of cause and effect.
   We are constantly tempted to forget that life is a gift, that no one
is special, and that change can occur only at the conscious level.
   This presentation also included the principles of ""mind and spirit""
we can use to meet our moral obligation to be happy.

      Dancing in Difficult Times

======================================

   The title of my talk with you today is ""Dancing During Difficult
Times.""

   These are those are they not? At least it seems so. We are assaulted
by news we don't want to hear and yet if we don't pay some attention we
may not know how to be alert.

   I practice my own preaching at this point. I never listen to the
news or look at the paper until after I meditate in the morning. I
believe what the publication ""The Onion"" advised investors when the
market dropped can apply to a multitude of matters. They said,
""Investors are advised to remain calm, and leave the panic to the
professionals."" But even after meditating, when I pick up the New York
Times, it chills me. What's next? Is there any way to be safe?

   I was interviewed for the ten o'clock news Friday night for the NBC
affiliate here. The interview lasted twenty minutes. Twenty seconds got
on the air. During the interview the reporter asked me what I thought
people needed to do to deal with their fear and stay safe during this
time. I said, ""Don't smoke and wear your seat belt.""

   The fact is that far more people die on a regular basis as a result
of cigarette smoking and car accidents than die as a result of the
terror we read about in the paper. I tried to find out exactly how many
by doing a web search but only turned up finds of personal injury
attorneys pleading for your business if you've been in a car accident.

   I think God needs a good lawyer. There are all these crackpots out
there doing hateful things in God's name. I think God's lawyer should
go after them for libel, slander, defamation of character and more. If
you read any of God's books, you won't find God counseling people to
harm the innocent. That is simply not God's desire.

   I think it was Lily Tomlin who noted that if you talk to God, that's
called praying. But if God talks to you, that's schizophrenia. For
anyone to claim that God has told them to do something contrary to
God's will of love is nuts.

   I am asked on a very regular basis by lots of people how do deal
with anxiety during these troubled times. So one answer is to keep a
perspective.

   In 2000, there were 6,394,000 police reported motor vehicle crashes,
an increase of 0.2 percent from 1999.  41,821 people were killed.
3,189,000 people were injured. An average of 115 persons died each day
in 2000? one every 13 minutes. That is more enough than to fill a 747
jumbo jet every single week.

   Let me offer you a perspective on something else. I frequently get
responses from folks - some in person and many by e-mail - about the
value of our gatherings for you. I'm so glad. But listen to this:

   I used to have a play a game as a child. It was a game I used to
play with my cousins. We called it ""playing church."" Yes, we also
played ""doctor"" but my parents made us quit when my cousin tried to
take out a neighbor child's appendix. Church was one of our favorite
games. We would gather in my grandmother's living room where there was
a grand piano and pick parts. Someone would be the ""teacher"" of the
make-believe Sunday school class, someone would be the pianist, someone
would be the song director, etc. Now, I promise you, I never had a
sane/conscious desire to be a parish minister. But notice that is
where, in part, where I've ended up.

   Just this week I had a memory of that childhood playtime and a
realization that I'm living that dream. What that caused to occur in me
is such a deep gratitude for you. If it weren't for you, I couldn't do
this. No matter what happens in here in our times together, I am the
one who is most deeply benefited. So I thank you so much that you make
it possible for my unconscious dream to be true.

   So there is one principle right there is it not? What we visualize
is what we realize.

   The principles I am trying to teach, the method of being I want to
use in my life and present to you, are things I've been trying to get
into my head and heart and hands for at least the past thirty years.
They are so simple and yet we never fully master them. The good news is
that we have the rest of our lives to do that - no matter how long or
short that might be.

   I experience life in some of the same ways that I think you do too.
For example, I frequently stray far off the path of what I teach. I
assume you do too. I can fall for the culture's notion about security.
You know, we begin to believe that there is something we can do to stay
safe.

   My eye condition has been a great teacher for me at this point. One
day out of the blue I began to have these flashers in my left eye. Each
time I had surgery, I was confident I was on the other side of the
difficulty. Surely, I thought, things would get back to normal. But the
surgery failed. I had another one. It failed. Another one. Then two
Sundays ago, more flashers. An emergency session with the surgeon on
Monday revealed scar tissue forming on the retina causing the retina to
bunch up in that place and thus tug at the edges of the retina risking
more tears and a resulting detachment. I sat there dumbfounded as the
surgeon informed me that there is nothing that can be done about this.
Just wait and see what happens. It will either go away or it won't. Ah,
the lesson of patience. Though I confess, I'm kind of tired of
attending this particular class held by my eye. Mother Teresa once
said, ""I know God never gives me more than I can handle, but sometimes
I wish He didn't have so much confidence in me.""

   One of the ways that we can more successfully move through these
days of our lives is to pay careful attention to the role of myth,
magic and ritual in our lives. Every week across the street we act out
a great ritual. And it itself is in the context of a great ritual and
mythic story. We will begin, in a few weeks, this mythic story all over
again - the first Sunday in Advent will lead us day by day all the way
to the greatness of Easter morning and the Pentecost celebration that
follows fifty days after that.

   We go over this myth year after year. Not because we don't know it
but because we draw strength from participating in it. It doesn't
change but our understanding of it does, our lives change, our
circumstances change.

   Just so with the principles of Ordinary Life. If we don't have ways
to remind us of the principles of Ordinary Life, we'll drift away and
become very frightened or cynical or lost.

   In our society there are notions that function as gods that lead us
far astray from who we really are and what life is really about. Money
is one of our gods, isn't it? Status can be? And there are many others.

   Our task is to dethrone these things and learn how life really works
and make what we learn help us create the life we want and want the
life we have. We are not what we do. We are not what we have. Life is
in our being.

   Another way of stating this is that we create the world we live in
by our beliefs. The world-view we hold is responsible for the quality
of our lives. We are responsible for the content of our lives. No
terrorist is responsible for the content of my life. I am one hundred
percent responsible. This is the key to released power. The
understanding you have of your world is your religion.

   These are not comfortable teachings for us. Why is that? Well, the
fundamental bottom line reason is that if we look at life as it is we
have to face up to our death and that is just too much. Don't worry,
I'm not going there - right now.

   For the moment, let's think about cause and effect and see if we can
use this principle to help us live the principle of our having a moral
obligation to be happy even though we are assaulted by news we don't
want to hear about terrorist attacks, anthrax and all that jazz.

   The law of cause and effect means: This is this way because that is
that way.

   Cause and effect means that everything is connected to everything.

   When you are working with this principle, it is critically important
to practice non-judgment.

   Most of us have some notion of what it would mean to live heroically
in the face of whatever life has to dish out to us. Right? We know of
people like Helen Keller or Ann Frank who lived their lives in the
midst of and in spite of difficult times. So, we know what heroic
living looks like.

   But notice also how easy it is for us to fall off the path.

   When I was at Harvard there was a prayer we prayed: ""Dear God,
deliver me from the sin of intellectual pride - which, for your
information means . . .""

   It is so easy to fall off the path. And, also notice, the
consequences when we do. Let's look at some truths about life and how
quickly and easily we can move away from them.

   For example:

   Life is a gift but we live as if we had to work to earn it.

   None of us is special but we live lives of intense competition.

   The only way you can change your life is at the consciousness level
but we act like we can change it at the material level through what we
have and/or do.

   Get this: What you are about is love. There is no way you can be
about something else. You are created in the image of love. You can
withhold love or distort it but you can't get away from it.

   I've been using the phrase ""principle of equality"" in my teachings
with you lately. If we come at life, if we come at other nations, if we
come at our relationships committed to inequality, we are not going to
experience life. But we learn the principle of inequality early. One of
you sent me this -

   ""Just had to email you this before I forgot.
   ""Today in the last service there was a little boy sitting behind me
with his parents. He must have been about 4 or 5 yrs old. During the
baptism, he says in a startled voice (trying to whisper... but not
quite managing to): 'Oh my gosh! That is a real live baby up there! I
didn't know they let babies into church. They don't know 'nuthin!'
   ""I had to grin. If he only knew that is why the rest of us are here.
;-)""

   Often we try to practice our spiritual principles when it is
comfortable and convenient for us. But when a tragedy strikes we revert
to defensive and reactionary beliefs and behaviors. You cannot ride two
horses with one behind. Otherwise you are going to get real sore. You
will become known as what is called - a lost soul.

   I have found a ton of help in Buddhist psychology and practices.
Whatever your religious beliefs are, I believe, this can be true for
you too. One of the things I've learned by investigating this territory
is that there are principles that accurately describe the way life
works. If we know these and live them, we will be happier people. We
will have more of the life we want.

   When, years ago, I first tried to translate these principles into my
own life and language, the way I worded them was like this.

   1. What we believe creates the world we live in. All that we
accomplish with our lives is a direct result of our thoughts. We are
what we think and our character is the complete sum of our thoughts.
Individual responsibility for this must be absolute.

   This is the way Buddha put it -

   ""The thought manifests as the word.
    The word manifests as the deed.
    The deed develops into habit.
    And habit hardens into character.
    So watch the thought and its ways with care.
    And let it spring from love,
    Born out of concern for all being.""

   2. By and large we get in life what we expect to get.

   3. We have a tendency to attract into our lives those events and
experiences that harmonize with out dominant belief systems.

   If I were to ask you to go into the next room and count all of the
blue things you see, I'm sure you could do that. You could come back
and report some number of your counting. But, then, if I were to ask
you, ""While you were in there, how many brown things did you see?"" your
report would be non-existent or not accurate because brown is not what
you were looking for. This is called sorting. What do you sort for? We
do this also by the questions we ask ourselves every morning as we are
beginning our day.

   4. What we dwell on grows in our experience. This says something
about the importance of meditation and prayer.

   5. You can hold only one thought at a time. If you don't like what
is in your mind, replace it, substitute it with something else. This is
the principle of substitution.

   6. Then there is the principle of work or practice. I talked to the
reporter about the importance of being present. She thought for a
moment and said, ""That's very hard to do. How do you learn to do it?""
My response: ""Like learning any other skill: You practice.""

   I don't know a thing in the world worth doing that doesn't take
practice and work.

   When the first astronauts made it to the moon and were walking
about, one of them said, ""This seems like old home week."" What did that
mean? It meant that they had practiced that walk so much in simulation
that it seemed familiar to them.

   7. Relaxation and play. This is one of the most important needs of
the Self, of the soul. We are, in different many ways, to practice a
""Sabbath"" in our lives. So many of us don't. We just work, work, work.
""Play,"" by the way, doesn't mean the competitive combat so many engage
in and ""rest"" doesn't mean sleeping and napping.

   One of the biggest causes that keeps people from finding
satisfaction in life is playing into the victim mentality. The victim
mentality, simply defined, is that outlook or attitude that says, ""My
life is essentially at the mercy of vast powerful forces out there and
beyond my control. Therefore, I am at the mercy of:

   - My history, my upbringing, my genes, my heritage.
   - My social class, my education (or lack of it), or my IQ (or lack
of it.)
   - My parents, my teachers, or an invalid relative.
   - My mate, my partner.
   - My boss, my supervisor, my manager, or my co-workers.
   - The economy, the times we live in, the social structure, or our
form of government.
   - The politicians, the large corporations, or the rich.
   - Some particular enemy, who is out to get me, and who has great
power.

   The Victim Mentality ultimately discharges you from any
responsibility for your life, since clearly what is happening to you is
not your fault.

   I'm not saying there are no victims. Let a good hurricane occur
around here and folks are made victims quickly.

   But there is a vast difference between being a victim and having a
victim mentality. One means dealing heroically with what you have to
deal with and the other means giving up. I believe each one of us
always has more control over our lives than we think is the case. No
matter how much of our life we see as unchangeable, there is always
that part that is under our control and that we can work on to change.
Even if it is only 2%, it is almost always more than we think.

   Although we work in some predictable ways, almost machine like,
we're not machines. You can cut a machine off. What you believe,
however, continually does something with the energy that is going
through you. If you are afraid of losing your job, if you are afraid of
losing your mate, if you are afraid there will never be a ""Mr. not-so-
wrong"" for you, guess what? The universe is going to support you in
having those be your life experiences.

   Here is something I have mentioned to you before but it fits again
in this context. There is a risk we need to keep in our minds. We have
parts of our lives we are not clear about. Affecting this lack of
clarity are forces in our society, powerful forces, that are focused on
us all the time. These are in the form of television, radio,
newspapers, magazines, sales-persons, employers, relatives, and
friends. They have many ideas about what we should be thinking. When we
avoid making clear decisions about what is best for us, we tend to
adopt the ideas of these other sources, without even being aware that
we are doing it.

   It is like your being is a sponge. You can fill the sponge with
love, forgiveness, peace, confidence, abundance, affirmation,
gratitude, and joy. OR, we can leave the sponge partly dry and the
world will fill it for us. That's why we need to practice a way that
keeps the quality of life experience we want for ourselves in our
consciousness. That's our choice. When we don't make it, someone else
will make it for us.

   Okay. What might be a practical application of this? If these
principles are true and if the ultimate nature of all that is is love,
then, how are we to live?

   I believe we are more in alignment with the purpose for our lives
when we are experiencing and expressing the following:
   Love,
    peace,
     forgiveness,
      confidence (hope),
       abundance,
        affirmation (faith),
         gratitude, and
          joy and happiness.

   Whatever your specific purpose is, these states of being fit your
basic purpose in life.

   So, here is the process.

   First, we look around and notice what is.

   Second, we accept it - without judgment of any kind. This sometimes
requires practice. The skill you are practicing here is forgiveness.
Or, the principle of 100% responsibility.

   Until we learn to bring mindfulness to every aspect of our lives, a
stance of mindfulness all the time, everywhere - we are in hell. If you
wait for the circumstances of your life to change before you develop
mindfulness, you'll never get there. We can easily fall into being
dependent on others without even realizing it.

   It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their
new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild.
   Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been
taught the old secrets, and when he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell
what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side,
he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and
that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.
   But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an
idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service
and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""
   ""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the
meteorologist at the weather service responded.
   So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even
more wood in order to be prepared.
   A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it
going to be a very cold winter?""
   ""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's
definitely going to be a very cold winter.""
   The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect
every scrap of wood they could find.
   Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are
you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""
   ""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest
winters ever.""
   ""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.
   The weatherman replied, ""The Indians are collecting wood like
crazy.""

   Then, third, you practice experiencing and/or expressing one of the
states of being that reflects your spiritual beliefs.

   Let me give you an example one of you offered me.

   Recently Dr. Bob Bell visited Istanbul. You might remember that he
made comments in here about his visit to a mosque there. After
returning to Houston, he wrote the following letter to their tour
guide:

   ""We want to thank you so much for your kindness, patience, charm,
and wit while putting up with us. We arrived back in Houston, Texas,
without incident on October 10th.
   ""Our country continues to be traumatized and anxious. Now it is
Anthrax that has us in a panic. We have had things too easy for too
long over here. This may be God's wake up call to us and we are finding
it difficult to accept.
   ""In church this morning, we read the following from Paul's second
letter to Timothy (New Testament - Christian Bible). This is a portion:
'For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound
doctrine, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves
teachers to suit their own desires, and will turn away from listening
to the truth and wander away to myths. As for you, always be sober,
endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, carry out your ministry
fully.'
   ""I think this applies to both of our faiths and I encourage you and
all others to live your religion fully and with a burning devotion.
Together we will defeat this thing and come out stronger and closer in
our love for each other. We will not have another 'Crusade.' We ride
together this time. May God/Allah/Yahweh richly bless us all.""

   There is a rhythm to this dance. The first step is made as quickly
as possible. The second may take a bit longer if there is homework to
do. We want to make the third one last as long as possible.

   Think about it: If you learn to be present, the dance takes place
all by itself. You are aware of the flowing feelings within you
starting with love. I love so much about and within life. From that
love flows a sense anguish and despair when I realize that I can't hold
on to anything or anyone I love. That is followed by a sense of wonder
and awe that I have been permitted to participate in any of it. What
flows from that is a sense of victory and triumph. And from that a
sense of joy. And from that joy a sense of awe at the wonder of it all.
Which ends up leading me once again to love. Which causes the dance to
start all over again. That's the flow. Our job is to learn to celebrate
every aspect of it.

   Let me read you an embodiment of this in a recent message from the
Hopi Elders:

   ""You have been telling the people that this is the Eleventh Hour.
   Now you must go back and tell the people that this is the Hour.
   And there are things to be considered:
   Where are you living?
   What are you doing?
   What are your relationships?
   Are you in right relation?
   Where is your water?
   Know your garden.
   It is time to speak your Truth.
   Create your community.
   Be good to each other.
   And do not look outside yourself for the leader.
   This could be a good time!
   There is a river flowing now very fast.
   It is so great and swift that there are those who will be afraid.
   They will try to hold on to the shore.
   They will feel they are being torn apart, and they will suffer
greatly.
   Know the river has its destination.
   The elders say we must let go of the shore, push off into the middle
of the river, keep our eyes open, and our heads above the water.
   See who is in there with you and celebrate.
   At this time in history, we are to take nothing personally.
   Least of all, ourselves.
   For the moment that we do, our spiritual growth and journey comes to
a halt. The time of the lone wolf is over. Gather yourselves!
   Banish the word struggle from your attitude and your vocabulary.
   All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in
celebration.
   We are the ones we've been waiting for.""
   The Elders
   Oraibi, Arizona
Hopi Nation""

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

"RE: imbal summaries","Prices should close above last month so we don't expect an imbalance revaluation hit in October.  We will continue monitoring prices, at this time the margin is too small to count for much.

Richard Hanagriff, at the staff meeting today TW linepack was too full, is this due to imbalance payback in?  If so who is doing it.  Call me and we will discuss.

Mr. John Shages, Director of Economic Planning, Policy, and Finance for the
United State's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) will address the World
Energy Security and Commerce forum on January 24, 2002. (http://www.wesc.org )

Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve up to capacity will strengthen the long-term energy
security of the United States. Since its inception, the circumstances that might require the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have been defined in the Energy Policy and Conservation
Act. Yet each time economic or political circumstances bring the SPR into focus, questions, concerns, and misunderstandings ARE abound.  Mr. Shages will address firsthand the reasons behind the formation of the SPR, the circumstances under which it may be used, and the economics behind its administration. Topics such as inventory levels, drawdown capabilities,
exchanges and sales will be discussed in relation to today's domestic
security needs and concerns.""

"RE: Procedures for Transwestern Gas Control/Marketing Morning Meetings","        Please ignore the previous memo.  I had a wrong date in it.  Thanks. Lynn

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.
 
Lynn

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Evaluation - No Go

The economic evaluation of applying drag reducing agent to the La Plata to Bloomfield line indicates it is not justified.  Tracy indicated that if the launchers and receivers were installed as a part of the pipeline integrity program, the incremental cost of DRA application may then be economically beneficial.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this effort.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for October 28, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks ?

   Shortly after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, I had a meal with
Michael Butera. We get together and talk about our spiritual journeys.
I find him a most gifted spiritual being. After listening to him for I
while, I asked him if he would be willing to come and speak to our
Ordinary Life Gathering. He his agreed to do so this Sunday.

   His title will be:

""Fear, What Is It and How to Handle It""

   This is what he says about this topic:

   ""Finding ourselves alive in an independent form, vulnerable and
subject to death, we become frightened, afraid of extinction. This fear
is then projected on all our experience. Especially today we may find
that our usual consolations are not doing the trick. Like the ""bottom""
reached in an addiction, we will become overwhelmed with our fear or
discover that fear is a characteristic that is unnecessary - just as an
addict discovers that the object of addiction is not necessary. What a
blessed discovery this is.""

   Do yourself a spiritual favor and come to hear this spiritual
fellow.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an
enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present
moment.

The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

James,

What do you think?  Can we do the 20 year thing?

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

Hi Lorraine,

I received an OBA agreement by fax.  Can you send one by e-mail so that I
can forward to our attorney for review and comment?

Also, did you ever get a final accounting of the Outlaw interconnect?

Crude Oil Futures Inch Upward

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX inched 
upward by $0.03 to $18.00 per barrel in an abbreviated session on 
Friday. The IEA reported that OPEC exports moved closer to the 
cartels limits. According to the agency, the cartels total 
production, including Iraq, dropped from 26.04 million bpd in 
November to 25.65 million bpd for December. However, excluding Iraq, 
the other 10 members of OPEC increased their December production by 
380,000 bpd to 23.65 million bpd, still above its self-imposed limits 
of 23.2 million bpd. The IEA said that global oil demand rose 100,000 
bpd last year, the smallest rise since 1985. For 2002, the agency 
projects a 600,000 bpd increase in oil consumption, assuming an 
economic recovery has begun by mid-year. In the US, inventories are 
at their highest levels in over 2 years as the peak heating oil 
season slips into spring. OPECs latest production cut on January 1st 
has yet to be felt in the US and there are many concerns about the 
degree to which exports have been reduced. The IEA says that the 
implementation of the production cut commitments have the potential 
to support crude prices and set the stage for later price gains. A 
draw in oil stocks should deepen in the 1st quarter because of the 
cuts, and an expected seasonal build in the 2nd quarter should be 
less than previously expected, the IEA said. Heating oil futures for 
February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.0004 to $0.5141 per gallon. 
February gasoline futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0031 to $0.5392 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the 
IPE were up $0.04 to $18.45 per barrel.

California Nears Deadline to Remove MTBE from Gasoline 

    California has until the end of this year to remove MTBE from 
gasoline and replace it with ethanol. But state officials are worried 
they won't meet the deadline and that could drive up gasoline prices. 
The delay could also prove a problem for the governor. In early 1999, 
he declared MTBE a threat because studies showed it was leaking into 
the state's groundwater. He ordered it banned by the end of 2002, in 
favor of ethanol, which is made from corn. But three years later, 
MTBE is still in use in the state's reformulated gasoline. The 
gasoline additive problem has parallels to last year's energy crisis. 
Davis faces several infrastructure obstacles to getting ethanol-based 
fuel in California. Last year, US ethanol production was more than 
1.8 billion gallons. California will need nearly 950 million gallons 
per year, requiring a production increase. That increase would 
necessitate production and transportation upgrades for the ethanol 
plants, which are behind schedule in making the changes. It also 
requires an estimated $100 million in new equipment and refineries in 
California. A lack of rail transport could also contribute to supply 
problems, making gasoline prices rise as much as $0.50 per gallon.

Book Predicts Imminent Decline of World Oil Supplies 
  

    Even though the world is now experiencing what appears to be an 
overabundance of oil, with lowered demand and brimming inventories, a 
new book ""Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage"" advances 
the idea that crude oil supplies will peak within the next 7 years, 
then slowly begin to dwindle. The book contends that the world will 
not be prepared to deal with the situation when the peak in 
production occurs. The book says several events could zap supplies 
and create an energy crisis, including a big war in the Middle East. 
It points out that while there still may be a few huge oilfields left 
to discover, most have, or will shortly reach their maximum output 
level and begin to dry up. According to the book, most new 
discoveries since 1975 have been mediocre. The book is based on 
theories by a geologist who accurately predicted in the mid 1950s 
that US crude production would reach its zenith in 1970. The US now 
depends on imports for over half of its crude consumption. Critics of 
the theory do not argue with the eventual outcome, but they do argue 
that the timetable is too severe. They acknowledge that there will be 
a day when the world's oil output will start to shrivel, but point 
out that improved technologies and economies will delay the decline. 
Many believe that there is still sufficient oil supply in the Middle 
East, but Western powers have imposed economic sanctions that have 
restricted its production. In addition, new technologies being 
developed will decrease demand, expanding the timetable for the 
deterioration of oil supplies. Detractors point to the increased 
usage of natural gas, development of fuel cells, conservation, new 
methods that allow oil sands mining as well as solar, wind and 
geothermal technologies will diminish dependence upon oil as a fuel.

Refiners to Begin Seasonal Maintenance Early

    Poor refining margins and sizable gasoline imports expected from 
Europe have prompted some US refiners to begin planned 1st quarter 
maintenance earlier than usual this year. The shut down of refineries 
for retooling could mean that gasoline stocks may not build as fast 
as usual in the near future, but plants should be ready to produce at 
high levels leading into the peak summer driving season. Summer 
gasoline prices will likely be less than the last 2 years, but the 
seasonal rise in gasoline demand should cause retail prices to rise 
above current levels. Valero has announced an ambitious schedule for 
planned maintenance at half of its refineries. Orion, ChevronTexaco, 
Citgo, Premcor, and Crown Central all have gasoline units down for 
maintenance which are expected to return to operation in February. 
ChevronTexaco's 295,000 bpd Pascagoula, MS refinery and Citgo's 
310,000 bpd Lake Charles, LA refinery are expected to close their 
gasoline units for scheduled maintenance sometime in the first 
quarter. Venezuela's state oil company will shutdown a 108,000 bpd 
gasoline unit in early February. The scheduled maintenance is not 
expected to produce the restricted supply that the nation experienced 
last year when gasoline futures hit a record of $1.17 per gallon in 
May. Gasoline demand has been unexpectedly heavy recently, spurred on 
by low prices, a decrease in flying since September 11th and record 
sales late last year for SUVs. However, isolated markets in the 
Midwest and California, where a lack of pipeline capacity and heavy 
environmental controls on gasoline limit supply options, could see 
prices spike.

CNOOC to Purchase Repsol's Indonesian Assets


    CNOOC has agreed to buy the Indonesian assets of Spanish oil 
major Repsol-YPF for $585 million in cash, its biggest international 
expansion ever. The purchase will bring 360 million barrels of oil 
equivalent in proved net working interest reserves and add 15 ? 20 
million BOE to CNOOC's annual output. Standard & Poor's estimated in 
a report that the acquisition would increase daily output by 17% to 
356,000 BOE in 2002, and boost reserves to 1.985 billion BOE. CNOOC 
is now targeting 2002 output of 125 ? 130 million BOE. Its previous 
target was 110 million BOE. CNOOC plans to keep its annual output 
growth rate of 15% in the next several years, and estimates its 2001 
output at 95 million BOE. For Repsol, the sale is part of its 
longstanding strategy of selling non-core assets to reduce its $20 
billion debt. Repsol plans to cut its capitalization ratio, debt to 
market cap plus debt, to 30% - 35% from 47% at the end of the 3rd 
quarter. The acquisition will make CNOOC the largest offshore oil 
producer in Indonesia. It already has a presence there through a 
39.5% interest in the Malacca Strait production-sharing contract. 
Merrill Lynch is the advisor to the acquisition. CNOOC expects its 
capital expenditure for 2002 to reach $1.5 ? $1.6 billion, including 
the purchase.

Shell Begins Production from Two New Gulf of Mexico Fields

    Two new sub-sea fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Crosby and Einset, 
have started up, according to Shell Exploration & Production. All 
three wells at the Crosby development, located in Mississippi Canyon 
Blocks 898 and 899, are online and producing 20,000 barrels of oil 
per day. Peak production for Crosby is expected to be 60,000 bpd and 
90 MMcf per day by the end of the first quarter. Shell operates 
Crosby, located in 4,400 feet of water, and has a 50% interest in the 
project. BP owns the other 50%. Einset is currently producing at a 
rate of 30 MMcf per day. It is expected to recover in excess of 30 
Bcf of natural gas. Peak production is expected to reach at least 60 
MMcf per day. It is located in 3,500 feet of water and is a single 
well project located in Viosca Knoll Block 872. Shell operators

"RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding","I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to ""shippers"", we could refer to ""customers"" instead.

Subject:	RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

"Can't Please Everyone","
Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

FERC Gives OK to North Baja Pipeline

Jan. 16 -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave final approval
on Wednesday to the U.S. segment of the North Baja Pipeline project that
will bring natural gas from Mexico to fuel electric generating plants in
southern California and northern Mexico. The $230 million pipeline will
be operated by an international subsidiary of Sempra Energy , PG&E Corp.
and Mexico-based Proxima Gas S.A. de C.V. The 215-mile pipeline (346-km)
would carry up to 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. FERC
gave final approval for the project after determining the pipeline would
not harm the environment.

From the Anchorage Daily News:

 

University of Houston Study Favors Phased Development of Northern
Frontier Gas

An energy consultant who grew up in Alaska believes the least risky way
to tap the North Slope's huge natural gas reserves is to do so in
stages, running multiple pipelines across the Canadian Arctic during the
next 16 years. 

Ron Oligney, director of engineering research development at the
University of Houston, said Tuesday that smaller pipelines built every
few years would reduce the huge costs and risks that would come with a
single, larger pipeline to the Lower 48. 

He and colleague Jim Longbottom of the University of Houston recently
completed a study on Alaska and northwest Canada gas development. The
university and private clients paid for the study, he said. On Tuesday,
Oligney presented the findings to members of the Society of Petroleum
Engineers and the International Association of Energy Economics at the
Atwood Building in downtown Anchorage.

Today's business is all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather
derivatives has become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging at
utilities, airlines, and agriculture have at hand to off-set risks
associated with temperature and precipitation.  With over 70% of Europe's
companies facing weather-related risk, knowing about the latest advances in
weather trading is a necessity.

Eyeforenergy's latest event will be run in conjunction with our European
online trading conference, Energy Trading in the New Economy, and
Eyeforenergy's Emissions Trading 2002 event, so you can learn about the
latest developments in energy and emissions trading all under one roof.

* The Business of Fuel Cells for Transportation
  Dearborn Hotel, Detroit, Michigan
  April 30 - May 1, 2002

As manufacturers are increasingly developing technologies with the energy
industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

        Summary of July 22, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   Before I forget it, my beautiful bride wants to know if one of you
is responsible for the bird feeder that appeared hanging in one of the
trees in our front yard. I'm honoring her request to inquire.

   Also, I was not going to do this but I've had several requests for
the text of the sermon I gave Sunday at St. Paul's. My reluctance in
doing this is that sermons, unlike the talks I give in our regular
Ordinary Life gathering, are meant to be heard and not read. Sermons
are set in a particular liturgical setting and use a language unique to
that context. Nonetheless, I'm posting it below. If you don't care for
sermons or don't like being ""preached to,"" just delete it.

Stay well,


Bill Kerley

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

     THE BEST NEWS YOU EVER HEARD

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   I am so glad you are here today. I've been thinking about you all
week. Actually, longer than that. I was hoping you would be here
because I have something to say just to you.
Before I tell you want it is, let me tell you what I'm shooting for in
this sermon. I want you leave here today saying, ""That's the best news
I've ever heard."" Not only that, I want you leave here with an ability
to see the world in a new way. So that you can infect others with this
good news.

   Don't misunderstand. I don't want you to leave here feeling smug
because your prejudices have been confirmed. I want it to be because a
transformation of values and beliefs takes place here so that you can
leave this place to lead a new life.

   You know as well as I do that so many people don't live life at all.
They just exist. Getting by from day to day. Some people have trouble
just seeing what is.

   Friends of mine became deeply concerned when their daughter, a
straight-A student and who had never offered them a minute of serious
difficulty, showed up to introduce her new boy friend. His hair was at
least four different vivid colors, he had tattoos over all exposed
places on his body, and so many pieces of metal piercing his body that
the father wondered, ""How does this guy get through a metal detector at
the airport?""

   The parents endured this encounter and when it was over began to try
to reason with their daughter that perhaps this young man was not the
best choice for a boyfriend. When they said things that implied they
questioned his character, the daughter assured them that he was of the
highest moral sort. ""Really?"" said the parents. ""How can you be so sure
of that?"" The daughter said, ""Well, if he weren't, why would he be
doing 500 hours of community service?""

   Some people can't see what is. Plus, we can talk ourselves into
almost anything we want. I've come to see that very often we do not so
much love the truth as we make true what we love.

   Learning to live the life God wants for us is determined by what we
say ""yes"" to and what we say ""no"" to. In the gospel text for today
Martha is described as being distracted. As one translation has it,
""She is concerned about all she has to do."" Jesus in commenting on
Mary's choice to spend time with him, talking and learning, Jesus says,
and this is my translation, ""Martha, you worry and fuss about a lot of
things, but only a few things are necessary, really only one and that
part that Mary has chosen is the most important of all and you must not
tear her away from it.""

   Mary has learned what to say ""yes"" to. That is the secret of life.
It is not easy to do. Being able to do it is both a gift of grace and
extremely hard work. But it is what makes the difference between living
and existing. Our lives, your life, is shaped by what you say ""yes"" to.

   Outside the walls of a place like this, there is almost no place or
activity that encourages us to say ""yes"" to real life. We are
encouraged at every turn to believe that our happiness is in what we
have or what we do. And though this process never really satisfies, we
are reluctant to give up on it.

   The two chief forces of consumer marketing are desire and fear. ""Eat
this, drink this, do this, drive this, and you will be happy. If you
don't, you won't. Take this pill and avoid pain. Don't take it and
suffer."" The spiritual teachings of the world, however, clearly say
that desire and fear are our two biggest barriers to a truly happy
life.

   One of the things saying ""yes"" to life means is to see life as a
demand. That's a problem for us because most of us have grown up buying
into the notion that no one should make demands on us. We want to be
free. One of our mottoes is: ""Don't you dare tell me what to do!""

   But, make no mistake about it, life is demand. The demand is that
you must choose your own life. No one else can do that for you. Not if
your living is to be satisfying and significant. That's work you have
to do.

   Most of us live life as if it were a trial run for a second chance;
ambling along, meaning to do many things, yet somehow never quite
getting around to most of them. And all too suddenly life is gone.

   There is no time for trial runs in life. Whatever is important in
life should be firmly grasped now. Whatever is to be done should
receive our best. Whatever dreams we have should be pursued. Whatever
joy and beauty we find should be shared and savored. If misfortune
finds us, as it surely will, it should be conquered quickly, lest
precious days for living be lost forever. Life is fragile and should be
handled with care and prayer.

   Martha got distracted doing what she thought was important. Now
there is a certain truth in Martha's position. Jesus was coming for
dinner. I saw a line once somewhere that said, ""If you are expecting
God for breakfast, you don't burn the toast."" Certainly we must ""do"" in
life. But Martha's doing had distracted and worried her so much that
she couldn't enjoy the party.

   My word, is that true for our culture!

   This pace of life sneaks up on us and we get seduced into thinking
that just because it's possible, we need to be doing it; that if we
don't get with what everyone else is doing, we'll be left behind.
Consequently we have created and live in a culture where you have 15
phone numbers to reach your family of three. You chat several times a
day with a stranger from South Africa, but you haven't spoken to your
next door neighbor yet this year. Leaving the house without your cell
phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 years of your life, is
a cause for panic and turning around to get it. Cleaning up the dining
room means getting the fast food bags out of the back seat of your car.

   Most of us, like Martha, feel hard pressed to deal with the hundreds
of things that compete for our attention daily. Nearly every minute of
our daily life revolves around job and mortgage, bills and debts,
personal ambitions and family problems, with an occasional expensive,
exhausting vacation thrown in for diversion. That's what we call the
""good life."" We have come to think that we have no alternatives. What
used to be called the fast lane has taken over our whole highway. But a
spiritual fact is that if we do not make the choice that Mary did, if
we do not touch the sacred, we will have done nothing.

   That wonderful passage in the Old Testament that I'll bet all of you
are familiar with doesn't say, ""Be loving and know that I am God,"" or
""Be obedient and know that I am God."" It says, ""Be still and know that
I am God.""

   The hectic pace at which we try to live is not, of course, the kind
of demand I'm talking about. We don't have life because of what we do.
When, like Mary, we choose the one thing needful, and become quiet and
still at his feet, we find ourselves doing all sorts of things. Not in
order to have life but because we see the wondrous love we have been
given and we can't stay still about it.

   Let me tell you something and, I hope, you hear this as the best
news you ever heard: You don't have to earn the right to be here. You
don't have to prove your worth. You are born worthy. You don't have to
compete for a place in life. There's already a place for you. You don't
have to go somewhere else to live. The opportunity for abundant life
surrounds you where you are. You don't have to bargain with God or
plead with God or manipulate God to get God's favor or attention.
You've already got both of these things. Here is some solid Wesleyan
Methodist theology: In Jesus Christ God has already said a loud, clear
""yes"" to you.

   It took me years to get this message and I can still fall off the
path about it. Somewhere along the line I bought the message that my
worth depended on what I did. If I did an inadequate job at something,
it meant that I was inadequate. If I failed at something, I was a
failure. If I did a bad thing, I was bad.

   I'm not meaning to be hard on myself or others. It's so easy to get
this message growing up. A child goes to a parent and says, ""What
should I wear to the party tonight?"" The parent says, ""Wear whatever
you like."" Soon the child emerges dressed for the party and says, ""How
to do you like this?"" ""No, no, honey!"" the parent says, ""Stripes and
polka dots don't go together. Go back and change either the shirt or
the slacks."" One week later the child says, ""What should I wear to the
party tonight?"" ""I've told you over and over, wear whatever you like.
Why do you always ask me?"" Why indeed.

   You might as well face up to this: There is nothing you can do,
learn or buy that can make it possible for you to escape disapproval.
If you are living that way, you are living hopelessly, burying chunks
of yourself every day. If you can see, right now, how worthy and
wonderful you are, you'll not be depressed when approval is withheld as
it surely will be. Disappointed maybe, but not depressed.

   There is a demand in life, never mistake it. That demand comes as a
result of our seeing how loved and accepted we are.

   When his followers went to him and asked, ""Lord, how will people
know that we belong to you?"" his answer was simple and significant. He
didn't say, ""People will know you are mine by what you believe about
the Bible, or the virgin birth or the resurrection."" Or any to the
other doctrinal matters Christians have their silly disputes over. What
he said was, ""People will know that you are mine by the way you love
one another."" That's the demand. And we live it joyfully because we've
heard the best news ever in his saying, ""You belong to me.""

   Not only is life promise and demand. Life is also freedom and
responsibility. Again, it is easy for us to hear only one part of this,
the part about freedom.

   Lord do we ever want to be free. Free to do our own thing. If there
is one thing that can make us bristle it is someone else trying to tell
us what to do.

   But, folks, freedom without responsibility is an illusion, a joke, a
fraud. Freedom to do what you want when you want is not freedom, it's
licence.

   Authentic freedom in our theology is the power to become what you
can become. To be free, really free, is to be responsible; that is, to
have the ability to respond to life in such a way as to move toward
God's intention for your life. That's freedom.

   I love this church. I love so much about it. The freedom, the
acceptance I've felt from the first. The way it looks and feels. The
people. This church is made up of such wonderful people. Well, except
for two or three. And, you know who you are.

   We have the freedom to be church. I've been part of this community
of faith for sixteen or seventeen years now. And almost from the
beginning I've been tempted to sneak in here at night and change the
wording on these signs you see up here. They say, ""Enter to Worship""
and ""Depart to Serve."" I think that's backwards. Real church is made
possible when we all understand that we ""Enter to Serve"" and ""Depart to
Worship."" Sure, there are times when, out of our need, we come here to
be taken care of in some way. But if we all did that all the time,
there would be no church at all. I think one of the things that makes
it sometimes so difficult to take in the good news is that we have
closed ourselves to serving, to giving, to contributing.

   All throughout my ministry I've heard people be critical of the
church and, God knows, a lot of that criticism we deserve. I wonder
what the Jesus I know would say about a lot of the stuff we say and do.
I wonder if he wouldn't look at some of our beliefs and behaviors,
scratch his head and say, ""That's not what I had in mind at all.""

   Be that as it may, this church will be the kind of church for you
that you want to the precise degree to which you exercise your freedom
to be responsible for seeing to it that we are the kind of church you
want.

   To the degree that church happens here, when we leave this place we
are to take our sense of joy and confidence into the world with us. We
are to get new eyes in here so that we can see God at work in the
world. This is true worship and the test of our rituals here - that we
live with reference to a transcendent reality out there whether we feel
like it or not. That we don't go unconscious and drift into life as
usual.

   In the Gospel selection Jesus says that Mary chose the better part,
that she had hold of something that could not be taken from her. I know
you and me well enough to know that that is our heart's desire - to
choose that which cannot be taken from us. I also know that we so often
look in the wrong places for it. Mary chose to be present to Jesus.
That's the trick. To be here, to be present. We get so distracted like
Martha, planning for the big someday, that we miss the fact that the
future we have been hoping for is right here, right now.

   This is the only day you have to do your living.

   Now, don't mishear that. To live with no eye on the future is to
live with no meaning in the present. Life that is real and lasting
comes from giving yourself to something lasting. That's what Mary
chose.

   Our critical task, it seems to me, is to learn the difference
between filling up a day and fulfilling a day. Until we have learned to
live for something other than ""me now,"" we have not learned to live for
today or tomorrow. That kind of living comes - listen carefully, I'm
going to give you the definition of eternal life - that kind of living
comes when we learn to penetrate our past with sacred memories, when we
learn to accept the future with hopeful expectancy, when we learn to
saturate our present with an acceptance of ourselves and each other as
people created in the image of God. In that is eternal life. And that
this kind of living is available to you and me, that it is possible for
you and me, is the best news you could possibly ever hear.

   I want you to hear the Good News, best news you ever heard: That no
matter how far you may think you are away from it; or, on the other
hand, how smugly you may think you don't need it, God loves you exactly
the way you are. I cannot think of better news than that.

   Now, go live it. Let this news transform you so that you begin to
see the world in an entirely different way.

   What might that look like?

   Frederick Buechner says that when you get to the heart of all good
theology, all you are left with is a story. Stories like: ""A man was
journeying from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves. Who do you
think was neighbor to him?"" Stories like, ""A certain man had two sons
and one demanded his inheritance."" Stories like, ""He entered a certain
home where a woman named Martha welcomed him."" So, let me tell you a
story.

   Years ago in the world of professional golf, before Tiger Woods
transformed the game, the sport was very different. Didn't get a lot of
publicity. Prizes weren't very big. Golfers usually drove themselves
from tournament to tournament. The tournaments themselves weren't
played for television audiences with big corporate sponsors but for
local communities and the country clubs. The purses were, of course,
considerably smaller.

   A golfer from Australia won a tournament at a club in Georgia. His
purse was something like $1500. As he was leaving, after the closing
ceremonies and visiting with the others, he went to get in his car. A
woman who had been in the gallery confronted him in the parking lot
begging for his help. She had come to that part of the country
following her golfer husband. Even though he was alcoholic and abusive,
she hoped to make her marriage work. Not only had it not but now she
was on her on, away from home. No family. No support. Even worse, her
baby was very sick, in need of medical help. She had no resources. She
was desperate.

   Her story was so touching to the golfer that he simply endorsed his
winning check over to her. That's doing.

   The next year he returned for the same tournament. The pro at that
golf club, knowing what had happened last year, decided to tell the man
from Australia that the woman was a con artist. She had, in reality,
bilked him out of those winnings.

   The golfer was stunned at this news. He then responded,
   ""You mean that woman lied to me?""
   ""Yes.""
   ""You mean to tell me that I was tricked?""
   ""Yes.""
   ""You mean to tell me that there is no sick baby?""
   ""That's right.""
   ""That's the best news I ever heard.""

   That's what I want. For you to get the best news you ever heard here
- about yourself, about the way life is, so that you and I and you and
I together can go out there and live lives where we see the world and
ourselves and each other in the way he wants us to see. That we see
ourselves and each other in the way he sees us. That we see the world
in the way he wants us to. That we see in a way that would cause him to
say about us, ""You have chosen the one thing that really matters.""

   I am so glad you've been here today. I've been thinking about you
all week. Actually, longer than that. I was hoping you would be here
because I had something to say just to you. Now I've said it. I hope
you've heard it as the best news you ever heard.

"RE: TW 637 Meeting","Don't worry, nothing's in the crack!  =)

We met and MKM, Glen, Rob & Teb were all there (among others).  We discussed that we might want to change some of our balancing provisions as filed.  Glen has set-up a meeting for Wed, Sept 5 to discuss the imbalance stuff with Ramona, Gas Logistics etc.  I can cover it and get the TW Comm Group's input as needed.  (We got Lorraine's input as far as her experience with trying to implement EPFS's 637 OBA before its time.)

At this time, I don't think we plan on meeting with customers unless a technical conference is held.  I'll keep you updated.

Subject:	TW 637 Meeting

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	""On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000.""

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

Storage_Link.  There is no longer a necessity to maintain compatibility
between Storage_Status and Storage_Plan
*	Send E-Mail on run completion:  a new option:  when GPCM has
finished a run (even as part of a batch), an e-mail is sent to the
e-mail address you specify
 
Enhancements in 9.0.8, 9.0.8.1 and 9.0.8.2 released earlier included:
*	Build New Pipeline Models and Model Changes More Easily
*	Greater Flexibility in Creating New Supply and Demand Scenarios
*	Major Upgrade to Flow Constraints Report

"FERC Limits Access to Pipeline Maps","Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term.
FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps 
Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. 
In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would ""no longer make available to the public"" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. 
Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to ""respond timely to legitimate requests"" for such documents. 
The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Given the anthrax scares on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, a spokeswoman said the Commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages.

Arctic Drilling Affected by Lower Natural Gas Prices
 
     The drilling industry ready for an active winter season on the 
tundra of Canada's far north, but low natural gas prices and a weak 
economy have lowered expectations of a boom time. Most companies such 
as Petro-Canada and Paramount Resources  are pressing ahead with 
exploration in the rugged Northwest Territories. Due to marshy 
conditions for the rest of the year, wells are drilled in winter when 
the ground freezes. Petro-Canada plans to drill three 9,840-foot deep 
wells in the Mackenzie Delta and Paramount intends to drill two wells 
farther south, near Fort Liard, below the Arctic Circle. The region 
could hold trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. In recent 
federally supervised land sales, producers committed to spending 
C$650 million on exploration over the next few years just in the 
Mackenzie Delta. But some wells in theYukon and the Northwest 
Territories' central Mackenzie Valley have been canceled or delayed 
by Canadian Natural Resources. But the troubled economy and the drop 
in prices from $10 per MMBtu last January are having an impact. Akita 
Drilling is keeping two new rigs in Alberta this winter and delaying 
the move of the C$18 million units to the Mackenzie Delta until later 
in 2002. Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Conoco are studying building 
a C$3 billion pipeline to transport about a Bcf per day of Arctic 
volumes to southern Canada and the US.

Crude Oil Futures Tumble on API Data

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled 
$1.07 to $20.18 per barrel yesterday after the API reported an 
unexpectedlarge jump of 930,000 barrels in heating oil supplies by 
last week. Analysts had expected a drop in inventories after last 
weeks cold snap increased demand. Heating oil inventories now stand 
at 62 million barrels, about 30% higher than a year ago and 10% over 
levels at the start of the heating season. Total distillate stocks 
climbed by 5.68 million barrels according the API report. Demand for 
jet fuel plunged after the September 11th attacks, so refiners began 
to produce more heating oil to make up for the shortage, but an 
unseasonably mild autumn coupled with a recession that eroded demand 
has sent inventory levels soaring. In addition, traders are skeptical 
about the level of resolve by OPEC and non-member producers to stick, 
or even come close, to their pledge to remove almost 2 million bpd 
from the market. Heating oil futures for February delivery on the 
NYMEX fell $0.0303 to $0.5379 per gallon. Prices for heating oil are 
down 8.2% for the week and 33% below a year ago. February gasoline 
futures on the NYMEX lost $0.0293 to $0.5806 per gallon. In London, 
Brent crude oil futures on the IPE were down $1.13 to $20.89 per 
barrel.

Williams Completes Cryogenic Upgrade 

  Williams has completed the addition of a 3rd cryogenic gas 
processing unit at its Echo Springs natural gas plant near Wamsutter, 
Wyoming. The project boosts processing capacity from 250 MMcf per day 
to 390 MMcf per day and liquids extraction from 18,000 bpd to 28,000 
bpd. Williams also expanded the pipeline gathering system that brings 
natural gas into the plant for processing.  Capacity on the gathering 
system was increased from 330 MMcf per day to 400 MMcf per 
day.  Total cost for the entire upgrade at the Echo Springs complex 
is $45 million. Installation of the new cryogenic unit began in April 
2001 and was mechanically completed in early November by Pro-Quip 
Corporation of Tulsa. Williams concluded startup operations in late 
December and is already utilizing in excess of 80% of the new 
processing capacity.

Lower Refining Margins Cut Into Sunoco Earnings

    Sunoco has said its operating income last year was about the same 
as in 2000 at $5.00 per share, below forecasts of $5.21 because of 
lower refining margins and a loss from its chemical business. 
Analysts expect the company to post earnings of $0.41 per share for 
the 4th quarter. Sunoco said that last quarter was the most difficult 
market environment experienced in several years because of the 
weakening economy and record warm temperatures. Northeast refining 
margins fell last quarter and its chemicals unit probably had a small 
loss because of cyclically low margins, the company said. A sharp 
drop in demand for heating oil during the 4th quarter, a time when 
refineries usually switch to producing more heating oil, has eaten 
away at profits. Last quarter, the average price of NYMEX heating oil 
fell 41% to $0.5807 per gallon from a year earlier. The company's jet 
fuel sales also likely fell victim to flight cutbacks by airlines 
following the September 11th attacks. The average price of jet fuel 
on the East Coast dropped by 44% last quarter from a year earlier. 
Sunoco said its capital spending will be about $517 million this 
year, compared to 2001s capital expenditures of about $350 million, 
excluding some acquisitions. The company plans to open about 50 new 
gasoline stations at Wal-Mart stores this year. Wal-Mart also has 
service station agreements with Murphy Oil and Tesoro Petroleum. 
Sunoco repurchased about 3.2 million shares last quarter for $120 
million. It spent a total of $393 million to buy back about 10.7 
million shares in 2001.

Shell Discovers New Gabon Oil Field


    Royal-Dutch Shell's unit in Gabon has found an onshore oilfield 
at a time the central African nation is trying to step up efforts to 
reverse a long term decline in production. Gabon's energy minister 
says the production capacity of the new field is estimated to be 
between 15,000 ? 20,000 bpd, and to hold 20 - 50 million barrels of 
crude oil. The field was discovered through the Toucan-1 exploration 
well at a depth of 5,170 feet, 6 miles from the Shell's Rabi-Kounga 
field, which is Gabon's largest. Gabon is sub-Saharan Africa's 3rd 
largest producer after Nigeria and Angola. The government relies on 
oil exports for more than 60% of its revenue.

TEPPCO Buys Chaparral and Quanah Pipelines
  
    TEPPCO has signed an agreement to acquire the Chaparral and 
Quanah pipelines from Diamond-Koch for about $130 million and is 
expects to close the deal next month. TEPPCO projects 1st year 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from 
the pipeline systems of about $16 million. All of the pipelines 
revenue is either tariff or fee-based. TEPPCO says the acquisition 
will be immediately accretive to income and cash flow. Over the last 
2 years TEPPCO has announced more than $900 million in acquisitions, 
and plans acquisitions of $300 million to $400 million in 2002. The 
800-mile Chaparral pipeline extends from New Mexico to Mont Belvieu, 
TX. The pipeline delivers natural gas liquids to fractionators and 
existing TEPPCO storage in Mont Belvieu. The 170-mile Quanah Pipeline 
is a NGL gathering system in West Texas. The Quanah Pipeline begins 
in Sutton County, TX, and connects to the Chaparral Pipeline near 
Midland. The pipelines are connected to 27 gas plants in West Texas 
and have about 28,000 HP of pumping capacity at 14 stations. The sale 
also includes 2 underground NGL storage wells with a total capacity 
of 220,000 barrels. The pipelines and facilities will be operated and 
managed by Duke Energy Field Services. The acquisition will initially 
be funded under TEPPCO's bank credit facilities. TEPPCO is evaluating 
permanent financing alternatives.

NCNG to Participate in EPA Methane-Reduction Program
  
    NCNG has said that it will participate in the EPA's Natural Gas 
STAR Program, aimed at reducing emissions of methane. Natural Gas 
STAR, a voluntary program between the EPA and the industry, seeks to 
reduce methane emissions by promoting cost-effective technologies and 
practices. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is 
considered to be a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. 
Although less than 2% of natural gas in the US is lost through 
emissions, Natural Gas STAR partners have eliminated more than 120 
Bcf of methane emissions since the program began, equal to removing 
9.5 million cars from the road for one year or planting 14.5 million 
acres of trees. In addition, companies have saved $360 million 
because of the smaller amounts of lost natural gas. Launched in 1993 
as part of the Climate Change Action Plan, Natural Gas STAR has more 
than 80 partner companies and is endorsed by 11 major industry trade 
associations. For more information about the EPA's Natural Gas STAR 
program, visit www.epa.gov/gasstar .

Duke Begins Operations at New Natural Gas Processing Plant 


    Duke Energy Field Services has completed start-up testing 
operations at its new Platteville natural gas processing plant, and 
placed it into commercial operation. The Platteville processing plant 
is located northeast of Denver and will have an initial capacity of 
33 MMcf per day of natural gas, and is expandable to 50 MMcf per day 
with additional inlet compression. The plant will facilitate 
additional oil and gas production growth in the Denver-Julesburg  
Basin. This expansion of processing capacity represents the 3rd major 
expansion of capacity in the last three years and increases Dukes's 
processing capacity in the area to more than 240 MMcf per day.

Lindy - Could you verify if POI #57096 is still valid for any reason?

Ramona - It appears that some of these points are available for displacement.  In the new system, Linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid.  I will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template (ie, if a delivery point allows displacement, then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template.  Nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles.).

Elizabeth

Subject:	TW Contract Template Clean-up

In cleaning up some template information, the following points were found to be on no templates. 

	1. Do they belong on a template?
	2. Is the template listed the correct one?

Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.

Crude Oil Futures Dip on Demand Worries and OPEC Compliance 

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.70 
to $19.68 per barrel on Friday, slipping under $20.00 per barrel for 
the first time in nearly 2 weeks. Crude futures fell almost $2.00 
last week after both the API and EIA reported huge inventory builds 
for distillates. As mild weather in the Northeast and an economic 
recession has produced a total surplus of 88 million barrels in 
inventories, traders are concerned that production cuts made by OPEC 
and non-cartel producers will not be enough to rescue oil prices in 
the short term. Many doubt that any of the producers will actually 
stick to their self-imposed output curbs, however some may come 
closer than others. It is the degree of cheating on quotas that will 
determine the near term future of prices. If OPEC and non-OPEC 
producers can remove enough oil from the market to somewhat balance 
supply and demand, prices will likely remain stable or rise 
accordingly. Barring that event, the market will have to wait until 
an expected economic recovery in the second half of the year results 
in increased demand in order for prices to rebound significantly. The 
prospect for compliance was dimmed somewhat when Russia announced 
last week that there would be no January limits on exports of fuel 
oil. Sibneft, Russias 6th largest producer has also said it will 
increase production in 2002 by almost 6 million metric tons. Saudi 
Arabia has told customers in Europe and Asia that it has cut February 
exports by 3% - 7%. But some say that the reduction in February 
deliveries implies that compliance with January cuts could not have 
been good. Since the country usually comes closer to quota adherence 
than others in the cartel, it is unlikely that the compliance of 
others will be any better. Heating oil futures for February delivery 
on the NYMEX fell $0.0139 to $0.5394 per gallon. February gasoline 
futures on the NYMEX slid $0.0165 to $0.5731 per gallon. In London, 
Brent crude oil futures for February delivery were down $0.43 to 
$20.86 per barrel.

Oil and Natural Gas Earnings Expected to Tumble
  
    With oil and natural gas prices sharply lower than the record 
highs of a year ago, earnings for the 7 companies that comprise S&Ps 
oil and natural gas exploration and production index, and likely many 
others in the sector, are expected to tumble by about 70% or more. 
Oil prices dropped by 36% and natural gas prices by 58% from last 
year. Earnings for last quarter are also expected to be impacted by 
write-downs due to the devaluation of oil and natural gas reserves as 
a result of the lower prices. The S&P exploration and production 
index posted a 22% loss for 2001 as a whole. Earnings and stock 
prices for the sector are not expected to get much of a lift until 
the second half of 2002. Investors appear to be focused on the lack 
of cold winter weather, brimming inventories and whether OPEC 
production cuts will be sufficient to increase prices. The natural 
gas market is expected to tighten up around the middle of the year as 
supplies start to shrink from a downturn in drilling during the final 
2 quarters of last year. In the short term, investors are expected to 
focus on companies that can provide volume production growth despite 
cuts in their drilling budgets due to lower prices.

Enterprise Target of Eni Bid 

    Enterprise Oils new CEO will address analysts and investors on 
February 5th, laying out his strategy for an independent company. 
Enterprise has  rejected an unsolicited offer from Italys Eni SpA. 
However, its investors want further details of the rejected offer. 
Eni is also considering raising its bid, but hasn't commented 
publicly. Enterprise shares rose 3.6% Friday to 628p, bringing the 
gain for the past week to 28%. Enterprise which will also report 2001 
earnings February 5th. In December Enterprise boasted it could 
increase production faster than bigger rivals such as Shell and BP. 
But, it has suffered production setbacks in the past year. It said in 
September it would miss a 2001 target of 250,000 - 260,000 bpd for 
the year. The companys prior CEO retired the following month. 
Enterprise says that more than half of future growth will come from 
existing projects such as the Val d'Agri field in Italy, where Eni is 
its partner. The rest would come from expanding operations at fields 
such as Nelson, in the North Sea, from new exploration and from asset 
purchases.

Suncor Revises 4th Quarter Earnings Estimate
  
    Shares in Suncor Energy fell on Friday after the Canadian company 
said net earnings for the 4th quarter would drop as much as 75% below 
the 3rd quarter. Suncor, which has extensive oil sands mining and 
synthetic crude processing operations in northern Alberta, said a big 
part of the drop was a result of unexpectedly high costs related to 
the recent commissioning of its C$3.4-billion expansion, called 
Project Millenium. The start up costs, along with a sharply lower oil 
prices, will be the main factors in lowering net earnings into the 
C$18 million to C$22 million range, down from C$73 million in the 
previous quarter and C$111 million in the 4th quarter of 2000. The 
expansion which began operations last year, has almost doubled 
synthetic crude production from the plant to 218,000 bpd. However, 
start-up expenses for the expansion were about C$76 million in the 
4th quarter, more than double the expected C$35 million, the company 
said. Suncor did not allow for that situation when it released 
previous guidance figures in early December. Now that the 
commissioning is complete, those expenses will not be repeated, the 
company said. Total synthetic crude production in the 4th quarter was 
expected to be 153,000 bpd, down from forecasts of 155,000 to 165,000 
bpd, Suncor said. Production for this year is expected to be 225,000 
bpd.

Nigeria Fuel Strike Threatened

    The Nigerian government is in talks with the country's main labor 
in a bid to stave off a threatened strike over recent fuel price 
increases. The Nigeria Labor Congress has warned that it will embark 
on a nationwide strike scheduled to begin January 15th if the 
government does not revert to the old fuel prices. The government 
increased the price of petrol, kerosene and diesel oil by between 18-
35% sending fuel and transport prices in the West African nation 
soaring. The NLC said workers in the public and private sectors, 
including transporters, market women, petrol station attendants, 
ports and hospital workers, would participate in the strike, which 
would be the second over fuel price increases in the past 2 years. 
Negotiations between the government and the NLC opened last Thursday 
in the capital but ended without agreement. Nigeria, the world's 6th 
largest oil producer, earns more than 90% of its foreign exchange and 
government revenue from exports of the commodity.

Tankers Booked to Ship Gasoline from Europe to US 

    A large volume of tankers have been chartered in the past 10 days 
to load gasoline from the UK, Continent and Mediterranean to the US 
as the arbitrage window reopened. CSSSA has been one of the more 
active charterers from the Continent, booking at least five ships, 
while ChevronTexaco and Repsol have also been major players. From the 
Mediterranean, Agip USA booked four ships for cargoes to the Atlantic 
coast. The relatively weak freight prices following slow trade over 
the Christmas holidays made the arbitrage window viable, but rates 
are slowly creeping up on the back of this increase in activity. 
Rates should continue to head higher as this transatlantic activity 
will create a lack of supply on the Continent with 15 to 20 ships 
having been removed. Brokers said it will be a month before the ships 
are repositioned back on the Continent. It is unlikely these ships 
will try to collect cargoes from the Caribbean after discharging in 
the US as demand from this area for products on the Atlantic coast 
has waned.

Pemex to Sell Crude to Valero

    Pemex has confirmed its subsidiary, PMI Comercio Internacional,  
has signed a long-term contract to sell 90,000 bpd of Maya crude to 
Valero Energy. Pemex says that delivery would begin when Valero 
completes expansion at its refinery in Texas City. Valero says the 
new contract brought its total commitment with PMI to more than 
170,000 bpd of crude oil. Valero is adding a 45,000 bpd coker unit to 
its Texas City refinery, which will enable it to process heavier, 
high sulfur crude oil, such as the Maya crude.

Kirk,

Well, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday.  I know
that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project.
Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our
pipe.  I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but
please don't hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help
you.

Thanks for keeping me posted,

Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a ""permit"" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their ""ducks in a row"" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project
with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me
regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.
Kirk

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

"RE: SoCalGas Developments","Yes, we should take a look at it. I spoke to Blair about it this morning but we probably need to get a more in-depth analysis. Lorraine is SoCal's rep so she should probably be the one to review it as well as Kim Watson and myself. Thanks.

Subject:	RE: SoCalGas Developments

I had also received the filing and likewise Susan (Scott) Lindberg had received one.  Susan's copy has been forwarded to Blair/Teb for regulatory review as well as being available in Houston for Marketing to review.  It's a bound document about 2 inches thick including the testimony.  Importantly it includes SoCal's proposal for receipt point capacity.  I've only read the transmittal letter thus far but will continue reviewing it for more detail.  

Steve, would you want to designate someone from Marketing to review key sections?  I would offer to let them know which areas or sections of the filing could use input from Marketing before we decide whether or not to comment on SoCal's proposal or to simply intervene at this time, monitor progress and provide input later in the proceeding if necessary. 

Other comments?  gh

Subject:	WorldCom Calling Card

Caroly,

I am confirming that I have received my new WorldCom calling card.  The account number on the WorldCom card is two digits off of my ATT Calling card.  Are they supposed to be the same?

Last four digits ATT card:  9827
Last four digits WorldCom card:  9829

Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.

"GPCM News: 11/21/01: RBAC Travel Schedule: EIA Says Long Term EnergyPrices Will be Lower: TGPL Expands in Mass: FERC Won't Cede LNG Authority","RBAC Travel Schedule December
 
Bob Brooks is planning one more trip to Houston this year, during the
early part of December.  If you want to schedule time with Bob for
initial or on-going training, demonstration, or other GPCM-related
business, please contact him at 323-663-4831 or rebrooks@rbac.com .
 
EIA Says Long Term Energy Prices to Fall, even with Growth in Demand
 
Oil and gas prices will ease over the long term, even with substantial
energy demand growth to 2020.  So says the EIA in its recent Annual
Energy Report 2002.  Prices of natural gas will rise above $4.00 in
2002, but will settle down to $3.25 per mmbtu by 2020, even with demand
growth of 50% over the next 20 years.
 
For the whole story, see:
http://www.ftenergyusa.com/energyrpt/default.asp
 
Tennessee Gas to Expand in Massachusetts
 
TGPL announced an expansion of a 12 mile segment of its pipe from Dracut
to Burlington in Massachusetts, increasing capacity by 200 mmcfd.  Most
of the additional capacity is expected to be used to supply gas-fired
power plants.
 
FERC Won't Cede Authority over LNG Import Facilities
 
The FERC yesterday rejected a request by Dynegy LNG Production Terminal
to be exempt from FERC oversight of its proposed facility at Hackberry,
Louisiana.  The plant is planned to have a vaporization capacity of 750
mmcfd expandable to 1 bcfd and to be operational by 4th quarter 2003.
Hackberry is situated on the west side of Calcasieu Lake in southwest
Louisiana.  The closest interstate pipelines are Columbia Gulf and Gulf
South (formerly Koch Gateway).

Paul,

Guess that makes you the baddest bull in the pasture [now you've got to deal
with all those admiring cows].

You ought to take the kids to Dallas for indoctrination as the Longhorns win
the Big XII championship again.

We're still not walking up here, but there was some excitement when Janell
got a right shoe on [not for long].  I'm very concerned at this point about
our mini-Imelda investment in ladies footwear and the Docs lack of expressed
confidence about the swelling ever subsiding totally.  It's hell to be old
{Janell tells me}.

Oh well, at least we're not all working for bankrupt companies...

Thanx,
Dennis

Subject:	Transwestern Red Rock Expansion- FERC Extension Letter

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.

technology to deliver business value.  If you were registered for the

How Did Hyperion Help Reliant Energy Leverage their ERP and Data Warehouse
Investments?  How did Reliant Energy Address the Consolidation, Reporting,
 Analysis, Modeling, Budgeting and Forecasting Issues that existed within
                                   SAP?

 ""Delivered via a corporate Intranet portal, SPARC [Systemized Performance
                               Analysis and
    Reporting Channel] provides: forward looking, integrated financial
   statements ... a repository for variance explanation across forecast
             cycles; and a communicator of performance data.""
Commentary by David Michie, Reliant Energy

 From The Data Warehousing Institute's WHAT WORKS, Volume 11 - Case
Studies.url>>

 http://www.dw-institute.com/whatworks11/cs/cs7/cs7.html



Join us Tuesday, October 30th, 2001 at The Four Seasons Hotel to understand
how Reliant Energy has addressed the major changes in its industry so that
it now has the ability to manage the short-term and long-term business
horizons in a more deregulated world.  Reliant Energy, Arthur Andersen, and
Thinkfast Consulting will present on how Reliant Energy leveraged their ERP
and Data Warehouse investments with Hyperion to create SPARC, their
reporting, analysis, budgeting, forecasting and modeling system.

Prior to Hyperion, according to David Michie, ""...previous plan, actuals,
and one-year forecast updates came from separate source systems utilizing
different account definitions and formats, which made comparability and
consolidation  very difficult. This led to analysts re-formatting data,
adjusting links, and modifying formulas. In addition, update-to-update
changes could not be identified on a real-time basis.""


 Learn how Reliant Energy leverages Hyperion Solutions to:
? Reduce its Forecasting and Management Cycle from 8-10 days to 2-3 days
? Provide a ""single version of the truth"" for business rules with the
Hyperion Analytic Platform, which has reduced the average decision making
horizon from     indefinite (multiple internal meetings) to minutes or
hours
? Automate integration with their ERP Package
? Facilitate reporting, analysis, modeling and planning from multiple data
sources - including ERP, Data Warehouse, Legacy and others
? Eliminate manual efforts of spreadsheet shadow systems - re-formatting of
data, adjusting links, modifying formulas, etc.
? Gain an extensible solution that can be leveraged enterprise wide with
the Hyperion Analytic Platform
? Successfully deliver business value, utilizing partnerships with Arthur
Andersen and Thinkfast Consulting

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Following is the course information for Becoming an Exceptional Leader; As I thought, it begins the day after you come back from vacation.  There are (2) other offerings of this same course, same teacher.  You can log onto http:/elm.enron.com, and sign up for the one that suits your schedule.  One is offered October 31-November 2, and the other is November 19-21.  When you register, it will say there is a wait list.  However, they are in the process of adding a few more seats, so you would probably get in.

Thanks,

This program targets analytical and interpersonal problems that block productive managerial performance and is built around personal and confidential feedback provided from direct reports.  The course is based on research done over the last two decades on what differentiates high performers from their peers.  The program is practical, personal, conceptual, tactical, and focused on skill building.  Participants leave with knowledge of: (1) present style/strengths, (2) areas for improvement, (3) specific tactics or ""how-to's,"" and (4) a plan for future development.  
Target Audience: line managers/directors, team advisors, functional managers/directors, vice presidents - preferably, anyone who has at least three employees reporting to them.

"Re: Pigging San Juan","We received 2 pigs at Gallup today at 1305 MDST with a pressure of 816# and a flow rate of 800 MMCF/D.
We had about 2 gallons of black liquid in the receiver barrel. We took a sample for analysis.
The Station inlet scrubber was checked and no liquid was noted.

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX dipped briefly below $2 per MMBtu Friday, but bounced back on short-covering and funds rolling to end the day down $0.011 at $2.037 per MMBtu. The March contract gained $0.014 to $2.104 per MMBtu. The market began the session lower and gradually works its way higher most of the day, holding inside only a $0.05 range. Funds continued rolling positions into March and April contracts and beyond, and marketers braced themselves for Februarys expiration tomorrow. Although the market is making an effort to stay above $2.00, it made a lower high, a lower low and closed lower for the day and the week. So look for the market to continue down this week unless colder weather is forecast. Also expect to see an even smaller withdrawal this week from storage of about 110  120 Bcf. However, there is a chance for limited short-covering into expiration as the market continues to be oversold technically. On Friday, estimated volume wa!
s about 90,000 contracts, with about 40,000 of those spreads or hedge trades. Natural gas for weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.05  $0.15 lower Friday, Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.09 to $2.03 per MMBtu. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    Standard & Poor's is changing the way it rates companies, in part because of problems from the demise of Enron. S&P is likely to conduct more formal reviews of ratings, and will be more specific about how far a rating may fall in the event of a review for downgrade. It will also focus more on credit cliff situations, which could result in a precipitous decline in a company's ratings if certain events take place. It will require companies to publicize rating triggers, such as one that in November could have forced Enron to pay off a $690 million note because of a recent downgrade. S&P is considering how best to incorporate securities price movements into ratings. S&P rates companies on a sliding scale from AAA to D. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch are also considering changes to make their own rating activity more timely. <BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  Exelon 3rd quarter net income was 6.7% lower than reported in October because of an accounting error. Net income was $376 million, or $1.16 per share, not $403 million, or $1.25 per share. That means Exelon's 3rd quarter profit rose 62% from $232 million, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier. The company had a bigger than expected loss in a trust fund that has money for dismantling nuclear generators after they are closed. The fund is not managed by Exelon. Exelon will report 4th quarter and 2001 financial results tomorrow. It probably earned about $4.30 - $4.45 last year. </FONT><FONT  COLOR=""#000000"" BACK=""#ffffff"" style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=9 FAMILY=""FIXED"" FACE=""Courier New"" LANG=""0""><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    Former Enron Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter, who had opposed the accounting practices that led to the downfall of the energy trading giant, apparently took his own life early Friday morning. Police said that Baxter was dead at the scene and the only occupant of the car. A suicide note and a revolver were found at the scene. Baxter was chairman and CEO of Enron North America before being named chief strategy officer. In October of 2000, he was promoted to vice chairman. Baxter resigned last May after ten years with Enron, during which time he helped build its wholesale energy business. Baxter had disagreed with then CEO Jeffrey Skilling over the inappropriateness of off-balance-sheet transactions involving partnerships that ultimately brought the company down. Baxter was one of the Enron directors targeted in about 40 investor lawsuits which allege that the company concealed losses by the use of the partnerships. Baxter engineered the $3.21 billion purchase of Portlan!
d General Electric in 1997. Enron has agreed to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas for $2.98 billion in cash, stock and debt. Baxter resigned after losing a battle with Skilling for control of the direction the company would take. He favored the acquisition of energy producing assets to build the company, while Skilling preferred to expand the commodities trading unit, in Enrons asset light theory. Baxter reportedly told friends that he planned to earn a Ph.D. in history, spend time with his family and look for a position as chief executive at another company.</FONT><FONT  COLOR=""#000000"" BACK=""#ffffff"" style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY=""FIXED"" FACE=""Courier New"" LANG=""0""><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
  <BR>
    The bidding process for Enrons $2.9 billion Dabhol Power project in India is set to begin this week. The Industrial Development Bank of India said advertisements will be placed in newspapers. Interested foreign companies are Royal Dutch/Shell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France. Potential Indian buyers are BSES Ltd, Tata Power and Gas Authority of India. Reportedly Rothschild, DSP Merrill Lynch and Smifs Securities have been appointed to search for bidders. The vast 2,184 MW natural gas fired power plant and nearby LNG facility, the largest foreign private investment ever in India, has been idle since Enron pulled out last June in a dispute over the cost of the power provided to its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The 740 MW first phase of Dabhol began operating in May 1999. A 1,444 MW 2nd phase was almost complete when construction was halted after the state electricity board fell $240 million behind in payments for power provided. Those interested i!
n acquiring the plant must put up a non-refundable $100,000 in earnest money. The sellers intend to sell the plant as a whole, but bidders may bid jointly for the operation and split it up later. A London data room will be established for the commercial and financial agreements, operating and historical data, projections and information on the status of Phase II. Due diligence is expected to begin early next month, with a possible deadline of the middle of March for submitting offers. The US governments Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a lender and guarantor of  loans to the project, and IDBI have led the talks among the parties involved, including 5 Indian financial institutions, 20 foreign banks, 3 foreign government lending agencies, several governments, equity holders and potential bidders. Enron owns 65% of the Dabhol project, GE and Bechtel each own 10% and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 15%. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    The California PUC has rejected a settlement proposed by Sempra Energy that seeks to split profits from power sales between customers of San Diego Gas and Electric and shareholders. The decision will likely lead to a lawsuit between Sempra and the PUC. At stake is $363 million the PUC argues could be used to the benefit of customers by paying down a special balancing account set up during the California's energy crisis last year that captured the difference between retail prices state regulators allowed SDG&E to charge and soaring wholesale power prices. To cash in on the high prices, SDG&E sold all the electricity remaining on several 5-year power contracts it had signed in 1996 and 1997, pocketing the profit.. </FONT><FONT  COLOR=""#000000"" BACK=""#ffffff"" style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY=""FIXED"" FACE=""Courier New"" LANG=""0""><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
  <BR>
    PanCanadian Energy Will buy Alberta Energy in a $16.8 billion share exchange deal which will create North America's largest oil exploration and production company, replacing Anadarko. The deal will allow the companies to compete effectively on a global basis. The new company, which is to be headquartered in Calgary, will be named EnCana Corp. The exchange ratio is a market-to-market ratio based on the average of the closing price for the 10 trading days ended January 23rd. PanCanadian shareholders will own about 54% and AEC shareholders will own about 46% of EnCana. Combined, the stocks of the two companies make up 44% of the TSEs oil and gas sub-index. Some say that Canadian companies have realized the need to bulk up in order to be competitive with larger companies in the US, like Anadarko, Burlington Resources and Devon Energy, and to attract investors. The deal could also be a self-protection measure in response to last year's rash of takeovers of Canadian oil firms !
by US companies, like those that took over Gulf Canada, Anderson Exploration and Canadian Hunter. Alberta Energy and PanCanadian may have seen themselves as vulnerable to possible takeovers. PanCanadian had been considered a possible takeover target when it was spun off from Canadian Pacific in October. A new AEC-PanCanadian company would produce 255,000 bpd of oil and natural gas liquids and 2.5 Bcf of natural gas per day. PanCanadian has natural gas and oil production facilities in Western Canada and offshore operations in Nova Scotia, the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, where it recently discovered the areas largest oil field in 10 years, named Buzzard. AEC also produces oil and natural gas in Western Canada, owns about 14% of the Syncrude Canada oil sands project and has exploration, production, pipeline and natural gas storage units in the Rocky Mountains, Ecuador and the Arctic. </FONT><FONT  COLOR=""#001020"" BACK=""#ffffff"" style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=!

Western Frontier Project Filed with FERC
Williams has filed an application with the FERC to construct and operate
the Western Frontier Pipeline in Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma. Western
Frontier Pipeline, a unit of Williams, plans to construct a $365
million, 400-mile, 30-inch pipeline and 30,000 horsepower of compression
designed to transport up to 540,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day to
markets in the mid-continent. The pipeline would extend from the
Cheyenne Hub in northeastern Colorado to Williams' Central pipeline
system and various other pipeline interconnects in southwest Kansas and
the panhandle of Oklahoma. In addition to interconnection with the
Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other ANR Pipeline,
Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas
Pipeline of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the
Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Central system. The pipeline is
anticipated to be in service in late 2003.

"GPCM News: 1/22/02: Bob Brooks in Boston: Southwest Gas Fix in New Database","Bob Brooks in Boston

 

Bob Brooks is in Boston for a couple of days working with Charles River
Associates on the NYSERDA study of the gas network of New York.  If you
need to reach him, his cell phone number is 323-821-9075.

 

Southwest Gas Data Fix

 

One of our users has correctly pointed out that there is a small bug in
the Location table of recent GPCMdat databases, which could cause some
confusion in some reports.

 

The bug was introduced when the Southwest Gas pipeline model was split
into two zones:  north and south.  In the location table Zone ZN194
became ZN194-N and ZN194-S.  Unfortunately, the Zone name ""Southwest Gas
Corp."" did not get the North and South appendages.  

 

So, the fix is really easy:  from Case Definition click the Data button
then the Location button.  Select Type ""Trans"" and then browse down to
the Southwest Gas Corp. entries and change them to Southwest Gas North
and Southwest Gas South respectively.  Then your reports will also read
correctly.

 

Thanks for letting us know about this!

Crude Oil Futures Rise on Expiry


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX rose $0.34 
to $18.34 per barrel before they expired yesterday. March crude oil 
futures on the NYMEX climbed $0.32 to $18.98 per barrel. The White 
House provided a lift for the market with the announcement of a 
tender for 22,000 barrels of oil to be added to the SPR in exchange 
for royalties owed to the government. The SPR currently holds 551 
million barrels of oil, enough to supply the nation for 4 weeks. The 
reserves are located in salt caverns near the Texas and Louisiana 
coasts of the Gulf of Mexico. Comments from Iran's oil minister also 
gave the market a boost when he hinted that another production cut 
might be in the offing at the cartels March meeting. In the meantime, 
traders are closely watching for signs that the production cuts 
implemented by producers at the first of the year will actually 
reduce the volume of oil on the market. OPEC's secretary-general said 
that compliance with the production cuts would prove sufficient to 
support prices. Heating oil futures for February delivery on the 
NYMEX were flat, remaining at $0.5141 per gallon, as the market took 
a wait and see stance ahead of weekly inventory data. News of 265,000 
bpd, or 18%, in run cuts at Valero's 12 US refineries, mainly due to 
poor refining margins, gave a lift to gasoline futures. Valero also 
plans to cut an additional 425,000 bpd, or 28% of its total US 
production, in February for planned maintenance and economic reasons. 
February gasoline futures on the NYMEX gained $0.0087 to $0.5479 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the 
IPE were up $0.18 to $18.75 per barrel.

           World Heating Fuel Outlook                     
 
    Mild temperatures in Europe, southern Canada and the eastern US 
will stifle heating oil usage through the end of January. In the 
northern hemisphere, only China and Japan are likely to experience 
generally colder than usual weather. In the US, mild temperatures 
will continue across the central and eastern sections over the next 7 
to 10 days, adding to the lack of seasonal demand for heating oil. 
Occasional spells of colder weather will occur, but the general trend 
of unusually mild weather is expected to continue into next month. 
Temperatures will average from 4? to 9? F above normal through 
February 1st in the Midwest, Northeast and most of the Southeast. 
Cold temperatures could occur in areas west of the Rocky Mountains 
during the next 10 days, raising the demand for heating fuel. 
Temperatures will be about 4? F below normal along the Pacific Coast 
and nearly 10? below average in the interior western states. In 
Canada, cold air will continue to spread across northern and western 
Canada but will likely not move southward during the next several 
days, reducing heating demand in southern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec 
and the Atlantic Provinces with temperatures averaging from 2? - 8? C 
above normal through the end of the month. Cold temperatures and 
strong heating fuel demand will occur in British Columbia, western 
Alberta and northern parts of Canada for the next 10 days. In Europe, 
wide-spread pleasant weather is expected for the next few days, 
keeping demand for heating fuel lower than average. Temperatures from 
3? - 7? C above normal will affect most mainland European regions and 
the UK through early next month. Cold temperatures will prevail in 
the Scandinavian countries for the next several days, maintaining 
strong heating needs.

Teppco 4th Quarter Earnings Down 
  
    Teppco Partners says 4th quarter net income fell 7%, but full-
year earnings jumped 40% on strong performance of its upstream and 
downstream units, contributions from Jonah Gas Gathering System 
acquisition and increased distribution. Teppco reported net income of 
$21.2 million, or $0.40 per unit, compared with $22.8 million, or 
$0.53 per unit in a year ago. Full-year 2001 earnings climbed to 
$109.1 million, or $2.18 per unit, from $77.4 million, or $1.89 per 
unit in 2000. The company's net income, adjusted for the $19 million 
Pennzoil settlement, was still over $90 million, exceeding the 
previous best year by $13 million, with earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $229 million. Teppco faces 
uncertainties regarding the economy, refined products demand and 
crude oil pricing.

BP Hit With 1 Million Pounds in Fines


    After having fines totaling 1 million pounds levied against it, 
BP said its reputation on safety and pollution issues had been 
compromised by 2 incidents spanning 3 days at its Grangemouth, 
Scotland oil and petrochemicals complex. A Scottish court found BP 
guilty of gross dereliction of duties and ruled that there had been 
considerable danger to plant operators and members of the public. 
BP's chemicals operation has been fined 750,000 pounds for failure to 
ensure the safety of the public after a pipeline rupture at the 
complex. A further 250,000 pound fine was imposed on BP Grangemouth 
for failure to ensure the safety of employees during a fire at the 
refinery's catalytic cracking unit just 3 days after the first 
incident when flammable hydrocarbon vapors exploded, causing 5 BP 
employees to flee for their lives. BP said that it is in the midst of 
a 3-year 240 million pound upgrade to the safety infrastructure at 
the huge Grangemouth facility, which refines crude oil from the North 
Sea and manufactures bulk petrochemicals and plastics. To repair 
damage to its reputation, the oil firm has heightened its public 
relations within the local community and carefully explains what its 
doing and why its doing it in relation to the ongoing improvements.

Petro-Canada Profit Falls Sharply

  
    Petro-Canada's 4th quarter profit tumbled 75% as lower oil and 
natural gas prices and exposure to Enron took their toll. Petro-
Canada is in a long list of major oil companies in North America 
whose profits were squeezed by worsening industry conditions as the 
world economy weakened. Quarterly net earnings were C$71 million, or 
C$0.27 per share, down from C$287 million, or C$1.05 per share, 
before reorganization costs in 2000. Profit was lowered by C$15 
million, or C$0.06 per share, after Petro-Canada severed its natural 
gas trading ties with Enron. Cash flow was more than cut in half to 
C$307 million, or C$1.17 a share, from C$684 million, or C$2.52 per 
share. Revenues were C$1.8 billion, down 39% from C$2.9 billion. 
Petro-Canada does not expect sharply higher prices this year, even 
though its capital spending is expected to increase 9% this year to 
more than C$1.8 billion. Earnings at the company's exploration and 
production division sank 79% in the quarter to C$52 million, due to 
sharply weaker oil prices and lower production after non-core asset 
sales during 2001. Petro-Canada sold its crude oil for an average 
C$29.32 per barrel in the quarter, down 36% from the year before, 
while the price it received for its natural gas averaged C$3.17 per 
Mcf, down 57%. Total oil and natural gas production averaged 205,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from year-earlier 211,000.

Schlumbergers Profits Dip 22% 


    Schlumberger's net income dropped by 22% in the 4th quarter due 
to a decline in drilling activity. Profit for the last quarter was 
$185 million, or $0.32 per share, down from about $238 million, or 
$0.41 per share a year ago. Analysts had forecast earnings of $0.33 
per share. Revenue for 2001 was up 27% to $3.63 billion. The number 
of Schlumberger's rigs in use world-wide in the 4th quarter dropped 
by 8% from a year ago and 13% from the 3rd quarter. The company's tax 
payment climbed from $82.7 million a year ago to $219 million last 
quarter after it divested a water-meter business. Schlumberger said 
its 2002 business depends heavily on the timing and strength of the 
economic recovery in North America. The company cut its debt to about 
$5 billion last quarter from $5.7 billion the previous quarter and it 
obtained an additional $4.6 billion credit line last quarter. The 
company has retained its investment grade rating with both Moody's 
and S&P.

Fire at Chevron Refinery Does Little Damage

    A fire late Sunday in a hydrotreating unit at the ChevronTexaco 
refinery in El Segundo, California, near Los Angeles, was quickly 
extinguished and other refinery units were not affected. The 
hydrotreating unit was due to have been brought down soon for 
scheduled maintenance work and because of the fire the work can now 
be carried out a little quicker.

Pennzoil Introduces New High Mileage Vehicle Motor Oil

    Pennzoil has introduced a new product specifically for high 
mileage vehicles: Pennzoil High Mileage Vehicle formula. Providing 
maximum protection for vehicles with odometer readings of 75,000 
miles and beyond, Pennzoil High Mileage Vehicle motor oil helps 
prevent most of the common problems associated with older engines. 
These problems include cracked seals that cause leaks to form into 
deposits, robbing an engine of horsepower. In your engine, these 
deposits can cause piston rings to stick, allowing combustion gases 
to contaminate the oil, resulting in thicker oil. Pennzoil's new 
formula was developed with additional components to help prevent 
these types of engine problems. Pennzoil's unique formula features an 
additive that interacts with the rubber in engine seals causing them 
to swell and preventing them from getting hard and cracked, ensuring 
better seal-to-seal metal contact, helping to prevent leaks and to 
reduce oil consumption.

TGP's Dracut Expansion Receives FERC Approval

  

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has accepted the FERC's certificate 

authorizing construction of the Dracut Expansion project. The $35 

million project will replace 12 miles of existing 16-inch natural gas 

pipeline with a 24-inch pipeline from Dracut to Burlington, 

Massachusetts, primarily using existing rights-of-way.  The project 

will increase takeaway capacity from the Dracut interconnect by an 

additional 200,000 MMBtu per day.  Once the project is in service, 

the total capacity from Dracut will increase to more than 600,000 

MMBtu per day.  The project is scheduled to be available for service 

next fall. Tennessee initiated the growth by completing the Eastern 

Express 2000 project in January, 2000 and placed the Londonderry 

pipeline in service in September, 2001.

Subject:	ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management - Organizational Changes

The purpose of this memo is to inform you of organizational changes for ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.

=> NEWS AND NOTES

THE NEW WORLD OF COMMUNICATIONS

The world really did change on September 11.  Think of 
it:  Try to remember something you did during the first 
week of September -- a party, a movie, a dinner out.  
Doesn't that seem like a lifetime ago?

At a recent seminar I gave to a group of young members of 
the International Association of Business Communicators, 
I was asked, ""How has communications changed since 
September 11?""  I think that there are two important 
shifts:  

1) All communications now must be relevant.  The era of 
cranking out meaningless press releases on top of fluffy 
brochures followed by disjointed ads is past.  I have 
been as guilty as the next person.  But here on out, 
irrelevant blather is not going to be tolerated by target 
audiences.  The example I use is the ubiquitous ""new 
senior vice president"" press release.  In the past, 
journalists (and the public) could dismiss these without 
a second thought.  Today, the recipient is just as likely 
to wonder, ""Why is this company bothering to waste 
precious resources on this?""  (If the press release 
describes a newsworthy shift in the marketplace, and 
articulates how this new senior VP address that shift in 
a way that benefits the company's customers, then that is 
a step in the right direction.) 

2) Communications that are sensitive to ""balance"" are 
more likely to resonate.  Even if a communication is 
relevant, if it has an underlying message that some 
gadget or feature is incredibly important, it will fall 
on deaf ears.  What's important today?  Balance in life.  
Family.  Friends.  Even dogs <grin>!  For example, if you 
can demonstrate that your product or service can give 
your customer more time to spend on precious moments with 
their family, you are better off than if you highlight 
the 24x7 availability that allows people to work all the 
time...

EVALUATING CONSULTANTS

Brookwoods Group is a member of the Technology 
Entrepreneurs Exchange (www.texchange.org), and I 
attended the meeting last week as a panel of experts 
discussed the critical success factors for building a 
successful business. 

Bill Nash, president of Holland & Davis management 
consultants (www.hdinc.com) was one of the panelists, and 
I scribbled some notes from his talk, including a 
paraphrase of his four tough questions that should be 
asked of any consulting firm you are considering:

1)  Have you ever been fired by a client,
    and if so, why?

2)  Have you ever turned down a client
    opportunity, and if so, why?

3)  For your client's sake, have you ever
    removed yourself from a project, and
    if so, why?

4)  For your own sake, have you ever 
    fired a client, and if so, why?

=========================================================

=> INTERESTING INTERNET

This month marks the 75th anniversary of Winnie-the-Pooh.  
I think it may have been George Carlin who asked, ""What 
is a Pooh?""  For those of us with a taste for unusual 
trivia, the name Winnie-the-Pooh was given by a real boy, 
Christopher Robin, to his stuffed teddy bear that had 
been previously called Edward Bear.  Five-year-old 
Christopher didn't really like the name, so his father, 
A.J. Milne, encouraged him to make up a new name.  The 
boy immediately came up with ""Winnie-the-Pooh,"" a 
combination of the name of a friendly bear he had met at 
the London Zoo named Winnie (after the city of Winnipeg) 
and the name of a familiar swan at Kensington Gardens.  
See the entire story at:

www.pooh-corner.com/pooh.html

The original Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Kanga and Eeyore are 
now in a glass cabinet in the Donnell Center of the New 
York Public Library.  (Roo was lost in an apple orchard 
in the 1930s.)  See: 

www.nypl.org/branch/kids/pooh/winnie.html

Speaking of children, someone sent me a little Dr-Seuss-
like tale written to help explain the September 11 
attacks to children.  It resonated in my own child-like

Speaking of Dr. Seuss, many people don't realize that Dr. 
Seuss for two years (1941-1943) was the chief editorial 
cartoonist for the New York newspaper ""PM,"" and for that 
journal he drew over 400 editorial cartoons. See these 
serious political cartoons drawn in the familiar style 
during the early years of World War II at:

=> SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION

We are pleased to report continuous positive feedback 
from clients on all fronts. We posted some of the best 
comments on our Client page on the Brookwoods Group 
website at:

I will be a panelist for the ""Effective HighTech 
Marketing/PR Best Practices Panel"" at the November 10 
TiE-Houston Conference, ""Rediscovering & Accelerating the 
Entrepreneurial Spirit.""  See www.tie-houston.org for 
details.

Since my last Grapevine, we have brought on several great 
marketing and communications professionals, including 
consultant Nancy Burch and VP of Operations Lorry Harju.  
Lorry is working hard to refine our operations model and 
demonstrate added value to new and existing clients.

We ran a couple new print ads this summer, all of which 
use dogs to illustrate the predicaments of clients who 
could use help from Brookwoods Group.  One ad shows a dog 
balancing teacups on his nose 
(www.brookwoods.com/ad4.htm) and the other shows a dog 
trying to make-do with an ill-fitting solution 
(www.brookwoods.com/ad5.htm).  Frankly, some people think 
the latter ad is a little spooky.  Check it out and judge 
for yourself!

=> FRACTURED FEEDBACK

Comments from our readers...

Many readers noted that the HTML formatting did not 
really work on their mail readers.  Others received the 
formatting, but the graphics were not embedded where they 
belonged.  All in all, I think I'll stick with plain text 
for now!  If I want to show graphics, I'll use an html 
link!

Several people took us up on our offer to run a CarFax 
report for them.  

Gail Schutz commented on my bemoaning that my old car was 
always in the shop, noting, ""I have also heard it said 
that the two best days in a boat owner's life are the 
first day and the last day.""  She may be right.  My car 
has been in the shop since May (yes... May!).  

Kim Padgett noted that we use a woman on the phone in the 
bathtub as the icon for our Grapevine and ""Buzz"" sections 
of the website.  (www.brookwoods.com/buzz.htm).  She 
offered to ""try to find one with a man taking a bath on a 
cell phone for the next issue!!""  I never got a picture 
from her, but I did find a picture of a naked man talking 
on a headset.  Does that count?  See 
www.brookwoods.com/other/890829-001.jpg

Hank Moore thinks we do a very good job and produce ""one 
of the best e-newsletters that I've seen.""  Thanks, Hank!

Tom Lammers, Denise Boyd, and several others wrote that 
the test to know whether you are ready to be a parent 
left them laughing out loud.  If you missed it, see

=> GRATUITOUS HUMOROUS

With all my problems over my old car in the shop, this 
seems like a good story to tell:

A mechanic was removing a cylinder head from the motor of 
a Bentley, when he spotted a world - famous heart surgeon 
in his shop. The heart surgeon was waiting for the 
service manager to come take a look at his car. The 
mechanic yelled across he garage, ""Hey, Doc, can I ask 
you a question?""  
 
The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to the 
mechanic working on the Bentley. The mechanic 
straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, ""So 
Doc, look at this engine, I also can open hearts, take 
valves out, fix 'em, put in new parts and when I finish,  
this will work just like a new one. So how come I get a 
pittance and you get the really big money, when you and I 
are doing basically the same work?"" 
 
The surgeon paused, smiled and leaned over, and whispered 
to the mechanic...   
 
""Try doing it with the motor running.""

----

This story illustrates the importance of providing clear 
instructions, not subject to interpretation:

A couple of Kentucky hunters are out in the woods when 
one of them falls to the ground. He doesn't seem to be 
breathing, his eyes are rolled back in his head.  
 
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911. He 
gasps to the operator, ""My friend is dead! What can I 
do?""  
 
The operator, in a calm soothing voice says, ""Just take 
it easy. I can help. First, lets make sure he's dead.""  
 
...There is a silence, then a shot is heard.  
 
The guy's voice comes back on the line. He says, ""OK, now 
what?""

Developing Value-Focused Financial Strategies ? Hyperion Webcast
*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***

What drives the value of a publicly-held company ? Revenue growth?  Market share?  
Profitability?  Over the past 12 ? 18 months it seems that the financial markets have 
been focusing more on profitability as the main measure of corporate value.  But do 
today?s financial statements really reflect the true value of a company? 

Please join us for this free one-hour webcast, sponsored by Hyperion, which will focus 
on techniques for developing Value-Focused Financial Strategies.  Featured on the 
agenda will be Dr. Robert Howell, visiting professor at Dartmouth?s Tuck School of 
Business, who will suggest how financial reporting can be significantly improved so that 
investors, creditors and other stakeholders may find them more useful in making rational 
investment, credit and similar decisions.  Dr. Howell will elaborate on his views about 
driving business value based on ?free cash flow? ? views which have been published in 
a series of articles in Fortune Magazine.   Then hear from Hyperion how a unified 
approach to Financial Management can enable improved financial reporting, enhanced 
decision-making and the implementation of value-focused financial strategies.

Your questions will be answered during a live, interactive, Q&A session, giving you 
the opportunity to make specific inquiries pertaining to your organization.

About Your Speaker

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for November 11, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   The spiritual practice I am attempting to teach about isn't about 
believing anything - at least not at first.

   It isn't about attempting to get someplace - like to security.

   These matters, and others, are by-products of our willingness to 
give up trying to transcend ordinary life and simply to be with life as 
it is.

   When we gather this week, I want to talk with you - in light of what 
we have been discussing - about the principle of ""sacred unity.""

   Think about this: In his ministry Jesus was constantly inviting all 
sorts and conditions of people to him. He ate and drank with all kinds 
of people. He excluded no one. He was enacting the principle of sacred 
unity. In fact, this got him into far more trouble than any claim he 
ever made about himself.

   What might it mean for us to practice the principle of sacred unity 
in both the outer world and in our inner life?

   Whoever you are, whatever your condition I invite you to include 
yourself when the Ordinary Life gathering meets this week.

   I look forward to seeing you and being with you.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

======================================

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an 
enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present 
moment.

The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at 
St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. 
Bill Kerley. If you would like more information -

"JDF Walk for a Cure!","

    
Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October 28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruiting walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask anyway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependent diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every effort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and children!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it each time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful injections.  

I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I hope that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given to each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in your budget, you can purchase a ""JDF Shoe"" for only $5.00 and it will be posted at the Big E Caf? on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are matched by Enron!  Thanks for your support and I hope to see you on the 28th!

Lisa Sawyer

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 13, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   ""What is it that you want to do with the one, wild, precious thing
called your life?"" That is the magnificently disturbing question asked
by poet Mary Oliver.

   Questions - that is my starting point for our gathering this week.

   Questions can be dangerous - they can take us right to the edge of
all we know, of what is comfortable to us.

   Every morning of your life, whether you are conscious of it or not,
you begin your day with questions. We keep them going throughout the
day.

   Last year you filled out a questionnaire for me which I want to talk
about this Sunday. And, I want to tell you a story about the most
important question of all.

   I'm wondering - will you be there? I hope so.

Much love,


Bill Kerley

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Up for bringing refreshments this week are ?

   Krystal and Tom Irven

Crude Oil Futures Mixed on Supply Data

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX slipped 
$0.04 to $18.82 per barrel and March crude oil futures gained $0.04 
to $19.48 per barrel yesterday after the EIA reported a much smaller 
increase in crude supplies of 1 million barrels than did the API, who 
showed a 4.1 million barrel build in stocks. Heating oil stocks are 
still 30% higher than a year ago, driving refiners to cut runs and 
lowering the demand for crude. Last week, demand for heating oil was 
10% below a year ago, according to the API, further lowering 
refiners' profits, which have fallen by about 65% in the last year. 
The margin from converting 2 barrels of WTI crude into one of 
gasoline and one of heating oil is now about $2.11 per barrel. Last 
week, refinery usage dropped 1.5% to 89.4% of capacity, the lowest in 
almost a year. Distillate stocks fell by 300,000 barrels in EIA data, 
while the API reported a more significant drop of 875,000 barrels. 
Gasoline inventories climbed by 2.8 million barrels, according to the 
EIA compared to APIs report of a 4.2 million barrel rise in supplies. 
Cold weather in Europe over the last few weeks has made Brent crude 
more expensive than the higher grade WTI, which usually averages 
$0.93 above its British counterpart. Heating oil futures for February 
delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.0114 to $0.5321 per gallon. February 
gasoline futures on the NYMEX climbed $0.0065 to $0.5585 per gallon. 
In London, Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on the IPE 
were down 0.34 to $19.36 per barrel as the contract expired. March 
Brent crude rose $0.03 to $19.03 per barrel.

NYMEX Sets Crude Oil Options Trading Records 

    The NYMEX set a record volumes Tuesday in exchange-wide options 
trading, Nymex Division options trading and crude oil options 
trading. The NYMEX says trading in crude oil options set a volume 
record for the second session in a row. Tuesday's total of 119,258 
contracts topped the 83,142 contracts traded Friday, which itself had 
topped the old record of 81,622 set in March 1998. In an apparent 
allusion to the collapse of Enron, NYMEX President Robert Collins 
attributed the sharp jump in volume to market participants' interest 
in liquid, transparent means of managing price risk without exposure 
to counter-party credit risk. On Enron's Internet-based trading 
platform EnronOnline, it acted as counter-party to every trade. On 
the NYMEX, all contracts are technically with the exchange's 
clearinghouse, which provides guarantees against default. Total 
exchange options volume was 176,983 contracts, topping the October 
2000 record of 160,913. NYMEX Division options trading volume totaled 
165,291 contracts, beating the October 2000 record of 142,761.

Canadian Energy Service Sector Expects 4th Quarter Profits to Plunge


    After reporting record high 2nd-quarter profits last year when 
drilling boomed in response to strong energy prices, Canadian energy 
service firms are expected to post sharply lower 4th quarter 
earnings. A plunge in oil and natural gas prices in the 2nd half of 
2001 caused producers to cut their drilling budgets. Mild 
temperatures in November and early December, which kept the ground 
from freezing in the winter-only drilling areas of Western Canada, 
only added to the problems. On average, total earnings per share in 
the 4th quarter for Canadian drilling companies is expected to be 42% 
lower than the 3rd quarter; compared to 2000, when 4th quarter 
earnings were 56% higher than the 3rd third quarter. Precision 
Drilling, Canada's largest energy service company, saw 4th quarter 
profits of C$1.17 per share in 2000, but analysts have forecast 4th 
quarter profits for 2001 of C$0.58 per share. Ensign Resources, which 
owns 149 rigs, is expected to post 4th quarter profits of C$0.21 per 
share for 2001 compared to C$1.54 in 2000. The Petroleum Services 
Association of Canada has predicted that 13,386 wells will be drilled 
in 2002, down from about 18,000 drilled in 2001. This years forecast 
is in line with most other years over the past decade. The Toronto 
Stock Exchange's energy services sub-index dropped 35% between May 
and the end of 2001, compared to the TSE's 300 composite index, which 
fell 15% over the same period.

Chinese Petrochemical Shares Rally

  
    Shares of China's Hong Kong-listed petrochemical business jumped 
by 5% - 10% yesterday as low prices spurred a buying binge, despite 
the still poor industry fundamentals. Even though the country has an 
inventory oversupply, the share prices of chemical companies have 
already reflected the drop in demand and are now seen by many as 
being a bargain. Most of the stocks slumped last summer after several 
international investment banks cut chemical companies' ratings and 
earnings forecasts because of contracting margins and a surplus of 
supplies. However, Salomon Smith Barney raised its rating on shares 
of Shanghai Petrochemical, a major ethylene producer, from neutral to 
buy. The company's long-term prospects are still sound and with its 
dominant domestic market share, Shanghai Petrochemical seems to be 
well positioned to take advantage of the expected growth in 
chemicals, the investment firm said. Nonetheless, others say that 
Chinese product prices have dropped since the second half of 2001. 
Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs sliced its estimates for 2001/2002 
profits for Chinese chemical companies due to a drop in chemical 
margins in the last 2 quarters of 2001 and recent tariff cuts on 
chemical products following China's entry to the World Trade 
Organization.

Phillips Moving to Texas


    Oklahoma's governor plans to travel to Houston next week to plead 
his case for keeping the headquarters of the merged ConocoPhillips 
oil company in Oklahoma rather than Texas. Phillips plans to acquire 
Conoco in a stock deal worth some $17 billion, creating the world's 
6th largest investor-owned oil company. Phillips is currently based 
in Bartlesville where it was founded in 1917. But Chief Executive 
Mulva has said the merged company will be based in Houston.

Plains All American to Expand Cushing Terminal 
  
    Plains All American Pipeline has said it will proceed with the 
Phase III expansion of its Cushing Terminal Facility. Under the 
expansion, Plains will add about 1.1 million barrels of additional 
tankage. The Phase III project will increase the total capacity of 
the facility to about 5.3 million barrels and is expected to cost 
about $11 million. The 1.1 million barrel Phase II expansion project 
is currently under way and scheduled to be completed next June. 
Construction on the Phase III tankage will begin immediately and is 
expected to be operational by next December. Construction of the 
original Cushing Terminal was completed in 1994 with an initial 
capacity of 2.0 million barrels. The Phase I expansion was completed 
in mid-1999 and added 1.1 million barrels of tank capacity. 
Collectively, the Phase II and Phase III expansions will increase the 
aggregate capacity of the Cushing Terminal by 70%. Upon completion of 
the Phase II and Phase III expansion projects, the Cushing Terminal 
will consist of fourteen 100,000 barrel tanks, four 150,000 barrel 
tanks, twelve 270,000 barrel tanks and a manifold and pumping system 
capable of handling up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil throughput per 
day.

"SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

"RE: Oasis Dairy Farms Judgement - update","According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.

"GPCM News: 1/25/02: Working with Power Model Forecasts: AGA Gas Storage","Working with Power Model Forecasts

 

Recently we have been spending quite a bit of time working with
companies who are using both a power model such as Prosym, GE Maps, or
IREMM, and GPCM.  These power models compute, among other things, the
amount of gas burned at gas-fired or dual-fired generation plants.
These values are frequently then fed back to GPCM as electric generation
gas demands.  The idea was that GPCM would produce the prices for the
various power demand locations which could then be fed back to the power
model for re-calculation of demands.  This iterative process would
produce eventually a solution which was consistent between the power
model and GPCM.  The difficulty with this idea is that the power model
takes too much time to solve to make it practical.  

 

After a lot of thought, I have come up with a different idea which has
greater workability.  I would recommend the following:  instead of
running a single power model case with an expected set of gas prices for
each area, run 3 cases:  essentially a high, medium and low Henry Hub
Price forward price trajectory plus best estimates of future basis to
each power generation gas demand area.  The results will then be three
gas burns at three prices at each location.  We can then construct a
demand curve for each demand location based on those three points.  With
those demand curves, GPCM can solve for an expected price - gas burn
combination which will be an appropriately interpolated value between
the 3 points computed by the power model.  

 

When this is done, one final run could be made using the power model and
the resulting GPCM prices.  It should produce gas burns very close to
the value computed by GPCM and will contain all the information needed
by the power modeling team.

Lindy,
Do you know if we have any FERC reporting that we must report on for any reason that we would need to show the correct rates tied to the correct basin? My concern would be in areas like this when we keep the points in the W. of Thoreau and entering discounts, is there any reporting issues, or regulatory issues? TK, are you  OK with entering discounted rates all the time on all contracts? Can we enter the right tariff rates for these points?

Subject:	RE: East of CA Questions

The only circumstance where the East of CA distinction makes a difference is for tariff rate purposes (except for some policy issues concerning allowing capacity release to the border on contracts with a primary delivery point in East of CA).  East of CA is treated like West of Thoreau for other purposes such as allocations.  I was thinking that maybe we can address this by entering point-level discounts for the East of CA points (Griffith, Calpine, SWGas and the Citizens points).  Would that work without having to make numerous changes elsewhere?  Let's discuss.

Elizabeth,
 To my knowledge, the downstream PLE(Old and New), CBS Rates/Contracts, & CAS systems do not have the new basin. We will need to get these systems coded with the new basin, then get the TMS system updated and coded . I am not sure if other systems are impacted. We need to schedule a meeting with all involved from the business side and system side to determine what systems will need to be updated & who will define the requirements for these systems. Please respond to this email and let me know who from your team should be included in this meeting so I can set one up. Will you be available to meet next week or will this need to wait until after the Oct. 1st system implementation?

Thanks Ramona

Ramona,

This issue came up a long time ago regarding East of California.  I know in previous discussions, we said we would postpone because of all the downstream systems that would be impacted.  Did we ever implement changes to account for this as a separate basin under the West of Thoreau area?  If not, we need to get this in place very quickly since we have so many new points that fall into this group.  

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: Global Settlement Question

Your memo raises a lot of good questions.  In analyzing this issue it would be helpful to know what type of rates we have agreed to with the shippers that have primary delivery points East of California.  Are they all negotiated rates? Are any max. rates?  In addition, I think we need to review what rights we have provided Citizens and other EOC shippers.  I'm assuming they cannot release their capacity to California.  Have we let them use California delivery points on an alternate basis?  If so, for what term?  on a limited basis or throughout the term of their contract?  Let's also review the situation whereby we let PGE use Ignacio as an alternate receipt point.  My recollection is that we do not let them release Ignacio because it is not part of their primary path.  I think it would be helpful to have Elizabeth in these discussions.   

I reviewed the language in the Docket No. RP93-34 settlement and it is not specifically limited to Citizens.  It provides that we would establish an EOC rate for deliveries from Thoreau/San Juan point to East of California points.  The Maximum FTS-1 rate was 3.5 cents less than the maximum FTS-1 rates otherwise applicable to shippers in the WOT area.  That settlement also prohibited capacity releases by shippers paying the lower EOC rate to California delivery points.  The rates in this settlement were locked in under the Global Settlement.  Tariff sheet no. 5A has a footnote that provides that the max. reservation charge is applicable to all delivery points west of the Thoreau/San Juan Point except for deliveries to California.  

Pls. let me know when we can discuss this further.  Thanks, Maria

Subject:	Global Settlement Question

Now that we're going to have new East of CA shippers (with Red Rock), I wanted to know if customers with primary DP's in East of CA were precluded from releasing capacity to the CA border (like Citizens).  I didn't know if this applied to anyone paying an East of CA rate or if it was particular to Citizens in the settlement.  

If they are precluded from releasing to the CA border, what if they agreed to pay the CA border reservation rate when they released to the border?  Even then, I'm not sure what the ""East of CA"" customers traded for their reservation discount because it's not like they'd be paying the greater reservation all the time for the right to release to the border.

Let me know when you have a chance to discuss.  It's not urgent, but I thought we should be sure to communicate this correctly to our new East of CA shippers.

ARTICLE:
Will the U.S. regulate CO2 from power plants, giving a massive lift to the
fledgling market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions?

The U.S. Congress continues to discuss regulation of CO2 from power plants
as part of a comprehensive package to address power plant air pollution.
Hearings were convened late last year by the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee to discuss the merits of a four-pollutant power plant
strategy-controlling SO2, NOx, mercury, and CO2 emissions in a coordinated
fashion.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 13, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   I mentioned to you a few weeks ago that nothing divides the 
Christian church in the Western world any more than views on how to 
interpret the Bible. On the one hand there is either the natural or 
conscious literal approach and, on the other, the mytho-poetic 
approach. The topics over which various groups within the Christian 
tradition have the most controversy are views about creation, 
homosexuality and the historic Jesus.

   We will have a first-hand opportunity to explore one of these - the 
issue of homosexuality - this Sunday as a mother and daughter share 
with us their story.

   Jennifer Feather grew up in the St. Paul's community. Her mother, 
SuZanne Feather, has been very active at St. Paul's.

   The Ordinary Life Gathering will combine with the Point of View 
Class this Sunday to hear these two women share their experience. About 
what they will be doing, Jennifer writes this:

   ""Religion is a fundamentally communal experience. Shared beliefs and 
rituals form its foundations. However, the practice of our faith is 
also inextricably bound to our own personal experience. Our individual 
relationship to God is as important as our communal experience of 
religion. Our differences from one another make the competing demands 
of individuality and community evident.

   ""Sexuality has become a divisive issue in the Church precisely 
because it brings to light these difficulties.

   ""Having grown-up at St. Paul's, the interplay between individual 
difference and this community has shaped my experience of my faith.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of December 30, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks ?

   On the last Sunday of 2001, we talked about the matter of time. How
fast it passes! What are we to do with it? We are to wait. This class
was about what we are waiting for and how we are to wait. The answers
are both maddening and embarrassing. There is also an excursion here
about how to read the Bible and how Fundamentalism came to be.

   I hope you find this inspirational and valuable as you reflect on
the year just passed and prepare for what is to come.

   Some famous author once wrote (and I can't find his name now): ""No
one ever greeted the first of the year with indifference. I believe
that is true. It is a time of new beginnings and of hope. I wish that
for you.

   What follows is the full text from which I spoke on Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

           Hurry Up and Wait

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Living life is an art. Our lives and our living are pieces of art to
create. Isn't that a great concept? Learning this art is important
because we don't have much time to live, do we?

   This stuff we call ""time"" goes so fast, so very fast.

   I'm fascinated with time, utterly fascinated. I have surrounded
myself with countless devices for measuring the passing of time.

   For years and years I kept a Day-Timer. I experimented with various
sizes and styles. I think I was hoping that if I found the perfect
system, I'd be able to accomplish all that I wanted to. Wrong! I've
never been able to do that. But, keeping a DayTimer did enable me to
see what I do with time and why and what I allow time to do with me and
why. I can experience how rapidly it passes and how slowly it drags
out. Now for years I've gone paperless and have been using a Palm
device. It serves the same function as a DayTimer - just easier to
carry.

   If I go back and look at pages from my DayTimer from several years
ago it sometimes seems like I was another person.

   When I began doing sitting meditation I could experience time as if
it were molasses or as a flash of lightening. Sometimes it seems I have
been sitting forever and I will open my eyes to see that only a few
minutes have passed. At other times, an hour passes in five minutes.

   Time is so central to us. Think of all the books we read, the
instructions we follow, the activities we do just to help us structure
time. Early on in life someone gives us a watch and says to us, ""Don't
be late again."" They make an assumption. They assume that we know how
to tell time.

   ""What did you do?""
   ""What are you doing?""
   ""What are you going to do?"" These are all time questions.

   When you look at life spiritually, which really is your only option,
there is a meaningful answer to all the questions we raise about time.
But we find the answer both maddening and embarrassing.

   Maddening because it turns out that what we are to do with our time
is to wait.

   The word ""wait"" is one of the most characteristic words in the
Bible.

   ""Wait on the Lord.""
   ""They that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the earth.""
   ""My soul waits for the Lord more than they that watch for the
morning.""

   According to my count the word ""wait"" is found in the Bible exactly
100 times. If I were to read them all, you would wait a long time. Who
wants to spend time like that? What's so maddening about waiting is
that we don't know how. We don't like encountering or being confronted
with stuff we don't know how to do.

   In my own life one of the frustrating and disappointing things I've
noticed is how I've backslidden in the area of patience.

   Sometimes we structure time by getting involved in a process we call
""business as usual."" When we do that, the right now - the present
moment - is stripped of any urgency or importance it might have.

   These gatherings we've been calling Ordinary Life aren't about
business as usual. Those of you here who have trouble with the church
have this complaint. The church has often pretended it didn't live in
the twentieth century. So the church has sometimes ignored the vast
changes taking place out there in the world. Being the last to speak
about major issues ? integrity, being good stewards of the earth's
resources, learning to live interdependently, sexist language, outdated
world view ? you name it.

   Religious organizations, churches and synagogues, constitute the
second largest land-holder and purchaser of goods and services in this
country. What a power we could be! And yet, historically, the church
has had to be hit over the head before it opens its eyes to what is
happening in the world, content to let the world be damned unless it
enters our ecclesiastical ghetto. No urgency, no living on tiptoe, not
breathless as to the Kingdom of God being here and now. Just business
as usual.

   I said a moment ago that looking at the world spiritually is our
only option. That isn't true. You can look at the world religiously.
I'm going to overstate this case. Religion is about fear. Spirituality
is what's on the other side of fear. As someone once said: ""Religion is
for people who are afraid of hell. Spirituality is for people who have
been there.""

   When I was growing up in a Southern Baptist Church in Columbia,
Tennessee, a lot of my religious instruction was fear-based. There are
some words and phrases that I wish I'd never heard, not because they
are not good words, but because they got so contaminated. Among these
are words like ""sin,"" ""commitment,"" ""dedication.""

   We hear phrases growing up that shape us. I said in one of our
recent times together that there is nothing wrong with you. You're just
fine. In response to that someone who gets the e-mail summaries of this
class sent me this:

   ""Unless you were raised by wolves, the chances are extremely good
that as you were growing up you heard at least a few of the following:

   Don't do that.
   Stop that.
   Put that down.
   I told you not to do that.
   Why don't you ever listen?
   Wipe that look off your face.
   I'll give you something to cry about.
   Don't touch that.
   You shouldn't feel that way.
   You should have known better.
   Will you ever learn?
   You should be ashamed of yourself.
   Shame on you.
   I can't believe you did that.
   Don't ever let me see you do that again.
   See, that serves you right.
   Because I told you so.
   Are you ever going to get it?
   What were the last words out of my mouth?
   What were you thinking of?
   You ruin everything.
   You have no sense.
   You're nuts. The nurses must have dropped you on your head.
   Just once, do something right.
   I've sacrificed everything for you and what thanks do I get?
   I had great hopes for you.
   If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times.
   Give an inch and you take a mile.
   Anybody would know that.
   Don't talk back to me.
   You'll do as you are told.
   That's not funny.
   Who do you think you are?
   Why did you do it that way?
   You were born bad.
   You drive me crazy.
   You do that just to hurt me.
   I could skin you alive.
   What will the neighbors say?
   You do that to torture me.
   You're so mean.
   I could beat the daylights out of you.
   Don't you dare look at me like that.
   You're just a little brat.
   It's all your fault.
   You make me sick.
   You're trying to kill me.
   Now, what's the matter with you, crybaby?
   Go to your room.
   You deserve it.
   Eat it because children are starving.
   Don't stick your lip out.
   If you cry, I'll slap you.
   Don't you ever think about anyone else?
   Get out of my sight.
   Do as I say not as I do.

   ""Hearing lines like these, somewhere along the way you concluded
that there was something wrong with you.
   ""What else could you conclude?
   ""If there were nothing wrong with you, people wouldn't say things
like that to you or treat you that way!""

   We heard those lines because those who spoke them had heard them. It
is with our awareness that we are to break the chain of saying such
lines - our awareness and compassion.

   In order to do this, we must take some words and phrases and
retranslate them. That's is part of our agenda in the weeks ahead.

   Meanwhile, back to waiting.

   There is a little story in the Bible that is very instructive.

   It is found in Luke 12:42-46.

   ""And the Lord replied, 'I'm talking to any faithful, sensible man
whose master gives him the responsibility of feeding the other
servants. If his master returns and finds that he has done a good job,
there will be a reward ? his master will put him in charge of all he
owns.
   But if the man begins to think, 'My Lord won't be back for a long
time,' and begins to whip the men and women he is supposed to protect,
and to spend his time at drinking parties and in drunkenness ? well,
his master will return without notice and remove him from his position
of trust and assign him to the place of the unfaithful.""

   The master goes away and entrusts his estate to a servant who
doesn't do what he is supposed to do.

   Jesus was talking about the religious institution and religious
leaders of his day.

   If he were here, he might be saying it to us. Well, we haven't gone
to beating people and getting drunk a lot but men and women have been
beaten by the massive indifference of the church to the problems of
race and poverty and peace and religious institutions have gotten drunk
on buildings and power and prestige. The reaction of some people to
this behavior is a kind of disenchantment with the church, or disgust
with the church, or indifference to the church.

   I was astounded at the statistic when I heard it. Sixty percent of
persons now alive in this country have never been to church.

   I graduated from high school on the eve of the Supreme Court's
decision to desegregate public schools. 1955. When I was just a little
boy, I knew about the injustice in the racial system in the South where
I lived. I was frustrated and angry with the church about it's
blindness, about its participation in this system.

   I wanted nothing to do with business as usual. So, I became part of
a movement to ""abolish the old. Down with bureaucracy. Spirituality is
about change. The moment is now. Stale water is turned into heady wine.
The new age is here. The future is now. We shall overcome. There is no
time for business as usual. Let's grab the future in our bare hands and
bring it here.""

   So we marched and we sat and we debated and wrote and then you know
what we did? We waited. We realized we weren't so powerful. Now I can
look back and see that though ""business as usual"" for a religious
organization can get it away from its fundamental purpose and create a
cultural ghetto; dragging change in can be equally idolatrous. Creating
life isn't up to us, we aren't that powerful.

   How maddening it is to discover that we don't know how to wait.

   What's more, we are embarrassed about what it is we are waiting for.

   So embarrassed, I've never even talked about it in here.

   We are to wait. But what good does it do to watch and wait if we
don't know what we are looking for and waiting for? What are we waiting
for, anyway?

   You're waiting for me to say.

   We're waiting - for the second coming.

   Isn't that what you were talking about at work this past week? No?

   When I was working on this for today, I had this fantasy during the
week of someone inviting a visitor to this class and saying to that
person something like: ""I'd like for you to come to my Sunday School
Class.""
   ""Well, Sunday School isn't for me.""
   ""But this isn't your usual Sunday School class. It's not a Bible
study, no outdated religious language.""

   And so far today I've read from the Bible and am talking about the
""second coming.""

   Let me say a word or two about the Bible.

   Conflict about the Bible is the single most divisive issue among
Christians - especially in this country. The conflict, as Marcus Borg
points out, is about two very different ways of interpreting or reading
the Bible. One way is a ""literal-factual"" way and the other is a
""historical-metaphorical"" way.

   The ""literal-factual"" way is the way most fundamentalists approach
the Bible. As you might guess, I'm in the ""historical-metaphorical""
camp. This would be very important to how I would describe my religious
posture. Not only am I non-literalistic but also non-exclusivistic. I
am living out my relationship to God within the Christian tradition but
I want to honor the validity of all the enduring religious traditions.
There is no way to know what is ""the truth"" about this because there is
no way we can step outside our own personal and cultural history and
context. You'll have to test for yourself whether what I am saying
about this makes sense to you or not.

   The conflict about the Bible can be seen showing up in three arenas.
First, is the view over the creation of the earth - creationism versus
evolution.

   The second is the raging debate dividing the church today over
homosexuality.

   The third has to do with one's view of Jesus. The renewed quest for
the historical Jesus has been met with much negativity among
fundamentalist and conservative Christians. To see Jesus as a man
strikes at the very heart of their faith.

   Fundamentalism - regardless of which religion you find it in - is a
very modern phenomenon. It is a reaction against modern culture and
appeared, in the United States, only early in the twentieth century. It
stresses the infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible in every aspect.
And it has done so militantly. Someone has said that a Fundamentalist
is an evangelical Christian who is angry about something.

   Martin Luther and John Calvin - leaders of the Protestant
Reformation certainly had high regard for the Bible but never took a
view that it was infallible in the way current fundamentalists do.

   You also have to keep in mind that ordinary people simply did not
read the Bible until about 500 years ago. Only if you were educated and
knew Latin, Greek or Hebrew and had access to handwritten manuscripts
could you do so. Two events changed this. One was the invention of the
printing press and the other was the translation of the Scriptures into
a common language.

   Making the Bible available to everybody has been a mixed blessing. A
positive one is that it made real what the Protestant Reformation was
all about - the priesthood of believers or, as Marcus Borg calls it,
the democratization of Christianity. No longer are the riches of the
Bible known only to a few. When William Tyndale translated the Bible
into English, his reward was that he was burned at the stake. He wanted
to enable ""a boy that driveth the plow to know more of the Scriptures
than a priest.""

   But, the negative side is that it has made possible individual
interpretations of the Bible that has led to more divisions among
Christians than any other single thing. Think of it: prior to the
invention of the printing press no one had seen such a thing as a
Bible. It didn't exist as a single bound book. It was a collection of
various manuscripts usually referred to as ""the Scriptures."" What we
call the Gospels were first referred to as ""memoirs"" of the Apostles.
But once all the books were selected (which is another story!) and
bound into one volume, it was easy to think of the Bible as a single
book - not the library that it is - and that this book had a single
author, God.

   Fundamentalism brings with it not only changes in how we view the
Bible but in how we view so much else. Like time. Sherry pointed out to
me an article in the New York Times yesterday (12/29/01) on billable
hours. If one takes a billable hours approach to life, every hour is
just like every other. There is not much room for quality, worth,
satisfaction in a job well done, or for ritual.

   Take our personal relationships. I ran across a phrase in
""Spirituality and Health"" that caught me up short: Intimacy: In-time-I-
see.

   We are taught to keep time by billable hours, to focus on ""quality
time,"" ""watch the clock,"" etc. Yet, at the heart of a useful spiritual
practice is how we relate to time. I stress to you the importance of a
practice. I don't care what it is. But something that consciously
grounds you, that gives you a perspective on your life and the events
through which you navigate.

   One of the most important spiritual practices can be summed up by
the words ""watching and waiting."" But what are we watching and waiting
for? The Christian answer is ""the second coming."" Bear with me.

   The watching and the waiting in spiritual practice is supposed to
give an invigorating sense of existential urgency to the way we live
our lives. You know how we can allow drab routine to eat large hunks
out of our lives. And it is kind of hard to get that sense of urgency
if it turns out that what we're waiting for is something as seemingly
far-removed as the second coming.

   I asked a Jewish rabbi (a redundancy) once on the television show I
did years ago if the Jews were still expecting the messiah. He said:
""About as much as you Christians are looking for the second coming.""
Which is to say, not much. Not really.

   Those of us who worship across the street say the Apostles' Creed
and it has the lines about Jesus coming back to judge the quick and the
dead. But let's face it. Let's be honest. In our day-to-day lives none
of us is craning our necks and straining our eyes waiting for some
cosmic catastrophe that might occur in five seconds or five million
years. The second coming just doesn't have any realistic relationship
to the way we live our lives. So the notion of the ""second coming"" just
drops out of sight.

   And why shouldn't it? I grew up being taught that I'd better be
careful because ""Jesus is coming back like a thief in the night.""

   When I was just a child, I can remember Billy Graham assuring us
that we were living in ""the last days.""

   I'm both embarrassed and angry about the way this notion of the
second coming has been used to manipulate and scare people into
goodness. I'm not the only person in this room who has heard, ""Don't do
anything you wouldn't want to be caught doing when Jesus comes.""

   And yet, I can say to you, that learning to wait for the second
coming, is a large part of the art of living. My goal in the rest of
this presentation is to try to make that clear.

   The second coming is not some date off out there in the future. To
wait literally for Jesus to appear in the sky is as misinformed as it
would be to go on some archaeological search for the Garden of Eden and
Adam and Eve. Those things don't literally exist. Never did.

   What Jesus talked to people about was the urgency of the time in
which they lived. That's what that story of his I read to you is about.
It is about an expected coming and a delay.

   Jesus spoke this parable to the religious leaders of the day and was
trying to arouse them to the fact that their day of destiny as the
people of God was upon them - right now. They were being visited with
the truth - right now. They were to know what hour it is and be ready.
They were to recognize the ultimate choices of life and death when
those choices were present and they were present right now.

   That's what the early church was focusing on when it talked about
the second coming. They were giving life the urgency that life calls
for; they were recognizing the nearness of the ultimate; the constant
possibility of experiencing the presence of God. They did that in the
symbol of Christ coming back.

   Spiritual language is full of symbols like that, symbols that convey
a truth that is greater than literal truth. Symbols are what make truth
vivid.

   For example, one abiding truth, one of our continuing experiences is
the tendency we have to deny our humanity and attempt to be God to
ourselves. This is what sin is. This sin is such a central issue in the
living of our lives that you can never really say all there is to say
about it. What is needed is a story to convey it. Everything you always
wanted to know about sin but were afraid to ask is therefore contained
in a story about a man and a woman named Adam and Eve.

   That's the way it is with the second coming. If you get hung up on
or embarrassed by taking the symbol of the second coming literally,
you'll miss its real meaning and impact

   Here it is: There is nothing out there we need to draw into our
lives, there is nothing out there we need to keep out of our lives that
will make us happy or bring us fulfillment. Or, that will keep us from
experiencing the harm, difficulties, problems, and failures that are a
part of being human. To get involved in either one of those activities
is to miss the experience of hope and judgment right here, right now.

   If we turn our backs on this sometimes hard, brutal, grim world as
it is, we turn our backs on the only source for knowing God we ever
have had or every will have. If we turn our backs on the present by
concentrating on getting stuff into or keeping stuff out of our lives,
we'll miss God in the now. The heart of spiritual truth is about the
reality that God is right here, right now.

   Now, I'll grant this is sometimes hard to see. Finding God in the
world is sometimes like trying to see the picture in those magic eye
things. You have to develop another way of seeing.

   Nothing is easier than to miss the God who is always present among
us and between us. The God who is present in the headlines of today's
paper and in the requests of those who call for us to help.

   I want what happens in here to be about God in the world now and the
urgency of finding God in the world now.

   That's what the second coming is about. The second coming is a
powerful symbol that conveys a truth too important to forget. I'm not
asking you to believe that Jesus is going to come knocking on your door
tonight or that he is going to come back and walk the streets as a
human being as he did before. To get you to look for the second coming
is just a dramatic way to get us to stop and think. And that's just
what happened in this room a few minutes ago when I first used the
phrase ""second coming."" It got your attention. Supposing our everyday
lives were suddenly crossed by his? What would he think of us or we of
him?

   Second coming. That's picture language. Dramatic language. It isn't
describing in advance a literal event that you could pick up on a radar
screen. You know, I hope, that the story of Adam and Eve is not
describing an incident that happened only once in the past. The story
of Adam and Eve and Cain and Able ? and all the rest ? describes
something that continues to happen to all of us all the time.

   That's the way it is with the second coming. It is not just a single
event that might or might not happen in our lifetime. If it were a
literal event, it would have meaning only for those in whose lifetime
it took place.

   The symbol of the second coming, if understood properly, helps us
recognize and live with the reality that is meeting us all the time and
continues to meet us all the time. It is not just something that is
confined to the end.

   The phrase ""second coming"" is nowhere in the Bible. A more accurate
translation of it would be ""presence."" What it means is that we all the
time live on the edge of time. We forget this. Our actions, whether
good or not, have an ultimate significance. Our actions, whether good
or not, have effects of infinite range and scope. We are always
standing under incalculable responsibility. We are to be faithful in
little things because there are no little things. We are to be faithful
in God's absence because God is never absent. To be concerned with the
end in this way is to deal with the right here, right now.

   Everywhere, all the time, what we call Christ is present. No way of
getting away from it. Go wherever you want. Wait till doomsday if you
wish. There is still that standard of love and justice all around us ?
in the person who sitting next to you right now, in the headlines of
today's paper, in the obscure stories on the back pages, in the
requests to meet the needs of the down-and-out that we feed lunches to
across the street, or, in the so-called sophistication of the up-and-in
worshipping in the cathedral across the street. It is this presence we
are to watch for. It is this presence we are to wait for.

   How do we do that?  How are we to structure our time so that we can
be sensitive to that Holy Presence right here, right now?

   We are to wait.

   I mentioned earlier that the word ""wait"" is used a hundred times in
the Bible. Of course, the word ""wait"" is a translation from Hebrew and
Greek into English. As with all languages, you can't translate from one
into the other without losing something.

   One meaning of the word ""wait"" in the Bible draws the picture of
being stretched taut, of being pulled. Much as you might twist the
strands of fiber to make a rope. This is the tension of enduring. So
there is a line in the Psalms that goes, ""My soul waits for the Lord
more than they that watch for the morning."" You can almost see the
passionate expectancy of the watchman eagerly looking out into the
night watching for every little noise, being alert, watching for the
dawn. That's waiting. It is expecting something that hasn't happened to
happen and it is to be looking out for it.

   We are not pushed by the past or pulled by the future. We are not
what we have been nor what we will be. At each moment we are free to
change the significance of the past for the present and free to choose
a new mode of expressing ourselves in the future. Each moment demands
that we make ourselves over by another free choice. And that moment is
now. I don't know a better definition of spiritual well-being than
this. Spiritual well-being is the absence of ""elsewhereness."" It is
""presenteesism"" in contrast to ""absenteeism."" Years ago, I was planning
an event with my son and I asked him when he wanted to do it. He said,
""I want to do it in the middle of right now."" That's the only time
we've got.

   There is another word for ""wait"" in the Bible. It is a kind of
quiet, meditative, passive waiting. It is the kind of waiting we do
when we are without any conscious awareness of God's nearness. It is in
the line, ""They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength.""

   We shortchange this kind of waiting with our impatience and our
franticness. Yet, this kind of waiting is a crucial part of every
spiritual tradition. It's the forty years in the wilderness and the
fifty years in exile in the Old Testament. It was the generations
before Jesus came, the 40 days in the desert.

   It is in waiting like this that the very reality of faith is
unfolded because faith implies a certain not having, a certain not
knowing, a certain being without. It is in waiting like this that faith
is faith and not superstition. It is in this kind of waiting where
being religious is so dangerous and being spiritual is so essential.

   Somehow, which is what I hope our times in here are ultimately all
about, we must learn to play this waiting game by holding both kinds of
waiting together. The passionate expectancy in one hand, the mystery of
it all in the other. This is how we are to structure our time.

   If you have ever had to do any significant waiting, you know that
it's good to have a place to be while you wait. That's what this
gathering we call Ordinary Life is about.

   Someone asked once, how do you join this class? You can't join. If
you are here, you are a member. And if you are a member, your business
is about the management of this estate with which you have been
entrusted.

   There is a very instructive line in the middle of that story of
Jesus. ""Happy is the servant if the master finds that person faithfully
discharging these duties when he comes again.""

   It's the ""happy"" that is in this prayer I offer for and about you.

   May you be filled with loving kindness and compassion.
   May you be happy.
   May you be peaceful and at ease.
   May you be well.
   May no harm come to you.
   May no difficulties come to you.
   May no problems come to you.
   May you always meet with success.
   May you also be given the patience (ability to wait), the courage,
the understanding, and the determination to meet and overcome the
inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures that are a part of this
life.

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

Subject:	Indicated Shippers

I just received a voice mail from Kathy Edwards, attorney for Indicated Shippers.  She said her clients were not willing to ""carve-out"" the two issues of competitive bidding and scheduling rights for the Commission to decide as separate policy issues.  Indicated shippers said both issues have to be a part of a settlement.

Based on the input I have received from TW thus far, Indicated Shippers demands may make a settlement impossible.  We need to consider whether TW is willing to go further in regard to either or both of the Indicated Shippers positions (so far TW has said no).  Additionally thought should be given to whether appointment of a settlement judge at this time might be helpful.

I will try to get a call set up to discuss.  In the mean time, any feedback you have would be helpful.  Greg

Crude Oil Futures Regain Some Ground

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX rose $0.20 
to $20.38 per barrel yesterday, regaining some ground lost over the 
last 3 sessions. After hefty declines over the last 2 sessions, short-
covering was likely responsible for the lift in lieu of any 
significant market moving news. Traders are now closely watching OPEC 
and non-member producers compliance levels with their most recently 
announced production curbs. Although many are skeptical of strict 
compliance by either OPEC or non-aligned producing nations, the 
market is now waiting for early results in February. Inventory data 
earlier in the week suggested that demand continues to drop as oil 
and derivatives stockpiles grew, failing to give traders any 
reassurance that the demand versus supply equation will soon be 
balanced. Crude usage is 4% below a year ago. Unseasonably mild 
weather has allowed heating oil stocks to rise 16.2 million barrels, 
or about 35% above a year ago. Total crude and product stocks are now 
about 88 million barrels, or almost 10%t, above a year ago after 
climbing by more than 6 million barrels last week, according to EIA 
data. The EIA predicts that petroleum demand will remain sluggish 
through June, but recover along with the US economy during the second 
half of 2002. The supply cuts should raise crude oil prices to about 
$25-$26 per barrel by the end of 2002, the EIA said. Heating oil for 
February delivery on the NYMEX climbed $0.0154 to $0.5533 per gallon. 
February gasoline futures on the NYMEX added $0.009 to $0.5896 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on 
the IPE were up $0.40 to $21.29 per barrel.

Valero to Upgrade Texas City Refinery 

    Valero Energy plans a $300 million upgrade to its Texas City 
refinery that will expand its refining capacity to 260,000 bpd in 2 
years. Valero will add a 45,000 bpd coker unit, which will enable it 
to process heavier, high sulfur crude oil. It has entered into a long-
term supply contract with PMI Comercio Internacional for 90,000 bpd 
of Maya crude after the coker is installed. That will raise its total 
commitment with PMI to more than 170,000 bpd of crude oil. Valero has 
just completed a $4.2 billion acquisition of Ultramar Diamond 
Shamrock, making it the largest independent refiner in the nation.

MMS Appeals California Offshore Drilling Rulling
  

    The Interior Department is appealing a District Court ruling in 
June that the MMS improperly extended 36 offshore tracts leased by 
oil companies in southern California by not providing the state with 
an opportunity to review the leases. The MMS said it is not appealing 
the case to allow drilling to proceed, but instead wants to preserve 
its authority over drilling issues. The agency contends that the 
suspension of the leases have no effect on California's coastal uses 
or resources. The appeal is being heard in the Court of Appeals for 
the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Critics contend that 
administration is trying to make it easier to drill new oil wells off 
the state's coast. Oil companies spent more than $1 billion from the 
late 1960s to the mid-1980s for drilling rights on the leases, 
offshore of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
Leaseholders include Aera Energy, a joint venture between ExxonMobil 
and Shell; Conoco; Nuevo Energy and a subsidiary of Noble Affiliates. 
The leased tracts were exempted from the Clinton administration's ban 
on new oil drilling in southern California waters because the leases 
were so old. Drilling projects can proceed only if given clearance by 
the Interior Department.

BP Announces Lowered Tax Rate


    In a trading statement ahead of full results next month, BP said 
it expects to pay tax at a rate of 20% for the 4th quarter, compared 
to a 25% rate in the 3rd quarter. The lower tax rate could add an 
extra $150-200 million to the company's coffers. BP made over $3 
billion in net profit for the 3rd quarter. Tax on its oil supplies in 
some countries, including Britain, are levied at the price those 
stocks were worth at production. As a result, lower prices in the 
quarter equate to lower taxes relative to earnings, which are usually 
measured at current costs. However, the tax concessions BP earns in 
some countries, like the US, are made in absolute amounts, so as a 
percentage of lower earnings, they have a more significant impact. 
During the 4th quarter BP also earned an unusually high number of tax 
concessions linked to new capital investments. There were no other 
major surprises in the trading statement. The statement pointed to 
much tougher trading conditions than the oil industry experienced in 
2000 and early 2001. But the industry continues to be very profitable 
with oil prices still well above their mid-cycle assumptions of $16 
per barrel. Oil refining margins also fell by about $1.60 per barrel 
while US natural gas prices were hit by higher storage levels and a 
drop in demand.

Tarpon Pipeline Delays Restart 
  
    The 70,000 bpd Tarpon crude oil pipeline offshore in the Gulf of 
Mexico delayed a planned restart yesterday due to poor diving 
conditions. The pipeline carries mainly domestic sweet crude, Light 
Louisiana Sweet, to refiners and lifters. It has been down since 
December 29th, when workers doing routine maintenance discovered an 
problem. On Monday, about 40,000 bpd were diverted to the Auger 
pipeline, which normally carries Eugene Island crude. Prices for both 
Eugene Island and LLS have been supported by the pipeline outage.

Energy Industry May See Substantial 4th-Quarter Write? Downs


    The rash of energy acquisitions earlier in the year could take a 
heavy toll on 4th quarter bottom lines of a number of companies. 
There are predictions that 4th quarter write-downs in the energy 
industry could total as much as $10 billion. According to accounting 
principles, companies are required to recalculate the value of their 
oil and natural gas reserves at end-of-quarter prices and take a 
charge if the value is less than that on their books. The lucrative 
natural gas market of the 2001's 1st and 2nd quarters led to 
increased  costs of acquisitions and drilling activity. Last winter 
and spring, many in the industry thought that natural gas prices 
would be in the $3 - $4 per Mcf range for the foreseeable future and 
many acquisitions were based on those numbers. But natural gas prices 
were at $2.57 per Mcf at year's end amid a wilting economy and 
unseasonably mild weather which ate away at demand for natural gas. 
At the end of the 3rd quarter, Anadarko took a pretax charge of $827 
million on its Canadian oil and gas assets. In addition, Burlington 
Resources has said it will take a pretax charge of up to $225 million 
due to the planned sale of assets worth about $500 million. Asset 
write-downs are not a cash loss and usually do not affect stock 
prices when they are announced.

OPEC Output Down in December, But Still Above Ceiling

     OPEC produced 25.83 million bpd of crude in December, down 
970,000 bpd from November, but still 599,000 bpd above its self-
imposed ceiling, according to Platts. The relatively large month-to-
month drop was due largely to Iraq, whose exports fell considerably 
amid uncertainty over official Iraqi selling prices. Excluding Iraq, 
which does not have an OPEC quota, production from the remaining 10 
members fell by just 190,000 bpd to 23.81 million bpd, 599,000 bpd 
above the 23.20 million bpd ceiling. A new, lower ceiling of 21.701 
million bpd came into effect January 1st, following OPEC's meeting in 
Cairo. It is widely believed that OPEC is unlikely to achieve 
anything close to the 2.1 million bpd cut it would have to make this 
month in order to comply fully with its new ceiling. Indonesia, whose 
oil production has been steadily falling, was the only country to 
produce within quota in December. Other countries exceeded their 
quotas by volumes ranging from a few thousand barrels in the case of 
the UAE to as much as 239,000 bpd in the case of Nigeria. Apart from 
Libya, which maintained output at November levels, and Kuwait, whose 
production rose slightly, most countries decreased output. Iraq 
accounted for the single biggest drop, 780,000 bpd, while other 
decreases ranged between 10,000 bpd and 70,000 bpd.

Natural Gas Futures Rally on AGA Report

    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped 
$0.103 higher yesterday to $2.394 per MMBtu. The March contract 
gained $0.09 to $2.363 per MMBtu. The market began the day up and 
pushed higher after a 137 Bcf withdrawal was reported by the AGA in 
the afternoon. The storage report was about what was expected, but 
was 37 Bcf more than a year ago. However, it barely dented the record 
amounts of inventory remain in storage, about 2.529 Tcf, at 77% full 
compared to 44% full last year at this time at 1.459 Tcf. The 5-year 
average is 2 Tcf. The rally broke through the $2.36 resistance level. 
Funds are holding record-high short positions and could cause a major 
technical rally if they ever had to cover. But, more likely the 
market will head back down as the fundamentals takeover. Support is 
seen at $2.36, $2.32 and $2.25 per MMBtu. A cold front expected to 
move into eastern states next week and could cause the market to 
rally again, but the increase will be difficult to sustain. Natural 
gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat 
to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next delivery at the hub 
gained $0.03 to $2.39 per MMBtu.

 PG&E Ads Blast California PUC Lawsuit

  
    PG&E has bought full-page advertisements in newspapers throughout 
California blasting a giant state fraud lawsuit against the bankrupt 
utility in a bid to topple the company's reorganization plan. The ads 
reprinted a recent letter to the employees of Pacific Gas and 
Electric from the chairman and chief executive of the parent company. 
He wrote that the lawsuit by the California Attorney General 
contained false and unwarranted accusations. The lawsuit charges that 
PG&E drained cash from the utility during the California power 
emergency to fund new businesses and drove the company into 
bankruptcy and seeks damages of $600 million to $4 billion. The 
attorney general and the PUC are working to derail the utility's 
reorganization plan because they don't want to lose regulatory 
jurisdiction over the company, the ad said. The plan would shift the 
utility's power generation and energy transmission systems to new 
companies formed by PG&E and beyond state jurisdiction.

Calpine Revises 2001 and 2002 Earnings Estimates

    Calpine has lowered its earnings estimates for 2001 and 2002. It 
now expects profits of $1.95 per share for 2001 compared to estimates 
of $2.00 per share. For 2002, it expects earnings of $1.70 per share 
versus estimates of $2.20 per share. Even though Calpine lowered its 
estimate for 2001, it will see its profits rise by 63% above 2000 
earnings. Calpine also revised its capital spending budget downward 
by $2 billion saying it will complete 27 power projects, accounting 
for 15,200 MW, which are currently being built. Another 34 projects 
in the advanced development stage will be on hold until demand for 
power increases. It is also negotiating with major equipment 
suppliers to adjust payment schedules and revise delivery timing in 
line with its new construction schedule. Calpine, Mirant and other 
power generators have delayed or canceled billions of dollars in 
projects in an attempt to bolster credit ratings and reassure 
investors. Last month, Moody's lowered Calpine's credit rating to 
junk and said it remained on review for further possible downgrades. 
Calpine has raised almost $5 billion in the last 3 months, including 
a $2.6 billion bond sale. Its current generating capacity is 11,100 
MW, but was scheduled to have up to 70,000 MW by the end of 2005. It 
now expects to have 26,300 MW by the end of 2003. Plants with a 
combined capacity of 82,000 MW have been canceled or postponed. 
Plants under construction with another 200,000 MW of capacity are on 
the auction block.

FERC to Create Power Market Oversight Unit

  The FERC plans to create a new market oversight unit to prevent 
manipulation of wholesale electricity prices and supplies. The new 
Office of Market Oversight and Investigations is designed to protect 
customers through vigilant oversight of the nation's energy market, 
according to the FERC. It plans to have the office operating with a 
staff of over 50 by this Spring. The FERC currently has an office of 
Markets Tariffs and Rates, which monitors markets in a broad way. 
But, the new office will be FERC's first attempt of defining and 
curbing market power, either through refund orders or courts.

JP Morgan Posts 4th Quarter Loss 

    JP Morgan Chase posted its first quarterly loss in 5 years after 
it wrote off loans to Argentina and Enron. The bank lost $332 
million, or $0.18 per share, compared with earnings of $0.34 per 
share, or $708 million, in the 4th quarter of 2000. The banks 
decision to lend to Enron, Argentina and others that defaulted kept 
it from profiting from the lowest interest rates in 40 years. 
Competitors that took advantage of the low rates are reporting 
increased earnings. JP Morgan took a write-off of $456 million for 
trading losses and loans to Enron and still has exposure of $2.06 
billion of potential losses. The lender had a complex relationship 
with Enron as it traded with the company, advised it and loaned it 
money. JP Morgan will attempt to recover its Enron loans, some of 
which were not backed by collateral, in bankruptcy court. The bank is 
also suing insurance companies for $965 million for insured oil and 
natural gas contracts. In addition, JP Morgan took a charge of $351 
million for loans to Argentina, which devalued its currency and 
defaulted on its bonds. It is one of 4 US lenders with large 
exposures in the country. The bank said it lost $385 million in its 
private equity business, and also allowed $510 million to cover 
further possible loan defaults in response to deteriorating market 
conditions.

Marathon Announces 2 Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Dry Holes

    Marathon Oil did not encounter hydrocarbons at the company's 
Paris Carver and Flathead exploratory wells in the deepwater Gulf of 
Mexico. The Paris Carver and Flathead wells are located in Green 
Canyon Block 601 and Walker Ridge Block 30, respectively.  Paris 
Carver was drilled to a total depth of 24,120 feet in 4,572 feet of 
water, and Flathead was drilled to a total depth of 28,043 feet in 
6,556 feet of water.  Marathon has plugged and abandoned the Paris 
Carver well.  The Flathead well has been temporarily abandoned and, 
after completing additional technical studies, Marathon is 
considering reentering and sidetracking options. Marathon was 
operator of the Paris Carver well and holds a 50% interest in Blocks 
601 and 602; and also operated the Flathead well, and holds a 100% 
interest in Block 30.

Dominion Resources Expects 4th Quarter Costs 
    

    Dominion Resources had 4th quarter expenses of $348 million for 
losses from dealings with Enron and for a restructuring. The 
company's 2001 earnings, excluding some items, met or exceeded 
forecasts of $4.15 per share. The expenses include $97 million 
related to Enron, a $183 million write-off of Dominion Capital assets 
and $68 million from a restructuring. The Enron costs involve $6 
million for past sales to the energy trader and $91 million for the 
decline in value of forward natural gas contracts with Enron. 
Dominion expects profit this year of $4.90 - $4.95 per share. 
Earnings after 2002 should rise at an average annual rate of 10%, 
Dominion says.  Last November, Dominion cut its senior-management 
team by 19 officers, or 25%. Dominion has hedged more than 60% of its 
2002 natural gas production and 40% of its 2003 natural gas volume at 
prices above current market prices.

UBS to Restart EnronOnline

    Natural gas traders who did large volumes of business with Enron 
are taking a wait-and-see approach toward dealing with the new market 
player expected to emerge from the recent deal with Swiss bank, UBS. 
Some have their doubts about UBS' potential impact on the market. The 
deal calls for UBS to restart the trading business, including 
EnronOnline, with the help of 830 former Enron workers. However, even 
if the deal does get the  court's approval, there is still some 
question among marketers and traders as to whether a revitalized 
trading operation could recapture the dominant market share Enron 
held prior to bankruptcy.

President Urges Senate to Act on National Energy Plan  

    In an address in New Orleans, President Bush said that it was a 
matter of national security for the US to have a National Energy 
Package. The president urged the Senate, where energy legislation is 
currently stalled, to take immediate action to pass a National Energy 
Plan. The president's remarks come prior to Congress reconvening next 
week after the holiday recess. The White House, labor and business 
leaders support the development of resources in ANWR to increase 
energy independence, national security and create over 755,000 jobs. 
Opening the ANWR could double the current domestic supply of oil and 
make the US far less reliant on foreign sources for its energy needs. 
The US Geological Survey reports that the 1.5 million-acre tract 
holds upwards of 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil, which is the 
energy equivalent of 17.7 billion barrels of gasoline, enough to 
supply the total US gasoline demand for nearly 6 years. Arctic Power, 
an Alaskan-based non-profit organization that supports the opening of 
ANWR says that Congress has debated ANWR for over 14 years and now it 
is the responsibility of the Senate to face up to the realities of 
the present situation. The 2,000 acres of the ANWR designated for 
exploration could replace Iraqi imports for the next 70 years.

"RE: Needles Golf Tournament","Tiny,
	Thanks for the invitation. Due to Transwestern's financial situation and the need to limit all travel that is not absolutely essential, I will have to pass on this event. It sounds like it will be fun. I may schedule a trip later to visit the Red Rock facilities and meet with some customers. Thanks.

I got this information out a little late last year so here is a heads up.  The Needles 38th annual golf tournament is scheduled for the 5th and 6th of April.  The tournament involves Transwestern, SoCal, El Paso, PG&E, Soutwest etc....

Randy Williams (team leader for the Kingman team) can be contacted for additional information.  Also, Randy, would you please put Steve, Kim and Kevin on your distribution list for the golf registration flyers once they become available.  

Oh yea, if dollars are available we could use about 60 dozen golf balls or any items that you might like distributed during the tournament.  If you or someone from your group would like to tie the golf tournament into a quick tour of the Red Rock facilities let me know and I will coordinate those details.  Thanks

Julie, I currently do not utilize LIM on my desktop, however; in light of the changes with NNG/Dynegy, I believe that someone in my shop should have access to LIM.  We had been currently utilizing Kay Treat and Sean Bolks for LIM information.

Should we coordinate with you?

Please advise.

URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

Subject:	Bloomfield to Gallup Pigging - Pigging beginning 10/11/01

Plans were made for pigging from Bloomfield to Gallup at today's conference call.

Bisti is scheduled for up and down operation on Wednesday due to maintenance.  So the first pig run will be Thursday and consist of two squeege pigs. If the pigs are dry and clean at Gallup, the second run will be made next Monday.  If the pigs are not dry they will be transported back to Bloomfield on Thursday and launced on Friday.

Tiny - If I picked out the wrong team addresses, could you please forward this to the right teams?

If anyone knows of changes, please let me know.

Thanks,


John

Subject:	Bloomfield to Gallup Pigging - Tentatively planned for the week of October 8

The current plan is to pig Bloomfield to Gallup the week of October 8.  The main motivation for this was to wait until Ben is back in the office to monitor the efficiency data and results.

Please let me know if you would have any conflicts with a conference call for the afternoon of Monday, October 8 to finalize pigging plans.  I am leaning towards 2:00 p.m. CST right now.

Also, not everyone was able to make the call yesterday.  If you see a problem with pigging the week of October 8, please let me know.

Thanks,


John

Subject:	Bloomfield to Gallup Pigging

To recap past conversations, Bloomfield to Gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last February.  It is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig.  If this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity, re-application of the DRA will be considered.

How does pigging Bloomfield to Gallup the first week in October sound?  Darrell pointed out that would provide a week's run time on the Gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for September 29.

I suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig.  The afternoon of Monday, October 1, a conference call would be held.  If there were no complications with Gallup or any other issues, the pig run would be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday.

If you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Also please let me know if having the conference call at 2:00 p.m., CST, Monday, October 1, would work for you, and if not, then what time would be good.  I will plan on sending out the conference number and code next Monday, September 24.

Thanks,


John

"Power's fine for now","We saw the Pediatric Orthopedist today.  First I must say it was one of the 
most smoothly run Dr. visits I've been on.  We had an appointment at 1:30 and 
low and behold we were talking to the Dr. at 1:30!  The Dr. was also very 
nice.  He answer our questions without being arrogant and he spoke in plain 
English.  

Basically he said the modern theory was that half of the cases went away on 
their own, so we have an appointment in 3 months to check on Power  establish 
a trend line.  In the mean time he's free to do what he wants to but allowed 
to sit out if his hip bothers him, i.e.  self limiting kind of like my top 
speed on a bike.  If at 3 months its getting better, we continue the 
agressive treatment by visiting every 3 months.  If it is not getting better 
then we look at something more intrusive.  He explained the crutches and 
braces that used to be the normal treatment were more to slow the boys down 
than anything else and recent studies had not proven them that effective.  
Power is also allowed to take some Motrin or other over the counter pain 
medication if he wants.

The Dr. discouraged anything like cross country running, but emphasized 
keeping the joint exercised was good, so no couch potato.  The Dr. okayed the 
wheels so bike and skates are back on the menu.  Judy is going to sign him up 
for the Wednesday swim in the indoor pool at the park in Katy.

Hi Dot.

Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see 
what she says.

Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.

	Kim -- Do you know someone named Audrey Robertson?  She books the 49/C2 room.  I need to know if someone 
	turned in a purse and a briefcase this morning (left there).  And, if not, who booked that room after Stan's 8 am -9:30 
	staff meeting was over.

	(I've tried to call her; got her no. from Cindy Stark, but no answer.  I don't know if she is in today or not.  I went up to 
	49/C2 and no purse or briefcase is there.  Yes -- I am losing it!)

"Bonuses and Merit","Kim, here are my thoughts based on the pool available:

Bonus:
Lorraine		35,000	(40,000 last year)
TK		35,000	(23,000 last year)Note: She would only get 27,500 more because of the other 7,500 as part of the Danny deal.
Michelle	20,000  (8,700   last year which was prorated by one-half)
Mark		15,000
Paul		15,000

With these numbers, I will still need to go back to Danny and ask for an additional amount because I still need more for others in the group. Let's discuss this when you get a chance. I need to give the numbers to Danny and Fran by December 27.

Merit:
Lorraine		9.5% (This should bring Lorraine closer to the others).
TK		3%
Michelle	3%		
Mark		3%
Paul		3%

Kim, Mark listed below are the ETS Operations employees that will participate in the Southern Trails due diligence October 29th and 30th in Salt Lake City, Utah.

	L.D. Stephens - Team Leader/Operations
	Larry Campbell - Environmental
	???????? - ROW (To be determined by Johnny McGee and communicated directly to you)
	Mike Ames - Pipeline Safety

As discussed, these employees will arrive in Salt Lake, Sunday evening, October 28th prepared to go to the data room Monday 29th and Tuesday 30th.  They will return to their respective home locations Wednesday morning, October 31st.

Please provide a Questar contact person and address of the data room.  If you could also provide the name of a hotel close to the data room, it would be appreciated.
Names of other Enron parties participating in the due diligence and where they are staying would be helpful.  Any specific limitations imposed upon the data room review
should be communicated as soon as possible.

Morris Brassfield (Operations Support) and Jerry Martin (E&C) have determined that it is not necessary for them to have personnel attend the data room.  The operations team will retrieve as much information as possible to support their needs.  It was also my understanding no one from Planning and System Optimization would participate.

As I will be out of town the rest of the week, please communicate directly with these individuals via e mail.  If you need to need to contact me, I can be reached at 713-303-2764.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.  Each block of numbers will experience an outage of a few minutes during which calls made to an affected number will not go through and will not roll to voice mail.  The numbers affected are: 345-5000...6999; 713-646-6000...6599; 713-646-7000...7999; 713-646-8200...8399; 713-646-8600..8699; 713-646-9700...9799; 713-345-0200...2999.  The number 713-345-7000 to access voice mail will not be affected by this maintenance.  However, any number within these maintenance groups will be affected regardless of whether it was moved from 3AC.  This change will impact ETS users.

There will be no network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  If you need access to 3AC anytime Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information.  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access. 3AC Telco and Voicemail services will be unavailable during the outage period.

"FBI: Bin Laden may target Gas Industry","WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 - ""The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death"", news sources said Monday.

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies. 

""We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,"" said the memo, adding that the information was ""from a source of undetermined reliability."" 

The FBI warning continued that ""such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed."" 

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"GPCM News: 10/22/01: GPCM Customer Base Expands: RBAC in Houston: FERCto Reform Nominations","GPCM Customer Base Expands Again at PowerMart
 
Last week at the GPCM workshop at PowerMart, we were able to announce El
Paso Field Services as our 16th active GPCM licensee.  We also met with
another Houston energy company which has committed to its GPCM license
before the end of the year.  The icing on the cake occurred when we
returned home to Los Angeles to be greeted with another commitment to
license GPCM before the end of this year.  We are looking forward to
working with these new companies and to providing all of our licensees
with continuing excellence in GPCM training and support.
 
RBAC Returning to Houston Next Week
 
Bob Brooks will be in Houston next week for GPCM training and
demonstration.  There are time slots available on Thursday, November
1st.  If you would like to meet with Bob, please let him know by
replying to this mail or by calling him at 323-663-4831.
 
From http://www.enerfax.com <http://www.enerfax.com/> :
 
FERC Seeks Natural Gas Capacity Nomination Reform
 
Natural gas pipelines and customers have until November 19th to offer
comments on a plan by the FERC that would allow shippers to recall
released capacity and renominate the capacity. The FERC has stated in a
Federal Register notice that it seeks to change the natural gas business
rule to synchronize the its regulation of recalled capacity with its
standards for intra-day nominations. The changes are related to FERC's
open access regulation, and would also give transporters more
flexibility in transactions to release capacity. The proposed change
would rescind Gas Industry Standards Board provisions which require
notice of capacity release recalls by 8 a.m. central time and which ban
partial day recalls of capacity. The board developed its rules based on
a consensus of its gas pipeline members. Last February, the GISB asked
the FERC to clarify the rules because of confusion over whether partial
day recalls of capacity were a valid practice. The proposal would allow
releasing shippers to coordinate recalls of capacity release
transactions and renominations with the current intra-day nomination
cycle and recall rights would operate according to the same timelines
that now apply to interruptible transportation. The proposal also seeks
to create more competition for pipeline capacity with parity between
scheduling release transactions and scheduling of pipeline interruptible
service. Allowing shippers to recall capacity quickly means more
capacity would be released.

When this invoice was input, it was paid to Lea County Courthouse (5000042878) instead of Leaco Rural Telephone (5000019852).  I have a call into Micah to explain the situation and have her return the check.  Who takes care of voiding checks in Houston?  Please let me know, and I'll have her send it in.

Thanks

Tracey,

I received a phone call yesterday from  Mika Aswell (spelling?) from Lea County, NM.  Her county office has received a check from Transwestern and she does not know how to apply it.  Here is what we know:

	Amount:	$7.36
	Check Date:  	December 17, 2001
	Invoice Date:	1-1-2001	#676-3004-0
	Voucher:	0100001479
	Purchase Order:	A60KD13882

Mika's phone number is (505)396-8534.

Can you please track this down and tell me or Mika how to apply this money.

Many thanks, 
Kim X33098

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Steve,

Well, TK celebrated 20 years with Enron on January 11.  I did talk with Fran about the status of service awards, and of course, they were suspended in December.  Fran said that they are having discussions about what to do in the future.  It may be a while before this program gets reinstated (if at all).  Until it does, may we go ahead and plan a lunch or something nice for TK?

I think we're a go for the May/June time frame.  Kim was supposed to

Maybe we can rally late afternoon on Sunday to get this ball rolling.

I'm not sure how clear Judy was when Kim ask if we liked IT in late
May/early June as opposed to Sept.

Our baby-sitter options are much greater when kids are out of school.
Sept
wipes out Judy's Mom because she can't leave Ft. Worth and puts us in
competition with Jo Lynn (Mom has a trip to Guam sometime in the Fall)

Both are possible, but wanted to make sure you understood it was not 6
of 1
half dozen of another.

In training this week.  Only E-mailing on breaks.

Power and I at Battleship Texas Saturday.  Not sure what we're up to
Sunday.

"GPCM News: 1/8/02: Mackenzie Delta Gas Progress: Islander East GetsPrelim Approval","From http://www.enerfax.com <http://www.enerfax.com/> :

 

Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas Project Files for Approval

  

   A consortium of major oil companies have moved closer to 

developing almost 6 Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region 

on the coast of the Beaufort Sea. The group has begun the lengthy 

process of applying for regulatory approval, which could take up to 4 

years. Led by Imperial Oil, the group consists of Conoco, Shell 

Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a company controlled by 

Northwest Territories native people. The partners, known as the 

Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250 million 

before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The natural 

gas reserves would be produced from Imperial's 3 Tcf Taglu field, the 

1.8 Tcf Parsons Lake field, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and 

Shell's 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline 

to carry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Alberta along the 

Mackenzie River valley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The 

natural gas would then be transported to Canada and the US. Last 

year, the group signed an agreement with Northwest Territories native 

leaders that would give the region's people a 33% share in the 

pipeline and provide other economic benefits. Even if the Mackenzie 

Delta project did not start pumping for 5 or 6 years, it likely will 

still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where BP, Exxon Mobil and 

Phillips are planning development of their reserves.

"RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding","I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

Salomon Forecast Cold Winter
This winter will likely rank in the top third of the coldest in history
for the US, according to the winter forecast by Salomon Smith Barney.
However, the odds do not point to an exceptionally cold winter, such as
one of the top 10 coldest, but that is not totally out of the question.
The forecast is based on a switch in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in
the northern Pacific Ocean from a warm phase for sea surface
temperatures, which tends to encourage mild winters, to a cold phase,
which raises the likelihood of a colder-than-normal winter. Combined
with neutral sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean in
a year that did not feature an El Nino or La Nina weather anomaly and an
adequate pool of cold air in the northern hemisphere, conditions are
similar to those prevailing before last winter. Last week, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration winter forecast called for
temperatures to be colder than normal in the Northeast, Upper Midwest,
Great Lakes and Great Plains States, with heavy snow in many of the same
areas.

"GPCM News: 10/19/01: Cal to Renegotiate Power Deals?: New Path 15Powerline: El Paso to Buy Arctic LNG: Colder Than Average Winter Predicted:Deep Gas Conference"," 
From http://www.enerfax.com <http://www.enerfax.com/> :
 
California Wants to Renegotiate Power Contracts 
 
California's governor says he is working on proposals that could result
in negotiations with power suppliers to reduce the cost of power being
purchased by the state through long-term power purchase contracts signed
earlier this year. However, none of the generators reportedly have heard
anything concerning renegotiations of the deals. While the state would
gain lower rates for power from any renegotiations, the advantage to the
power providers is not certain, other than the avoidance of future legal
or regulatory challenges to the contracts. The governor has come under
intense criticism from critics charging that the contracts lock the
state into prices that are way too high. The California PUC wants the
FERC to force the generators to lower their prices. How FERC will act on
the deals remains to be seen. Sempra signed a 10-year, 1,900-MW deal
with the state in May that could be worth $7 billion. Sempra began 250
MW deliveries this summer and expects increase output under the deal
over the next several years as it brings new power online. The contract
includes variable prices based on the cost of natural gas. With gas
prices at about $2 per MMBtu, Sempra is able to sell the state baseload
capacity at $0.041 per kWh and peaking capacity at $0.051 per kWh. 
 
New Path 15 Power Line to Be Built 
 
PG&E and other power companies will build a new $300 million
transmission line along Path 15, an 84-mile stretch of power lines in
the central part of California. The outdated transmission lines in the
area do not have enough capacity to carry electricity between the
northern and southern parts of the state during peak demand periods.
Expanding Path 15 to include a 3rd power line would boost transmission
by about 1,500 MW. The project could be completed by summer 2004. Kinder
Morgan, Williams, Trans-Elect, and the Western Area Power Administration
are also involved in the project.
 
For more information, see the LA Times article at
http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-000083333oct19.story .
 
El Paso and Iberdrola to Buy LNG from Snoehvit Project
 
The Snoehvit consortium, led by Norways Statoil has signed deals with El
Paso and Spanish Iberdrola to supply LNG from the Arctic for 17-20
years. El Paso will buy 2.4 Billion cubic meters of gas per year, while
Iberdrola will purchase 1.6 Bcm for a total of $453.8 million per year.
Snoehvit will also sell volumes totaling 1.7 Bcm to partners Gaz de
France and TotalFinaElf. Snoehvit, estimated to hold 320 Bcm of gas will
be developed as a subsea tie-back to a LNG plant near the world's
northernmost city Hammerfest. The LNG will be transported by specialized
carriers to the US and Europe. In the US, the LNG will be sold at spot
prices. Environmentalists oppose Snoehvit, the first development in the
Arctic Barents Sea, because of potential ecological damage. The deals
were signed under a condition that the Norwegian parliament approves the
project. A new political party is set to take over Norways government
today and may postpone Snoehvit in order to make further environmental
impact studies. Otherwise, construction is scheduled to begin by spring
2002 and be operational by autumn of 2006.
 
NOAA Winter Weather Forecast
 
Colder than average temperatures will prevail this winter in the
Northeast, Upper Midwest, Great Lakes and Great Plains states, according
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA says that
the absence of El Nino and La Nina could lead to heavy snow in the
Midwest and along the East Coast. The forecast does not expect a repeat
of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November and December of
last year, but winter should still be colder than normal. The Pacific
Northwest had near-record dry conditions last winter that depleted
hydropower severely, but will have more normal weather this year. Texas,
Oklahoma, and the western parts of Arkansas and Louisiana will receive
above average rain while Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and the
eastern part of North Carolina will be dryer than usual. 
 
Deep Gas Conference in Houston
 
The Strategic Research Institute is holding a conference on deep gas
technology on November 27-28 in Houston.  For more information, see the

Subject:	Indicated Shippers

I just received a voice mail from Kathy Edwards, attorney for Indicated Shippers.  She said her clients were not willing to ""carve-out"" the two issues of competitive bidding and scheduling rights for the Commission to decide as separate policy issues.  Indicated shippers said both issues have to be a part of a settlement.

Based on the input I have received from TW thus far, Indicated Shippers demands may make a settlement impossible.  We need to consider whether TW is willing to go further in regard to either or both of the Indicated Shippers positions (so far TW has said no).  Additionally thought should be given to whether appointment of a settlement judge at this time might be helpful.

I will try to get a call set up to discuss.  In the mean time, any feedback you have would be helpful.  Greg

Subject:	K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

"FW: Low Load GRI changes for 2002","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Bianchi, Rita  
Sent:	Wednesday, November 21, 2001 5:37 PM
To:	Gracey, Rosemary; Zadow, Raetta
Cc:	Kirk, Steve; Winckowski, Michele; Darveaux, Mary; Williams, John
Subject:	Low Load GRI changes for 2002

Rosemary - Please forward to everyone in Marketing'
Raetta - Please forward to everyone in Gas Logistics.

The GRI rates will change, effective January 1,2002
Commodity changes from .0070 to .0055
High Load Reservation GRI (default) changes from .090 to .066
Low Load Reservation GRI changes from .0550 to .0407
Small Customer GRI (GS-T contracts) changes from .0110 to .0088

Marketers:
As the attached letter explains, I have redetermined which shippers are considered ""Low Load"" for the coming year.
The changes from Low to High or High to Low are listed in the letter.  A few customers flip-flop from year to year.  If any of your customers are affected, please advise them before January Reservation invoices go out (February 1, 2002).  NNG files a tariff change for the new rates, but does not file or mail out any notices about changes in a shipper's high/low load status.
 

John Williams/Gas Logistics - FYI.  The spreadsheet lists legal entities that are in the High Load or Low Load categories for 2002.
If a shipper is not listed, then it will default to the High Load GRI rate.

 
Call if you have questions.

"Back Home - John did you see the game?","Power enjoyed fishing and boating all week with Grandpa and Renee while Judy, 
Paul and Marydith flew to Atlanta.  Marydith's first flight.  The good news 
is there's nothing much to say about her flying.  Also not much of any delays 
due to extra security.  Not to be unpatriotic but I think a few of the new 
rules are the same ones the airlines have been trying to pass for a while but 
couldn't until they could claim security.  

Savannah was nice.  Kind of like our weekend last Oct in Arkansas.  Lots of 
old buildings and tourist type shops.  

Judy is gearing up for the big bash on Bolivar next weekend.  The kids and I 
have not made any definite plans.

In a no where else but TX story.  I rode my bike tonight out through the 
flood plain.  I came across a small herd of cows.  The half on the left got 
startled and ran across the bike path and the group on the right crossed the 
other way so I ended up looking like the slot man on the Blue Angels as I 
emerged from the crossing cows.  Having had fun on the way South I realized 
the only way home at night is back North on the same path so about 10 minutes 
later I come back to find the bull standing across the path.  Remembering the 
old adage normally said about dogs ""Speed is Life"" I played chicken with him 
keeping the option open to cut behind him.  He blinked and moved off the 
path.  

John, any plans for next weekend?

Hi Dot.

Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see 
what she says.

Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.

	Kim -- Do you know someone named Audrey Robertson?  She books the 49/C2 room.  I need to know if someone 
	turned in a purse and a briefcase this morning (left there).  And, if not, who booked that room after Stan's 8 am -9:30 
	staff meeting was over.

	(I've tried to call her; got her no. from Cindy Stark, but no answer.  I don't know if she is in today or not.  I went up to 
	49/C2 and no purse or briefcase is there.  Yes -- I am losing it!)

"Summary of Commission Meeting","At the October 24, 2001, FERC Sunshine meeting, the following items were discussed:

Kern River Firm Customers' Rehearing Request Denied (C-6, C-8 on agenda):

Called by Linda Breathitt, these are two Kern River expansion applications [CA. Action Project, CP01-69; 2002 Expansion, CP01-106] that have received certificates.  The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers who charge that additions will cause further  pro rata allocations at Wheeler Ridge.  The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh ""any potential adverse impact to existing customers?"" and that ""the solution to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with interstate pipelines, but with resolving the problems of take-away capacity on SoCalGas?.""  Hence, the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its obligations to its customers, and the current lack of intrastate capacity ""cannot be laid at [Kern River's] door.""

Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the important issue of FERC's response to intervener allegations of insufficient take-away capacity related to interstate expansions.  Though Breathitt doesn't dissent from the rehearing denial, she wants to underscore the importance of the Commissions' acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation of existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessity for pipeline expansions.  She also states that she is ""uneasy"" about FERC's ""strident policies"" in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite possible inefficiencies and constraints, and she reiterates that FERC's mandate under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground.  She notes that the Commission will revisit the take-away capacity issue in another Kern River expansion application, CP01-422 [2003 Expansion Project].

Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Auspice of ""Electricity Market Design and Structure"" NOPR, RM01-12 (E-5 on agenda)

Though  the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent, under this discussion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other three Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure to coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions.  The need for such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state commissioners during RTO Week.  To get this process going, Commissioner Brownell asked staff to pursue a structure, perhaps a type of regional panel, with the mission to strengthen federal/sate relationships.  Considering the magnitude of RTO development, FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff work on this.  Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp, Director of OMTR, bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement a structure.  While all three other Commissioners supported Brownell's proposal, Commissioner Massey noted that there's already been seven years of ""process"" and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be developed ""in a way that gets us to an endgame"" concretely and clearly.

Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in Seattle

Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material gathered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next month's Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November 2 [similar conferences will be held regionally across the country].    The conference is a FERC ""fact-finding mission"" which will seek to answer three primary questions:
(1)		Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate?
(2)	What are the infrastructure needs for the region?
(3)	What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy infrastructure?

While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission, the conference will cover all energy delivery systems.  The overriding question on all fronts is what needs to be done, and who needs to do it.  The powerpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERC's website at <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/discussion_papers.htm>
 
""RTO Week"" Update 

Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held at FERC last week.  Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining ""what Staff heard,"" which will be posted on FERC's website this week.  The document is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders.  Staff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller, more focused Staff sessions to ""dig deeper?.""  According to Staff, while there seemed to be some consensus at the 10.000 mile high level, more specific issues emerged which may require further discussion.

Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations (Southeast, Northeast), Midwest RTO Progress

In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases, Staff and the mediating Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off, what proposals and options are now on the table, and what next steps may be necessary.  These mediation reports will be available online (by end of week).  What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs - there were no votes at the meeting, only discussion.

In the Midwest, both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations, and MISO and SPP are also prepared to merge.  While Commissioners discussed specifics of all the Midwest proposals, again no vote was taken or any indication given as to when a vote may occur.

ETS Draft Orders Issued:

?	Northern Natural, RP00-223-005:  Northern's Limited Firm Transportation [""LFT""] tariff sheets were approved, including two additional LFT sheets concerning the Carlton surcharge.
?	Calypso, CP01-444-000:  Letters issued to Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense requesting review of draft Presidential Permit for Calypso to construct, own and operate pipeline facilities at the boundary of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] and the Bahamas EEZ.

"FERC Approves Sempra's North Baja Pipeline","FERC Approves North Baja Pipe 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. 
The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. 
FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. 
If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer. Work has been underway for some time on the longer, Mexican portion of the line which runs from Yuma, AZ, near the Mexican border to the Rosarito Beach area south of Tijuana in the northwest corner of Baja.

A finished product won't be complete until such time as elevations are verified along the new pipeline route.  Topogaphical maps are required to complete this portion of the study.  Once this is completed and studies run, that product will be reviewed by the Planning team and System Optimization team.  Studies will be based on the results of the open season and the volumes anticipated by Marketing. Expansion facilities will be adjusted based on those results and finished porduct produced.

We have a procedure in place with Planning that any Level B estimates that are major expansion projects, such as this, require at least one month to complete, after we have a defined scope of work from Planning.

Kevin, we realize your goals, but for us to do a proper Level B with all of our due diligences, it won't be ready before Sept. 29th, at the earliest.  Especially if the hydraulics(which are part of the scope) aren't done until after Sept. 12th from Planning. Thanks, Norm

Kevin 
I'll need to fly the routes and assess the terrain conditions. I plan to do this on Sept 11&12 
Ron will need to run the hydraulics on the various options. 
We both then need to agree on the most favourable option and do the Level B estimate based on the preferred route and the required line sizes and compression requirements

I think the earliest we can have the Level B complete is Sept 21

Guys, we'll need to get the Level 'B' cost estimates put together as soon as possible in order to send out binding contracts to customers.  I can't comfortably send out binding contracts with transportation rates still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience what your timing is for the Level B.

Ron/Kevin 

Based on scaling the topo maps I have, the following are the lengths for each of the segments we discussed. 

Transwestern Mainline- 36"" Loop 

Compressor Station #2 to El Paso Take Off Point - 33.6 miles or say  34 miles 

New Lateral- 30"" or 36"" 

A  Compressor Station #2 to Phoenix Storage Cavern  along I- 17 Highway route -  144 miles + 5% contingency  or say 151 miles


B El Paso Take Off Point to Phoenix Storage Cavern along El Paso Pipeline route - 120 miles + 5% contingency or say 126 miles

In summary, the New Lateral using the El Paso route is 25 miles shorter in what appears to be easier terrain, but will require the 34 mile extension on the Transwestern loop.


I will flly both routes on Sept 11 and examine any other options from the air. 
I will drive as much of the routes as I can on Sept 12 and evaluate on the ground the soil/rock conditions. 
After this asessement, we can zero in on the most cost effective option and route to pursue. 
Call me if you have any questions

"TransCanada Announces Export Expansion into Northwest and California Markets Named Westpath Expansion","Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that ""if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade."" 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the ""project definition phase,"" or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it ""recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas.""

THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS 

By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced 
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out 
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the 
holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine 
without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate 
second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, 
they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your 
favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think 
so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. 
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you 
follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to 
New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. 

1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on 
   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In 
   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where 
   they're serving rum balls. 

2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine 
   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than 
   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. 
   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's 
   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. 
   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than 
   you think. It's Christmas! 

3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of 
   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill 
   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. 

4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk 
   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a 
   sports car with an automatic transmission. 

5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control 
   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? 

6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. 
   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the 
   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
   eggnog. 

7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like 
   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position 
   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before 
   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of 
   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them 
   again. 

8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. 
   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one 
   dessert? Labor Day? 

9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the 
   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, 
   have some standards, mate. 

10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the 
    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. 
    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just 
    around the corner.

"PNM Terminates Merger with Western Resources","Executive News:

PNM terminates merger with Western Resources

Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources announced Tuesday its board had
officially killed the proposed deal to buy Western Resources' electric
utility subsidiaries. The deal, originally valued at over $4 billion, had
been in trouble for months, and each side sued the other in state court in
New York. PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec. 31 under the
terms of the deal, if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards
completing the transaction. But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to
back out of the deal. PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the
deal alleging breach of contract, in part because of adverse rulings from
the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) on rates and a Western restructuring
plan considered vital to the transaction.

Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later, seeking at least $650
million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion, breach of contract,
sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings. Neither case has
been decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western's
case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNM's initial suit.
Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a planned restructuring in
preparation for the PNM transaction to a Kansas district court. Western

"NOAA Weather Forecast Released","Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
""We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s,"" said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. ""Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather."" 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
""This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather,"" said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

"Procedures for Transwestern Gas Control/Marketing Morning Meetings","The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 25, 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.

Natural Gas Futures Tumble Below $2


     Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled 
6.3% yesterday, falling $0.129 to $1.908 per MMBtu. The March 
contract lost $0.12 to $1.984 per MMBtu. The market opened lower 
yesterday morning and soon dropped below $2. It was the lowest price 
seen since last September's $1.83 per MMBtu expiration for the 
October contract. In afternoon trading prices dipped as low as $1.85 
on a bearish weather forecast, but quickly recovered to finish the 
session on an up-tick. Physical prices were kept up by cooler weather 
in the Mid-continent region. Cold weather in the West also pushed up 
cash prices there, but only marginally. The AGA report to be released 
tomorrow afternoon is expected to show a withdrawal of about 110 ? 
120 Bcf. Look for the cash market to follow the NYMEX downward today, 
although weather concerns in the nation's midsection reflect a slight 
bullishness. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and 
Canada was generally flat to down $0.05 yesterday. Natural gas for 
next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.01 to $2.02 per MMBtu.

Enron's Due on Enron Wind Sale

    Bids for Enron Wind were due yesterday, as the profitable company 
is expected to soon be sold to European owners. Five companies are in 
the running, so it is likely to take Enron several weeks to announce 
a buyer. The purchase price is likely to be about $500 million. Enron 
Wind is making money and is not included in Enron's bankruptcy 
filing. Its revenues jumped from about $50 million when it was 
acquired by Enron in 1997 to $750 million in 2001. Last year was by 
far the best year in the company's history. The bankruptcy court will 
have to provide some kind of oversight for the sale of any Enron 
material assets. Likely bidders are Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems, 
German-Danish wind turbine maker Nordex AG, General Electric and some 
financial groups from Europe. Enron Wind will likely end up bought by 
the Europeans, who have a stronger presence in the wind energy 
sector. The top 5 wind turbine manufacturers are three Danish, one 
Spanish, and one German. Vestas plans to set up a blade and assembly 
plant in the US if the tax credit is extended, and NEG Micon already 
has an assembly plant here. More than 1,000 MW of projects have been 
put on hold in the US because the tax credit has yet to be renewed. 
About $5 billion of new wind power was installed worldwide last year, 
bringing the total over $20 billion.

PanCanadian and Alberta Energy Merge
 
    PanCanadian Energy and Alberta Energy have reached an agreement 
to merge, forming one of the top independent oil and natural gas 
company in the world in terms of proved reserves, production and 
value. The share swap deal will create a C$27 billion exploration and 
production company with operations in the US, the North Sea and 
Ecuador and major Canadian-based operations. The newly merged company 
will be called EnCana Corporation. The top executives of each company 
plan to enhance the market value and prevent a takeover of either 
firm. Canadian energy companies have historically experienced a lower 
stock market value than US rivals in terms of multiples of projected 
cash flow per share, used to measure the value of companies. Some say 
that pension funds looking to invest in North America exploration 
would not have considered the companies before because they were too 
small, but the new company is large enough to attract institutional 
investors. It has been estimated that EnCana could eventually have a 
multiple of 7.75 to 8.75 times cash flow, suggesting a target price 
of C$44.50 to C$52.00. Competitors Anadarko and Burlington Resources 
currently trade at 9.7 times and 8.7 times respectively. As part of 
the deal, AEC stockholders will receive 1.472 PanCanadian shares for 
each of their shares, which values AEC at about C$9 billion. 
PanCanadian had been mentioned as a takeover target when it was spun 
off from Canadian Pacific last fall. The deal carries a C$350 million 
break up fee for either firm should it cause the merger to fall 
through.

Enron Collapse May Have Ripple Effect 
 

    The ripple effect caused by the collapse of Enron may have harmed 
securities across a broad range of asset classes. Revelations about 
Enron's murky financial statements have generally cast doubt on 
corporate accounting practices. Some say that the stock market now 
carries a higher equity risk premium because of Enron's collapse. In 
some cases, investors who lose money in one market unwound their 
exposure in others, leading to a spiral of forced selling. Even 
companies with no Enron exposure are experiencing investor risk 
aversion equal to those that had direct financial dealings with the 
company. For example, Kmart would likely not have been vulnerable to 
energy sector risks in the past. But Kmart claimed that insurers had 
raised premiums for surety bonds, which Kmart needed to cover certain 
contingent liabilities. Enron's collapse also worried investors about 
other energy companies, like Calpine, El Paso and Mirant, forcing 
them to adjust their balance sheets. The fallout from Enron likely 
led to a downturn in outstanding commercial and industrial loans over 
the past month. Another sign of potential contagion effects is a $266 
million outflow from high yield bond funds last week was attributed 
by to fears aroused by the Enron and Kmart bankruptcies. Each new 
Enron disclosure fuels fears that the economy is threatened by the 
fallout. And, whether actual contagion exists or not, fear of it 
seems to led many companies' to distance themselves from the energy 
trader.

California PUC Urged to Shift Power Choice Date
  
    An administrative law judge to the California PUC has urged the 
regulators to amend a ruling that jettisoned the right of customers 
to choose their electricity provider. The ALJ says the ruling needed 
to be changed because it unfairly shifted almost $2 billion of costs 
to utility customers. To avoid penalizing the customers, the ALJ 
recommends that the PUC set July 1st as the cutoff date for energy 
users to sign new direct access contracts to buy electricity from 
independent companies. The CPUC voted last September to cancel the 
customer choice option as of that date. Without the change in dates, 
consumers who continued to take power from their local utility will 
be responsible for $1.98 billion. That is because from July 1st to 
September 20th last year, about 11% of the total electric service of 
the state's investor-owned utilities shifted from bundled service 
from the utilities to direct access service from other companies. 
About 10,000 businesses signed the new power deals last summer when 
wholesale electricity priced dropped, a move severely criticized by 
state consumer groups. However, the PUC reserved the option to shift 
the cutoff date back to July 1st if the Sept 20th date hurt customers 
who stayed with their utility.

MARKET OUTLOOK

 Hold on to the short position in the March natural gas futures. The 
GasTrader model is still in a bearish mode and continues to stay 
short, although no new trades are recommended. Prices continue in a 
pervasive downtrend, yet stop loss provisions are in place to guard 
against any unexpected price rallies.  The massive short interest 
held by non commercial accounts is of concern, but the stop loss 
provisions of the model are designed to cope with what economists 
call ""exogenous variables"". Weather, storage, and the economy are all 
negative, and combined with the unfavorable technical environment 
suggest that prices could work  still lower. GasTrader Consultant is 
a natural gas futures trading program designed to minimize the 
opportunity costs (losses) that often result under the best 
intentioned but often misguided hedging programs. Specific trading 
parameters are in place daily and trades are executed on the close or 
at predetermined trading points.  Results assume positions are 
maintained in the spot (most liquid) futures contract and are rolled 
over on the 16th of the month prior to contract expiration.  If the 
program is in a long mode producers and physical market longs would 
lift all hedges.  Conversely if the program is in a short mode end 
users would lift their hedges. If the model is flat or neutral, a 
conservative strategy requires hedging by both long and short market 
participants.  It is believed that by combining natural gas price 
trends with hedging requirements opportunity costs can be minimized 
and greater participation in market moves can be realized. Hedging 
costs are synchronized with the market.

Subject:	Oasis Dairy Farms Judgement

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Kinder Morgan Moving Ahead with Advantage Pipeline

 

Gas Daily reports that Kinder Morgan is planning to go ahead with its
previously announced Advantage Pipeline, which would connect the
Cheyenne Hub with points in Eastern Kansas.  KM would also expand its 8
bcf storage Huntsman storage facility near Cheyenne Hub to about 14 bcf.
Advantage would be built with an initial capacity of 330 mmcfd and could
be expanded to 450 per day as coalbed methane production in Wyoming
increased.  The pipe is planned to be operational by late 2004.

Westchester County, NY Battles Millennium Pipeline

  

Westchester County, north of New York City, will petition the 

FERC to reconsider its decision to permit Columbia Gas to build the 

530-mile Millennium pipeline from Ontario to Mount Vernon, NY. The 

pipeline would transport 700,000 Mcf per day to New York City and 

southern parts of the state. The county alleges that the FERC 

prematurely granted Columbia's request to build the pipeline. They 

say that Columbia does not have the needed state approvals to proceed 

with construction and that the company did not provide crucial 

information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally 

sensitive areas in the Hudson River. A FERC study found that the 

pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the 

preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York. The 

commission has 30 days to respond to the county's petition. If 

denied, Westchester can then seek a court order to block 

construction. The county has asked several state regulatory 

departments to deny future approvals and cancel existing permits 

already granted. Westchester will also refuse to grant Columbia 

permits for construction on county land. Additionally, the county is 

questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to protect 

coastal areas from environmental damage. Federal law prohibits a 

federal agency from granting approval for projects that affect the 

coastline if a state finds it violates its own coastal plan. In 

addition, county officials have asked the governor to intervene when 

he attends a FERC conference later this month.

 

Canadian Drilling to Drop this Year 

 

The Petroleum Services Association of Canada says that Western 

Canadian producers expect to cut drilling by 26% this year and 

natural gas will continue to dominate exploration activity. It 

predicts 13,386 wells will be drilled in western Canada, down from 

last year's record 18,024. Natural gas will account for 8,189, or 

61%, of its forecast well completions this year. PSAC expects 10,309 

wells to be drilled in Alberta, down 26% from 2001; 2,323 wells in 

Saskatchewan, a 25% drop; and 674 in northeastern British Columbia, 

down 29%. There were 11,177 natural gas completions last year in the 

Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, with another 26 natural gas wells 

drilled in the East Coast offshore.

"Infrastructure Announcements: Transco, Petal Gas Storage, ANR's Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier","Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
""The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market,"" FERC said in its draft order. ""Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate."" 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, ""given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California."" 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was ""extremely successful,"" adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
""The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States,"" said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
""We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region,"" said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
""Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. ""We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for October 21, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   There is a story told in Buddhism of a monk who was fleeing a tiger. 
He ran to the edge of a cliff and, being unable to stop himself, went 
over the edge. He caught the branch of a tree on his way down. He 
looked down and way below on the ground was another tiger. He glanced 
aside and saw a strawberry on a bush growing from the edge of the cliff 
beside him. He let go of the limb with one hand, picked the strawberry 
and savored it.

   This story is told as an example of the ability to enjoy a true 
present.

   But how can we do that when our experience is that our lives are 
falling apart?

   Our lives are really no different than they were prior to 9/11. What 
is different is that we see the reality of ""what is"" a bit better. 
True, these are difficult times. I'm inviting you to come to the 
Ordinary Life Gathering this Sunday. What I want to offer is comfort 
and suggestions on not just how to survive our present circumstances 
but how to thrive in the midst of the places that scare us.

   I look forward to seeing you then.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

======================================

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an 
enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present 
moment.

The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at 
St. Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. 
Bill Kerley. If you would like more information -
