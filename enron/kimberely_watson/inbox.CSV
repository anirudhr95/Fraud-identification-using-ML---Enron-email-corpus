"TW's Firm Capacity Procedures","Attached is the current version of TW's Firm Capacity Procedures.  (Posting requirements are defined in another document.)  These procedures outline the definitions of certificated/sustainable, operational/short-term sustainable and operational non-sustainable capacity and how we will determine how much and when capacity is available in each of these categories.

I thought I would go ahead and distribute this because there have been some questions - though I understand some of the recent FERC rulings may require us to change the procedures as it concerns, among other things, whether operational/short-term sustainable capacity is sold under LFT vs. daily under FTS-1.

Hi Guys!
We're having a small amount of trouble finding a hotel in Rome on the front 
end.  So I'm going to ratchet the price level up somewhat.  If anyone has a 
problem with that - let me know.  (But be aware, you will be asked to name 
that tune and make the long distance phone calls.)
Also - to Paul and Judy - the Sheraton near the airport was full for the 
tailend of the trip.  So I'm still looking for something near the airport 
for October 11 for the 4 of us.
Also - to Kim - will send passport #'s later.  I haven't been by the bank to

pick up Dennis' passport yet.
Talk to you later,
Janell

"RE: Sun Devil Pipeline Lengths","To All:
I was very optimistic in my target of getting the Level B estimate ready by Sept 21.
Based on the amount of work that will need to be done to get a decent +/- 10% estimate, I agree with Norm's assessment and therefore the best we can hope for is a Sept 29/01 completion.
We will endeavor to do our best.
Thank You

Subject: RE: Sun Devil Pipeline Lengths


A preliminary model has been developed based on the limited information Doug, Kevin, and I discussed yesterday.  A finished product won't be complete until such time as elevations are verified along the new pipeline route.  Topogaphical maps are required to complete this portion of the study.  Once this is completed and studies run, that product will be reviewed by the Planning team and System Optimization team.  Studies will be based on the results of the open season and the volumes anticipated by Marketing. Expansion facilities will be adjusted based on those results and finished porduct produced.

We have a procedure in place with Planning that any Level B estimates that are major expansion projects, such as this, require at least one month to complete, after we have a defined scope of work from Planning.

Kevin, we realize your goals, but for us to do a proper Level B with all of our due diligences, it won't be ready before Sept. 29th, at the earliest.  Especially if the hydraulics(which are part of the scope) aren't done until after Sept. 12th from Planning. Thanks, Norm

Kevin 
I'll need to fly the routes and assess the terrain conditions. I plan to do this on Sept 11&12 
Ron will need to run the hydraulics on the various options. 
We both then need to agree on the most favourable option and do the Level B estimate based on the preferred route and the required line sizes and compression requirements

I think the earliest we can have the Level B complete is Sept 21

Guys, we'll need to get the Level 'B' cost estimates put together as soon as possible in order to send out binding contracts to customers.  I can't comfortably send out binding contracts with transportation rates still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience what your timing is for the Level B.

Ron/Kevin 

Based on scaling the topo maps I have, the following are the lengths for each of the segments we discussed. 

Transwestern Mainline- 36"" Loop 

Compressor Station #2 to El Paso Take Off Point - 33.6 miles or say  34 miles 

New Lateral- 30"" or 36"" 

A  Compressor Station #2 to Phoenix Storage Cavern  along I- 17 Highway route -  144 miles + 5% contingency  or say 151 miles


B El Paso Take Off Point to Phoenix Storage Cavern along El Paso Pipeline route - 120 miles + 5% contingency or say 126 miles

In summary, the New Lateral using the El Paso route is 25 miles shorter in what appears to be easier terrain, but will require the 34 mile extension on the Transwestern loop.


I will flly both routes on Sept 11 and examine any other options from the air. 
I will drive as much of the routes as I can on Sept 12 and evaluate on the ground the soil/rock conditions. 
After this asessement, we can zero in on the most cost effective option and route to pursue. 
Call me if you have any questions

Subject:	RE: FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points

As I understand/interpret the Gallup contract, we can completely avoid electrical power demand charges (approximately $42,000 per month) if we do not run the unit during the power utilities peak power period.  If we can not shut down the unit, we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period.

Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day (5-7 PM), Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day.  Through access to Tri-States history data, I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be.  I can look at the current day's usage and estimate if today's peak will be higher than the higher of (1) my estimated peak or (2) the actual peak so far this month.  If so, the ""Probability today is a peak"" will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today.   The ""Probability now is peak"" approached 100 when an actual peak is underway.  The Tri-State Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway.

Note that it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak.  If the first day of the month has an estimated peak 1000 and last years peak for the same month, was 985.  It appears possible that this will be a power peak day.  Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was 1010.  Now on the second day of the month, the estimated peak is 965, not likely to be a power peak day.  The third day has an estimated peak of 1005, a possible power peak day.  If the actual for the third day is 1012, it now becomes the new peak for the month.  If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below 1012, they are not likely to be power peaks, and unit turndown is not required.

The point is, to completely avoid demand charges, we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month, and also on the third day.  The utility integrates their peak over a 30 minute period, thus the minimum time the unit could be down.  I'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month.

So far this month, I guessed a power peak on 10/1/01 starting at 20:18 and ending at 21:05.  The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was 10/1/01 starting at 20:30 lasting to 21:00.


I'm sorry for any confusion.  I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators.  If there are any additional questions, do not hesitate to call me at 87-7546.

Rich / Rick,

Operations & the Gas Controllers didn't know about this till yesterday, when alarms started to appear in Houston.
I'm not sure what is expected from operations. In the last paragraph of Gary's letter, he indicates shutting down
for 30 minutes, 7 times a month. Is that what he is saying? Let us know what you find out.

Thanks,
Korey

Subject:	FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points



We have added some point to the Scada database that are provided to us
by Gary Choquette's Peak Power Predictor.  His message below describes
their function better than I would.

I've listed the points below with their descriptions, alarm value(s) and
comment.

Although these points are listed with the other Analog/Discrete points,
they are not coming from the field RTU.  They will act like normal
points so it's easy to put them together.  For those using the intranet
""Adhoc"" reports, they will show up on that.  The key is that the
Discretes that we receive from Gary all end in "".CC"" and the Analogs end
in "".SC"".  We also try to include the (CLC) in the description to depict
that the information is coming from the Closed Loop Control Systems.


Register	Description				Alarm Value
Gary's Comments

GALP.1901.CC	Tri-State Data Old - site Unavail (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Alarm 		(can not retrieve data from Tri-States site)
GALP.1902.CC	Tri-State Calc Off-Line / Data Error (CLC) 	0 =
Normal, 1 = Alarm 		(utility is off-line or error in the
data)
GALP.1903.CC 	Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Peak 		(a power peak is currently in progress)

GALP.7901.SC	Probability % Today is Peak (CLC)     HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that today is likely to be a power
peak day.
GALP.7902.SC  Probability % Now is Peak (CLC)       HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that a power peak is active now.

Subject:	SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Subject:	RE: Two proceeding changes

Christi --  I don't think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 either, and we are proceeding under the same schedule.  Several rehearing requests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES.  However, note the following which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercial and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without reading it.)  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this OMB ruling a good sign.  


As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market"" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, ""include an explicit discussion"").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when ""commenters"" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way.  OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after ""consulting with respondents"", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sends a signal!

"FW: Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles","The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

Subject:	Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.

Subject: Rome Hotel - Respond immediately please


Hey guys and girls,

Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end
of the trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center
looking for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate
response from the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.
I believe it is a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they
charge).  From the article in my book, they have recently remodeled.
They are located near our Hotel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and
Plaza Del Popolo.  The rate is 430,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's
$25 more than the Sheraton but we won't have to taxi between the city
center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to
easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in
town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancellation policy (there
could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says they have a 72 hour
cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cancellation with our
reservation.  

I think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from
the others, if at all. 

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  

Thanks, Kim.

"Article on SoCal ""Peaking"" Rate","New Peaking Rate for SoCalGas Could Spur Bypass 
After various fits and starts surrounding the issue over a number of months, California regulators Thursday established an alternative demand stand-by charge, called a ""peaking rate,"" for Southern California Gas Co., which could open up the utility to ""economic bypass"" by interstate pipeline projects lined up and ready to go at the border. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) rejected the utility's own proposal as ""anti-competitive."" 
""This case has been very contentious,"" said the lead commissioner assigned to the case, Richard Bilas. ""For the most part, the response to SoCal's application was negative."" Noting active opposition from large end-users, merchant generators and interstate pipelines, Bilas said that it is difficult to find an ideal peaking rate for gas. CPUC President Loretta Lynch dropped an alternate proposal to support Bilas. 
Ideally, the regulators are trying to keep the utility and its captive customers whole, while not deterring the option of what they call ""economic bypass,"" said Bilas, noting that SoCalGas' proposals did not ""reflect market reality. The new rate calculation is very complex, and potential competitors have yet to comment on its impact. 
A number of proposed interstate pipelines are lined up at the border awaiting a decision which would make it economic for them to proceed into SoCalGas territory, including an expansion of Mojave to Sacramento, Questar Corp.'s proposed Southern Trails oil-to-natural gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners area to Long Beach, and Kinder Morgan and Calpine's Sonoran pipe to San Francisco.
Up to this point the utility's residual load service (RLS) charges -- which customers of other pipelines had to pay in addition to charges paid to the transporting pipelines -- made it uneconomic to sign up on other lines. Called on by the CPUC to come in with a more moderate system, SoCalGas had proposed replacing the RLS charge with a peaking charge that customers said was just as onerous. 
The CPUC made its decision on a revised peaking charge unanimously on a 4-0 vote, with one of the five-member body's commissioners absent. 
The CPUC action establishes a peaking rate for SoCalGas customers who want to take only partial service from the utility and get their baseload service from another pipeline. Customers will be required to pay a monthly demand charge, public goods charge collected on a volumetric basis (so if there is no use, there is no charge), a reservation charge with a complex formula, and an interruptible peaking rate for volumes actually received. 
Peaking customers will be subject to daily balancing and a credit for service interruptions of firm capacity, which will apply to both new and existing facilities. 
""The new rate contrasts to the rate design in place for SoCalGas' standard full-requirements firm-load customers who pay for priority on a volumetric basis,"" Lynch said. ""We're changing the peaking rates so that customers not taking their full service from the utility will only pay for the amount of capacity they use on any given day. 
""The challenge for the CPUC in this case was to establish a peaking tariff for natural gas service that fairly compensates SoCalGas for standing ready to serve the peak needs only of some customers, while those customers go off its system for their baseload needs, but also to develop a tariff that allows SoCalGas to be able to compete with some of the energy company pipelines that plan to enter into SoCal's service territory. 
""We're trying to encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry picking or overbuilding for which core customers would end up paying for,"" Lynch added.

	1. Are the ROW records located in Salt Lake City or Long Beach, CA?
	
	2. Does Questar have a ROW data base? If so, can they prepare a report, which would identify product limitation (i.e. Crude Oil specific), multiple line rights, pipeline size limitations, assignability, consent, etc.

	3. An Encroachment report.

	4. A Rental/Term report.

	5. A report identifying any known curative problems.

	6. Can they identify whether the following problems that existed in 1997 have been cured?
		
		a. BLM issues RE: Contract Purchasers vs. Land Patents
		b. Pipeline lies outside of defined R/W in certain locations
		c. Railroad licenses sold to municipal entities that may have required new terms and rental amounts
		d. Relocations
			i. Anaheim Hills
			ii. Morongo Indian Tribe (possible Union Pacific Railroad R/W longitudinal occupation vs. private)
		e. Franchise Agreements

	7. Will new pipe be required for connection of Four Corners pipeline to existing Transwestern pipeline system? If so, would this be across the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation in Mohave County, AZ?

	It is my understanding that this due diligence will not involve the balance of Arizona, which includes the Navajos', Hopis' and the Bennett Freeze area (disputed tribal lands). Is this correct?

Michael,

In reference to our conversation of today, Perfomance Bond language will be forwarded for our review as a possible alternative in support of the subject project. Also it is our understanding that Kemper Insurance would be the proposed issuer of the bond.

My telephone number is 713-853-6409 and Fax number is 713-646-3368.

Thanks.

"RE: Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates","I think we ought to discuss the Order with Columbia Gulf.  Its possible we are ok.  The problem FERC seems to have is that under the negotiated contract it is impossible for anyone but Columbia and the Shipper to know what the rate is at the time of the transaction.  Columbia's deal contains a default rate (based on index differentials) applicable if the parties are unable to agree on a basis price used to determine the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"".   To avoid the application of the default rate, the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"" requires Columbia and the shipper to negotiate, and agree,  to a basis number on a daily basis.  The parties did not specify particular index's for the purpose of calculating basis.  Thus, under Columbia's deal only the default rate can be determined at the time of the transaction.  In contrast, Transwestern's deals appear to be similar to Columbia's default rate; i.e., a rate based upon index's where the index's are agreed upon and stated upfront.  Thanks.  Greg

Subject:	Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

Planes, fires, and floods along with my inability to use the stairs as a means of escape plus her desire to be ""back on the ground"" again add up to our moving into a one story patio styled home in a neighborhood just a couple of miles east of San Antonio !
Just joking about the location. . .It's off I-10 at Eldridge.

Closing on that property will be the first few days of December. Closing on The Spires is not known just yet. As far as actually moving out, we hope to be in the new place before December 23.  I would like to make a ""transfer of positions"" before Thanksgiving. 

It has been a joy working and playing with you and Ren these past several years. . .I will treasure those memories. . .you are indeed a very special lady.

Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated flow I was showing on the outage report was 130 mmcfd, (per Eric Faucheaux Planning) and the actual affect is 180 mmcfd.

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/01 to 12/01/01) Darrell is going to post something on it today.

I also had a WT2 outage on the report that the field was asking for. It showed a complete Station shut down for 24 hours. Darrell and I talked the field into moving it to next year. (Early March) If you have any questions let me know.

I talked to my Supervisor and here is what we can do, PNMGS will not accept or confirm any nominations under Off-System Transportation Contract T39817.  This will put the Contract in an ""INACTIVE"" status instead of total Termination of the Contract.
Prior to any  future expectation of Off-system Transportation, pursuant to Contract T39817 between PNMGS and TWPC, there will then be an updated and current determination on the Financial Responsibility as set forth under ARTICLE XII. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.   PNMGS will then decide what, if any, steps will need to be taken prior to such Off-system Transportation.

FERC Proposes New Rules On Energy Co Affiliate Dealings

09/26/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Commission proposed Wednesday new restrictions governing natural gas pipeline and electric utility affiliate dealings. 
The commission unanimously agreed to initiate a rulemaking to tighten regulations prohibiting pipelines and utilities from providing market-sensitive information to their marketing affiliates. 
FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline and utility companies to sell natural gas and electricity at market rates, providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passage of information giving a competitive advantage to their marketing affiliates. 
The proposed changes reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline industry in the 1980s. 
FERC's ""code-of-conduct"" rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't address the pipeline's power marketing affiliates. 
The commission's proposed rules would expand the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates, including those involved in financial transactions that don't entail the physical delivery of energy. 
The template for the proposed changes can be found in the conditions FERC imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). The commission approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger, contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates. 
FERC's rule changes would apply to other electric utilities with pipeline investments, such as CMS Energy (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and American Electric Power Co. (AEP). 
It wasn't immediately clear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements, such as the one between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and privately held Koch Industries. 
The largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants. 
For example, El Paso Corp. (EPG), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Enron Corp. (ENE), represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry, and are among the nation's top power marketers and merchant power plant developers. 
The changes under consideration stem from the commission's investigation of El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into California. 
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for California's dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's unprecedented high electricity cost last year.

FERC Grants PD for Tuscarora Lateral, Approves Northern Abandonment 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a favorable preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds to Tuscarora Gas Transmission's Wadsworth Lateral, a 14.2-mile pipeline extension and associated facilities that would increase Tuscarora's transportation capacity by 95,912 Dth/d. The lateral would extend from Tuscarora's mainline in northern Washoe County, NV, to an interconnect with Paiute Pipeline in Nevada. 
The expansion of the 229-mile pipeline system, which extends from Malin, OR, to a growing Nevada market, would serve two new power generation facilities in Nevada near Tracy and Wadsworth. Duke Energy plans to construct a 540 MW plant near Wadsworth, and Morgan Stanley is now constructing the 360 MW Naniwa Energy facility near Tracy. 
The added capacity also would supplement the growing gas distribution needs of Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Southwest Gas Corp., which collectively distribute natural gas to all of northern Nevada and portions of Northern California. 
If FERC approves the application, Tuscarora said it would begin construction in April 2002 and begin service by the end of that year. The $60 million expansion is supported by long-term, firm transportation contracts ranging from 10-to-15 years that are contingent upon completion. 
FERC also gave Northern Natural Gas the authority to abandon by sale its far east leg to Wisconsin Gas for use by affiliate Guardian Pipeline. The Northern line runs from Boone County, IA, to an interconnect with ANR in Rock County, WI. It extends to a delivery point near Eagle, WI. This nine mile, 24-inch diameter line is located primarily in Walworth and Waukesha, WI. 
FERC has given Guardian Pipeline authorization to eliminate construction of its Eagle lateral, which would have run parallel to the Northern line. The 8.5 mile, 16-inch diameter Eagle Lateral would have run from a connection with Guardian to Eagle, WI, at a delivery point with nonjurisdictional facilities of Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric. 

TRANSWESTERN TOUTS SUCCESS OF OPEN SEASON FOR SUN DEVIL PIPELINE

09/13/2001 
Foster Natural Gas Report 
Page 10 
(c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. 
Enron Corp.'s subsidiary Transwestern Pipeline Co. says it received requests for more than 1.3 Bcf/d of capacity for its proposed Sun Devil Pipeline expansion project that would transport San Juan Basin natural gas production to market areas in Phoenix and California by January 2004. 
Transwestern's Sun Devil Pipeline was announced as another of several new western states' gas transportation options. A Transwestern official said the gas-fired electric generation market in Arizona is the second largest growth market in the U.S. The company is working with shippers to finalize transportation agreements and expects to file its Sun Devil application with the FERC early next year. Shippers needing additional information can contact Project Director Kevin Hyatt at 713-853-5559 or email at Kevin.hyatt@enron.com. 
Transwestern announced its plans on August 8. The proposed project will include new compression and pipeline looping plus a new lateral, the Flagstaff - Phoenix, Arizona lateral, which would add approximately 175 miles to Transwestern's existing system. The project's estimated in-service date is January 2004. The proposed facility modifications will enable Transwestern to deliver an incremental 780,000 dth/d from the Blanco Hub located in San Juan County, New Mexico to the Thoreau area, an incremental 90,000 dth/d from Thoreau to the California border, and an incremental 450,000 dth/d from Thoreau to Phoenix. Potential supply receipt points from the San Juan Basin at the Blanco Hub are BRT/Val Verde Plant, WFS/Milagro Plant, WFS/Kutz Plant, and TransColorado/Blanco. Transwestern will consider interconnecting with other upstream and downstream pipelines, subject to the mutual agreement of the pipelines. The estimated maximum one-part reservation rates, exclusive of fuel and all surcharges, for firm service through the capacity described in this open season are as follows: San Juan to Thoreau -$.0985 dth/d; Thoreau to California -- $.240 dth/d; and Thoreau to Phoenix -- $0.454 dth/d. (See REPORT NO. 2348, pp6-7.) 
Transwestern's Red Rock Project (CP01-115), approved by FERC earlier this summer and under construction, will add 150 MMcf/d of new capacity for deliveries to the California border in mid-2002.

FERC Proposes Rulemaking, Plans Meetings 
In the same way your teacher loaded you down with books and assignments on the first day of the school year, new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood, presiding over his first meeting Wednesday. He put a whole slew of initiatives in motion, setting meetings, rulemakings, and calling for comments. 
Sorting it out: 
The Commission voted out a proposed rulemaking that which would extend the standards of conduct to fence off federally regulated transmission monopolies, both gas pipelines and electric transmission lines, from any other affiliate, including financial affiliates (see related story). For gas pipelines, which have been unbundled for a number of years and subject to affiliate codes of conduct for an equal number of years, the proposed rule will not be as onerous as it will for electric utilities, many of which are still bundled. This will mean, however, that gas transmission utilities must maintain firewalls between themselves and power affiliates, as well as gas marketing affiliates. Turn in your comments, please. 
By its second meeting in October, FERC will have a detailed business plan, including priorities and completion dates for its Oct. 1, 2001 to Oct. 1, 2002 fiscal year. Wood directed a panel of senior staff members and another of junior staff members and union representatives to come up with the plan. The commissioners voted Wednesday to amend their existing five-year plan to emphasize their major new emphasis on market monitoring and mitigation. 
FERC will be holding regional meetings on gas and electric infrastructure. It will start with a meeting on the western infrastructure following the Nov. 1-2 Western Governors Association meeting in Seattle. Wood said he expected federal and state regulators, and others to participate. A meeting for the Northeast may be scheduled in December, with sessions for the South and Midwest to come later. Attendance is not mandatory. 
FERC will cooperate with the Department of Energy in two technology-oriented sessions, one to explore technology solutions such as remote metering to capturing retail and wholesale consumer demand response in mid-February and another to investigate new transmission technology in mid-January. 
Don't be surprised to see a lot of topics debated at FERC's regular open meetings. The sunshine laws which prohibit more than two commissioners from discussing FERC business except in an open meeting, is confining, Wood said. (Usually commission staff runs back and forth among commissioners to establish positions before the meetings). Wood would like to have more discussions out in the open to work things out, and also to let the public know ""not just what we are doing, but why we are doing it."" 
And also, be prepared to pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America from now on at any FERC meeting presided over by Chairman Wood. The chairman also asked for a moment of silence Wednesday for the victims of the Sept. 11 attack.

Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners Wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers, including both natural gas pipelines and power lines, to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate. 
Previously, the rules simply required creation of a firewall, including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel, between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates. The proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate, gas or electric, including financial affiliates. 
The Commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates, which still in many cases have bundled operations. One option would enforce complete separation, while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load. Staff and Commissioners Wood, William Massey and Nora Brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel, so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non-affiliated competitors did not have access to. 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt, however, argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load. Breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities, she was concerned about the timing. ""I see no compelling reason at this time; there have been no complaints and no evidence."" She said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction. ""I agree with concept philosophically, but I think there will be other opportunities later on, after we do a little more bridge-building with state commissions."" 
Wood said he understood ""the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated."" Staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waivers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel. ""If I am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control room and get all the information I want,"" one staffer responded. 
Wood proposed, and the commissioners ratified, a proposed rule with no exceptions, but which makes clear that in the final rule the Commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required. Commenting parties should provide cost/benefit analysis on both sides of the question. State commissions are also invited to comment. Wood had suggested the Commission extend the separation to all sales employees, ""but make it clear that if we don't hear from people that they really want this separation, we ain't going to do it."" 

Govt keen to solve Enron crisis

Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. The Statesman Copyright (C) 2001 The Statesman Ltd. All Rights Res'd

STATESMAN NEWS SERVICE & AGENCIES NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept. 26. An inter-ministerial committee of Union secretaries is monitoring the Enron crisis regularly, to facilitate some kind of early solution to the Enron imbroglio involving the Dabhol power project, the power minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, said here today, while refusing to divulge the options being explored. 
An institutional framework committee, made up of the finance secretary Mr Ajit Kumar, power secretary Mr Ashok K Basu, law secretary Mr R L Meena and the petroleum secretary Mr V N Kaul, has been monitoring the developments on the project front, and regularly interacting with the parties Mr Prabhu said at a briefing.
We want an early solution to the problem, but the Centre has a very restricted role, limited only to facilitate an amicable solution, he said. 
Mr Prabhu refused comment on Enron chairman, Mr Kenneth Lays reported letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, seeking $5 billion in damages for terminating the contract, but said if by writing letters problems can be solved, we can also write letters. He said the government and the Cabinet have been kept informed of the status of the negotiations but it would be premature to speak at this stage on the problem which has its genesis in the contract signed in 1992. 
DPC AGM: Notwithstanding its depleting financial conditions, Dabhol Power Company has recorded a higher net profit of Rs 208 crore for the year ended 2000-01, compared with Rs 198 crore in the previous year. 
Disclosing this at the annual general meeting here today, the Enron India chief, Mr Wade Cline, said that the promoters of DPC would be making efforts to fetch additional finances from the institutions to complete the remaining 10 per cent construction work of the 2,184-MW power project at Guhaghar in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. 
Godbole report: The recommendations of the Godbole Committee, that held renegotiations with Enron on the future of DPC, are likely to remain on paper. 
This was clear from the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmukhs post-Cabinet-meeting statement today when he said the government noted certain recommendations of the Godbole panel following several round of talks with officials of Enron-DPC over the past five months. 
Mr Deshmukh said these recommendations would guide the government in future while negotiating fresh projects. 
The fate of DPC will thus remain undecided. In the last Cabinet meeting, the Maharashtra government announced terms of reference for an inquiry commission, which would be set up to probe the entire Enron-MSEB deal ab initio. However, the government is still to name a retired Supreme Court Judge to head the commission. 
Mr Madhav Godbole, a former bureaucrat, had clearly suggested that the panel should call off renegotiations, since Enron had announced its desire to walk out of the DPC. He said other states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan were ready to purchase Enron power, provided the rate per unit ranged between Rs 2.25 and Rs 2.40. This was rejected by Enron. 
Other recommendations noted by the State include: The Union Government which has given counter guarantee of Rs 2,500 crore, should raise bonds of the same amount and give them to Maharashtra as interest-free loan.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Wednesday on light demand, as traders hoped to take advantage of cash-outs on pipelines, marketers said. 
""Not much is getting done for next month,"" one veteran trader said. ""It's (Tuesday) all over again."" 
He said traders are hoping they can ""get away with as much as possible on those cash-outs and pray they don't get a call from pipelines"" asking them to ante up on the $2.15/MMBtu and above prices from earlier in the week. 
As for next-month bidding, ""everyone was asking,"" but not much was getting accomplished on baseload trading for October physical gas, a trader said. 
Wednesday, prices were at a premium to the New York Mercantile Exchange to start the session, but ended up either in convergence or slightly in contango, he said. 
Looking ahead, some incremental demand may be seen next month, as some utilities switch to natural gas from fuel oil and a number of nuclear energy sites go off-line for maintenance, one veteran trader said. 
October, a shoulder month, tends to be a major price discount month, he said. On the Nymex there's presently a 42-cent difference between the outgoing October contract and the November contract. The November-November 2002 spread is more than 80 cents. 
Wednesday, traders again saw tight ranges as the Nymex October contract traded under the spot cash bid-ask price, which are both at 30-month lows. 
Traders are in the midst of a three-day monthly bid week as they set baseload pricing for October. 
The Nymex Oct natural gas futures contract expired at $1.83 a million British thermal units, down 9.5 cents. November settled at $2.253/MMBtu, down 4.7 cents. 
The American Gas Association said 91 billion cubic feet of gas was added to storage, and the bearish report sparked a selldown in October to $1.76/MMBtu. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, the delivery point for Nymex gas, prices fell 5 cents-8 cents to a $1.85-$1.92/MMBtu closing range. 
First-of-month index for the Henry Hub is around $2.34/MMBtu. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $2.03-$2.15/MMBtu, up 5 cents-6 cents. 
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $1.72-$1.81/MMBtu, down 4 cents-5 cents. Index for September is at $2.66/MMBtu. 
At PG&E Citygate, traders paid $1.85-$2.05/MMBtu, down 3 cents on the bid, up 8 cents on the ask. September first-of-month index is at $2.71/MMBtu. 
At the Katy hub in East Texas, prices were in a $1.81-$1.87/MMBtu range, down 6 cents. First-of-month September index is $2.37/MMBtu. 
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.65-$1.78/MMBtu, down 3 cents-9 cents. Index is at $2.32/MMBtu, traders said.

Enron unit Transwestern Pipeline has received requests for more than 1.3 bcfd of capacity on its proposed 400-mile Sun Devil Pipeline expansion project, which would bring natural gas from New Mexico's San Juan basin to market in Phoenix, then to California by January 2004. ""Sun Devil is an important project that will serve the gas-fired electric generation market in Arizona, which is the second-largest growth market in the US,"" Transwestern said. The company presently is working with shippers to finalize transportation agreements. It plans to apply with FERC early next year. The company also said its Red Rock pipeline project will make 150 MMcfd of gas capacity available for delivery into California in mid-2002.

Passing Gas: How dancing elephants and smart pigs help heat your home

REVEALED Finding natural gas was once a matter of luck -- surface seeps provided the only real clue. Eventually, though, people realized that seeps often occurred on anticlinal or dome-like slopes, indicating the presence of an underground trap. In the early 1900s, oil companies began relying on geologists to help them read what the rocks had to say, but it was many years before seismic technology could give a picture of rock formations hidden deep in the Earth. These days, specialized vibroseis trucks use mechanical vibrations to create seismic waves. Costing US$350,000 each, the trucks weigh from 18,000 to 30,000 kg and travel in groups of four or five. They are often called ""dancing elephants,"" operating in unison at 100-metre intervals. An on-board hydraulic system presses a central plate against the ground, lifting the truck into the air and vibrating it over a controlled frequency band. The resulting waves are reflected from rock layers in the Earth -- different types of rock reflect waves differently, much as a ball bounced on pavement will bounce higher than a ball bounced on sand. The returning waves are then measured by sensitive geophones, or jugs, strung out every 25 metres along the ground. Supercomputers process the data to generate a 2-D or 3-D picture of the underground structures. In the end, the only sure way to know if gas exists is to drill, but these days the final decision is based on much more than a hunch and a prayer, since so much is at stake: about $900,000, the average cost to complete a gas well in western Canada. 
SNIFFED Natural gas at the wellhead contains a potentially poisonous contaminant called hydrogen sulphide, or H2S. Natural gas that contains more than 1% of it is called ""sour"" gas. It has a strong odour, similar to rotten eggs. About 30% of Canada's total natural gas production is sour, most of it found in Alberta and B.C. By contrast, discoveries in the Arctic and off the East Coast contain less than 1% H2S and are called ""sweet."" If the gas is sour, it is ""sweetened"" by converting up to 99% of the H2S into elemental sulphur for use in fertilizers and for export. The remaining H2S is flared, a controversial incineration process that results in the conversion of H2S to sulphur dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere. (An excellent account of the controversy can by found in Andrew Nikiforuk's book Saboteurs: Wiebo Ludwig's War Against Big Oil, to be published this month.) Whether sweet or sour, the natural gas used to heat our homes must be processed before it is pipeline-ready for shipment. Processing occurs at plants close to the production areas or at straddle extraction plants on major pipeline routes. In Canada, there are 837 processing plants, 756 of them in Alberta. The four largest processors are: Husky Energy Inc. (51 plants), Anderson Exploration Ltd. (49), Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (47) and Conoco Canada Ltd. (35). 
SQUEALED ""Smart pigs"" aren't actually pigs. They're sophisticated tools that travel inside pipelines checking for corrosion and evidence of stress or cracking in the pipe. Early versions were called pigs because they squealed as they moved inside the pipe. Propelled by the gas, they travel at speeds from 0.8 to 16 km per hour. Only about six companies in the world build and inspect pipelines with pigs, which have cost up to US$1 million for researchand development. Pigs range in size from 89 mm to 1.4 m in diameter and can be as long as 6 metres. Special pig ""launch and trap facilities"" are built along the length of the pipeline to allow for insertion and removal at various intervals. 
TRAPPED In nature, natural gas, made predominantly of methane -- four hydrogen atoms attached to one carbon atom -- is found mixed with other hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane and butane, as well as hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. Most experts believe the carbon and hydrogen came from microscopic plants and animals deposited with mud and silt at the bottom of ancient oceans. Over millions of years, the intense pressure and heat caused by growing layers of sediment transformed this organic material into crude oil and natural gas. The sediment itself eventually became porous sedimentary rock. Oil and gas migrate upwards through this rock because they are less dense than the seawater in its pores. You would see the same result if you put a mixture of gas, oil and water in a glass: they would separate according to their different densities. If the gas manages to reach the surface, it is released into the atmosphere. But often it will be stopped in its upward journey by impermeable rock formations, or cap rocks, that trap it in underground reservoirs. 
SHIPPED Hidden a metre or more underground, a vast subterranean network of steel pipes and plastic tubes delivers natural gas from the wellhead to the consumer. Almost 80,000 km of gas pipelines link producers in the west to the populated regions of eastern Canada and the U.S. Efficient movement through the pipeline requires transmission at high pressure along the way. Propelled at speeds of up to 40 km per hour, it takes about three days for natural gas from Alberta to reach markets in southwestern Ontario. A voracious U.S. appetite for natural gas has sparked recent additions to the system, such as the $1.8-billion, 1,051-km Maritimes and Northeast pipeline that moves Sable Island gas from Nova Scotia to Dracut, Mass., and the $4.5-billion, 2,988-km Alliance pipeline that links B.C. and Alberta to the Chicago market. 
MEASURED In the metric system, joules measure energy content. The joule was named after James Joule, an English physicist who co-discovered the law of conservation of energy: ""Energy used up in one form reappears in another and is never lost."" One joule is the amount of energy required to heat one gram of water by 1/4 degree Celsius. Since joules are so small, people normally speak in terms of gigajoules, or one billion joules. An average Canadian home would use about 150 GJ in a year, and one gigajoule on a particularly cold winter day. Producers and pipeline operators measure natural gas by volume using cubic metres (or cubic feet, just to confuse the issue). One cubic metre is the size of an average dishwasher. Canada is the third-largest producer of natural gas in the world, producing 162 billion cubic metres in 1999. No. 1 is the Russian Federation (551 billion), No. 2 is the U.S. (540 billion) and No. 4 is the U.K. (100 billion). According to Oilweek magazine, the top three Canadian producers in 2000 were: Alberta Energy Company Ltd. (gas revenues of $2.3 billion), PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. ($1.6 billion) and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. ($1.3 billion). 
DISCOVERED The first natural gas discovery in Canada was at Stoney Creek, N.B., in 1859. The first commercial development came 30 years later, when entrepreneur Eugene Coste drilled a well that supplied communities in Essex County, Ont., near Windsor. By 1904, he had moved west, making history in 1909 with ""Old Glory,"" so-called for the size of its flare, near Bow Island, Alta. This discovery was large enough to justify a 270-km-long, 40-cm-wide pipeline to Calgary, the longest of its kind at the time. 
PRICED If Canada has so much natural gas, why did prices hit an all-time high of $16.90 per gigajoule in December 2000, up from $2.63 in January 2000? Simple supply and demand, combined with a cold winter and fears of low storage levels. Since then, prices have fallen to the $4.50 range, partly due to the economic slowdown. Matthew Foss, an economist with the Canadian Energy Research Institute in Calgary, predicts an average price of $3.50 per gigajoule this winter, since storage facilities are at near capacity and new drilling is proceeding: about 13,000 gas wells by year's end.

Heating Bills This Winter to Ease Sharply Utilities: Lower natural gas prices are reducing costs for Californians, but reliance on imports could be a problem in the long run, studies say.

Winter heating bills in California will be substantially smaller than the swollen tabs of last year because of sharply lower natural gas prices and plentiful supplies, utilities said Wednesday. 
But the longer-term picture for consumers is not as rosy, despite the recent decline in wholesale natural gas prices. 
Two reports released this week warn that California's heavy reliance on imported natural gas, which fuels most of the state's power plants in addition to fulfilling most of its heating needs, could be setting the state up for future energy crises. 
For now, the wholesale price of natural gas is dropping along with most fossil fuels, and supplies are plentiful. Natural gas futures slumped to a 2 1/2-year low Wednesday after an industry report showed a bigger-than-expected jump in U.S. inventories. 
The American Gas Assn. said supplies in storage rose 3.3% last week to 2.848 trillion cubic feet, continuing a steady build made possible by reduced demand from manufacturers. 
In response, natural gas for October delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 4.9%, to $1.83 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have dropped 82% from a Dec. 27 record of $10.10 per million BTU, caused by scant supplies. 
Prices in California, which imports 85% of its natural gas from other U.S. states and Canada, peaked much higher in December at about $60 per million BTU. California wholesale prices now are hovering close to the Nymex price. 
California was clobbered harder last winter than the rest of the country for several reasons: colder-than-usual weather, heavy use by in-state power plants and reduced pipeline capacity caused by a deadly explosion. In addition, state regulators accused a major pipeline operator, the El Paso Natural Gas unit of El Paso Corp., of manipulating the market; federal regulators have not yet ruled on that case. 
""The message this year is much better than it was at this time last year,"" said Anne Smith, vice president for customer service at Southern California Gas, a subsidiary of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Southern California Gas' more than 5 million customers paid record prices last year, as did the customers of Sempra's San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric. 
Unlike with electricity, the price of natural gas is not fixed for residential and small-business customers. The gas utilities pass along the commodity price to customers with no markup. 
Last winter, which runs from November to March in the utility world, the average residential customer of Southern California Gas got a monthly bill of $80. This winter, the average bill is expected to be about $60, Smith said. 
The basic commodity cost for natural gas sold to its residential customers for this October, for example, will be 15.9 cents per therm, compared with 57.04 cents last October. (A therm is one-tenth the standard wholesale measure of 1 million BTUs, or about 100 cubic feet of gas.) 
Transmission costs, which remain fairly constant year to year, average about 40 cents per therm for the company's residential customers. (The average single-family home uses about 75 therms a month.) 
PG&E projects similar cost declines, and both utilities say they have plenty of gas in storage to meet the needs of their core residential and small-business customers. 
But problems loom with California's natural gas supply system, according to studies released this week by the California Energy Commission and the California Public Interest Research Group. 
The two studies agree that heavy demand has strained the state's delivery and storage systems, but otherwise they had little in common. 
The final draft of the Energy Commission staff report, released Monday, noted that utilities already are moving to expand or build new pipelines, and recommended that the state encourage the drilling of more natural gas wells and expansion of pipeline systems within California, among other things. 
The CalPIRG report, released Wednesday, advocates that the state deny licenses to any new power plants fueled by natural gas and to encourage renewable energy production through favorable taxation and by requiring that a minimum of 20% of the state's electricity come from wind, solar and geothermal sources by 2010. 
""Natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels,"" said CalPIRG's Brad Heavner, the report's author. ""But it's not a magic bullet, and by relying on it we are setting ourselves up.""


USA: FERC OKs Tuscarora natgas pipeline for Nev, Calif.

09/26/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. won preliminary approval on Wednesday from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build a pipeline to ship natural gas to local distribution companies and electric power plants in Nevada and California. 
The pipeline and related facilities would carry up to about 96 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
The agency must still determine the environmental impact of the pipeline before making a final decision on the project. 
Tuscarora owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that begins at a connection with PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest Corp., located near Malin, Ore., and extending southeasterly for 229 miles to its terminus in Storey County, Nevada, at the Tracy Power Plant. The power plant is owned by Sierra Pacific Power Co., an affiliate of Tuscarora. 
Shipments in the pipeline would be phased in over a two-year period beginning in November, 2002. 
Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. is a partnership between Sierra Pacific Resources and TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.

"WT-2 capacity","


Planning has conducted flow studies to determine the capacity of WT-2 system with respect to receiving volume from NNG at Halley interconnect. The limiting factors in determining the capacity of this system were the maximum discharge pressure at WT-2 and the average pressure requirements at Valero-Ward pipeline.

WT-2 is able to discharge at a maximum of 1040 psig pressure and the operating pressure range of Valero pipeline in this area is 975-995 psig.
Based on the above conditions WT-2 would be able to deliver only 505 mmcf/d gas to :

Lone-Star Warwink	  30 mmcf/d
Valero Ward		115 mmcf/d
Ovasis			138 mmcf/d
Westar-Ward		 80  mmcf/d 
Valero Pecos		 95  mmcf/d
Lonestar Pecos		 47  mmcf/d
Total			505 mmcf/d

This flow model indicates that ( assuming main line valve-208 B is closed) WT-2 would be able to receive up to 100 mmcf/d from NNG at Halley interconnect.
The remaining gas supply behind Wt-2 would flow from NGPL-Winkler, EOG, Keystone/ Sid Richardson, Monument and WT-1.

Based on the data obtained from our TW-Firm Data Book the existing committed volume at WT-2 for next five months are:

		Aug-01 Sep-01	Oct-01 Nov-01	Dec-01	  
Comitted volume		582  	582	582 	565	545
( mmcf/d)											

505 mmcf/d capacity:							
*** Less USGT at		77	77	77	60	40
     WT-2  	       

***. Option-1: 12 mmcf/d could be handle at WT-1 on Aug-01, 21 mmcf/d on Sep-01, 7 mmcf/d 
                       on Oct-01 and the rest through Texas Panhandle Lateral. Capacity is sold at WT-1 
                       on Nov-01 and Dec-01.
    . Option-2: Or all through Texas Panhandle Lateral.
                                                            
From Jan-02 to Jul-02, capacity is not available at WT-2. Sold at 505 mmcf/d maximum capacity.

Capacity availability at WT-1  from Aug-01 to Jul-02 based on 425 mmcf/d :
	
		Aug-01	Sep-01	Oct-01	Nov-01	Dec-01
Available capacity:		12	21	7	-11	-11	
		Jan-02	Feb-02	Mar-02	Apr-02	May-02
Available capacity:		11	11	26	55	54		
				Jun-01	Jul-01
Available capacity:		67	62

Note: All volumes are in mmcf/d. 

If you have any questions please let's discuss.

"Technical Market View","Per our conversation yesterday on TW fuel sales, below are the general criteria I use in formulating my market view.  Please note that these are listed in order of importance.

1. Continuation Charts:
	Looks like the recent move to 2.450 completed the -B- Wave down and we are currently in the -C- wave up of this larger -A- up; -B- down; and  -C- up move.  	Specifically, within this -C- wave up:
	2.450 to 2.854 = A up of -C-
	2.854 to 2.630 = B dn of -C-
	2.630 to ????  = C up of -C-; where 2.880 is minimum expected upside target, 2.960 is the pivot, and 3.035 is maximum expected upside target.

2.  Spot - 12 Month Strip Spread:
	This study has thus far accurately called for a feeble rally this winter, with the downtrend continuing into January 2002.

3.  Seasonal Price Patterns:
	Calendar January is the highest probability window for the low of the year, then spot tends to rally into late October, with two minor cycles:
	Summer pre-season rally: Typically bottoms in late January, and peaks from mid-April to mid-May.
	Winter pre-season rally: Typically bottoms in late September, and peaks in late October to late November.


Conclusion:
	Criteria #2 and #3 point to prices continuing to slide downward into the first part of 2002.  
	Criteria #1 infers significant resistance if prices rally into the 2.880 to 3.305 range.  
	Short to intermediate term trend-followers will be looking to buy strength if we get a close > 2.960.  
	On the downside, for each day prices don't close > 2.960, the bearish case for a continued decline to the 2.120 to 1.950 area will remain intact. 
	 Implied volatility is 84%, which is somewhat on the higher part of the volatility scale for natural gas and infers current prices wont stay where they currently are for 	long.

"FW: Southern Trails Cancels Calif Part of Pipeline Conversion","I know we sent in an expression of interest a few weeks ago.  I assume that is on the portion of the pipe upstream of the California border??  Do we know what their conversion costs are?  I had heard that the conversion costs were very high and actually made the capacity costs out of the market.  Is that true?  Is Questar truly going forward with the conversion and will they have it ready for service  by June 1st next year??  Why would Questar spend the money if they aren't sure there will be any take away capacity at the border?

Hope all is well Kim!

Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"Add This to your Price Discovery Sites","Williams Launches uE Web Site For Cross Commodity Pricing 
Tulsa-based Williams on Monday launched uE, a cross-commodity price index for both spot and future energy prices, as a companion to its web-based EnergyNewsLive.com. Similar to the Dow Jones for equity markets, the Williams uE will offer an equivalent benchmark for the overall price of energy, measuring the price average of eight individual commodities: electricity, natural gas, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, ethane, propane, residual fuel and jet fuel. 
The site includes information on pricing trends including a national spot uE, forward uE, regional uE, commodity quotes, as well as daily, weekly and monthly commentary. Included on the site is EnergyPulse, which will feature Dr. Dennis O'Brien, director of energy and policy at the University of Oklahoma. EnergyPulse now airs every Friday on Williams' EnergyNewsLive site, and offers an analysis of trends in energy pricing and the impact the economy has on energy. 
Williams uE was introduced a year ago when EnergyNewsLive debuted, and Williams said it has tested and refined the site for the company's own market activity. It also has been reviewed by the Energy Information Administration, said Williams. To view the site, visit www.williams-ue.com.

Option 1 -Palermo to Naples (11 hrs) vs. Option 2 - Palermo to Livorno (18
hrs):

Option 1 - Afternoon in Sicily, early dinner, 2000 departure from Palermo,
0700 arrival in Naples, followed by a 6-hour drive to Lucca (arrive around
1300, assuming no stops).

Option 2 - Afternoon and evening in Sicily, normal dinner, 2300 departure
from Palermo, 1700 arrival in Livorno, followed by a 1-hour drive to Lucca.

Remember that these ferries have shopping and dining and other stuff.  If
the cost difference isn't much (Dee told me she's getting an exact cost from
the ferry companies), I vote for the longer ferry ride arriving closer to
our final destination.

J, D, P and J,

Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry
info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to
Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that
will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2
hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742
for each car).

FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but
none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few
of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on
the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for
Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.

Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.
She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told
her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She
is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on
a part time basis.

Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which
is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the
cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome
and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return
home.

I will keep you posted as we hear more.

Thanks, Kim.

I have 2 Alamo full size 4 dr/5 passenger  cars reserved for you. We do
not
have to prepay. The all-inclusive
rate is 1,617250. ITL (approx 742.00) for the 12 days. This includes
collision and theft insurance, taxes and
unlimited mileage. I think that this is very good. 1 car booked under
John
Watson and 1 under Dennis Dye.
They are manuals.

The ferry from Palermo to Naples is daily, departing at 800pm, arriving
700am. It looks as though the vehicles will cost between 111,600 and
134,600
each. The passengers in a double outside cabin are 96,500 to 111,500. )
I
believe, per passenger.

The ferry from Palermo to Livorno departs at 1100pm and arrives the next
day
about 5pm. The double outside suite is
240,000. The coach seat is 120,000. Each car is 175,000 to 205,000. I
need
to verify if the cabin rate includes the
passenger fee.

I had found a ferry to Salerno, but it only operates 1 day a week, not
the
day you need.
I'll get back to you.

I'm sorry to say that we won't be able to have our holiday party as planned
on the 16th of December.  I apologize for having asked you to save the
date, but I guess, on the bright side, you can look forward to at least one
peaceful night in the midst of the many, many parties that will take place
this holiday season.

I know that we'll re-visit our giving party in the future, but we'll miss
having the opportunity to celebrate with you this year.  Have a wonderful
holiday season!

Ann

ps.  We still plan on helping a family in need this Christmas.  If you'd
like to join us in giving, let me know via email.  I'll have a list of
things needed by the family on Friday, Nov 30th.  Thanks.

Gina -regarding TW's Gallup Project:  
 In-service dates were: Bloomfield -4/6/2000; LaPlata ""A"" -4/20/2000; and Gallup -5/1/2000 (Sempra protest delayed the issuance of certificate until 1/13/2000).  
10,000 HP was added at the Gallup Compressor Station; coolers and not compression were constructed at Bloomfield and LaPlata which reduced the temperature of the gas flowing in the San Juan Lateral.  This reduction in temperature caused the lateral and associated down field compressors to operate more efficiently creating an incremental 50,000 Mcf per day of firm capacity on the  Blanco to Thoreau segment of the San Juan Lateral.  The project enabled Transwestern to maintain its mainline operating pressure from Thoreau west to California at 950 psig at all times thereby accommodating shifts in market demand to the east without restricting delivery capacity to California.  As a result, TW is able to once again operate its mainline west of Thoreau at its certificated capacity of 1,090,000.
Total final costs filed with FERC were $13 million.  As stated in the original application, the project was funded with internally generated funds.
Please talk to Drew regarding the rates.
The shipper data is correct.   All the contract terms are for five years with the exception of El Paso Energy at 5 1/2 years and North Star Steel which expires on March 31, 2008.
As the Commission observed in the January 13 Order, ECS is not a jurisdictional company; whereas the motor that they would own is a jurisdictional facility.  Transwestern was therefore instructed to restructure its relationship with ECS so that Transwestern would have sufficient control over the motor to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation.  Transwestern and ECS signed an Operational Control Agreement obligating Transwestern to assume operational control over the motor with respect to all facilities and activities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.  DREW -ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

Subject:	pipeline project questions



Sarah,

As we discussed, Inside FERC has lost track of current information on a couple
of Enron projects for our online Pipeline Tracker service. As you can see below,
the questions are quite basic.

One, Northern Natural East Leg 2000 was scheduled to go into service in Nov.
'99, but at some point had a delay. I'd like to know if and when it went into
service; if it was built under blanket authority or was it certificated*; if it
indeed runs 264 miles from Iowa to Illinois and if so, what is the diameter; how
much did it cost, $300 million?; if it has a postage stamp rate, and if so, what
is it?; who are the shippers?; and with whom does it compete?

* If that's the case, please provide the docket number.

For the other, Transwestern Gallup, I'd like to know if it went into service
Feb. 1, 2000, as planned; how much compression was added at the Bloomfield and
LaPlata ""A"" stations (or anywhere else for this project); if it added 140,000
Mcf/day, bringing the mainline to 1.09 Bcf/day; if it cost $11.6 million as
projected and if internal funds were used; and what are the rates, which FERC
ordered the company to disclose. We had the shippers listed as follows: Duke
Energy Trading and Marketing LLC, 40,000 Mcf/day; El Paso Energy Marketing Co.,
40,000 Mcf/day; Southern Energy Inc., 25,000 Mcf/day; Sempra Energy Trading
21,500 Mcf/day; Reliant Energy Services Inc., 10,000 Mcf/day and North Star
Steel Co., 3,500 Mcf/day. Is that data still correct and what is the duration of
the deals? Five years? Also, in approving the project, FERC ordered Transwester
to restructure its relationship with Enron Compression Services Co., which was
to be the owner of the project; how was that structured?

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

"Re: How to Make a Roux reference, and a recipe","Thanks, Lester!  We'll give it a try...

We liked your original recipe so much, we gave it a try the very next
weekend at our own house.  I, too, made a substitution, using smoked oysters
instead of the fresh oysters for which the recipe called.  They were
probably easier to dice than the raw ones and added another layer of flavor
to the soup.  Definitely a keeper!

Subject: How to Make a Roux reference, and a recipe


Dear Gourmet Group,

At our last meal, my assignment was to bring an oyster & artichoke
soup, based on a very rich recipe from Commanders Palace in New
Orleans.  Under ridiculous time pressure, I did manage to find a
site on the web that explained what a ""blond"" roux was. Alas, my
soup could have used some more time simmering and reducing, and
I was left wondering what a second attempt would taste like.

Well, as it happened two weeks later I needed to bring something
to a pot luck dinner, and those three sticks of butter left from
the first soup had been taunting me ever since, daring me to clog
my own arteries. So I thought maybe I could use the butter by making
another soup to take.  Well, the first soup was oysters & artichokes,
but I happen to have a soft spot for corn chowder, so I converted
the original recipe into a very successful corn chowder.  (It was
a big hit at the pot luck party.)

Here is the URL of the ""How to Make a Roux"" tutorial on the web:

http://www.learn2.com/05/0574/05748.asp

And I have attached my recipe for Rich Corn Chowder.

Best regards,

Lester

"TW Index Deals","It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several ""packages"" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).  If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it.  Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it?

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

"email to USG confirming our decision not to require more LOC $","
Rob Cooper (of US Gypsum) asked me to send him an email concerning our decision to not to force USG to provide the remaining 8 months of LOC and also asked me to verify a couple of other points.  Below is my reply.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Paul, please provide the dollar amount needed in the blank below.
______________________________________________________________--

Rob,

After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims, we will not proceed in seeking the additional $___________ letter of credit (worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges).  The current letter of credit valued at $__________ is sufficient.

Also, our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1, 2002.  In our latest discussions with SOCAL, they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time.  It would probably be best for you to discuss this with them yourself to verify its availability completely and thoroughly.

Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Best regards,

Mark

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.  
 
Bill

LNG Tanker Prevented from Entering Boston Harbor
 
Claiming that Coast Guard plans are too vague, the mayor of Boston 
has filed suit in a federal court to prevent a tanker full of 
millions of gallons of LNG from entering the city's the harbor. After 
the terrorist attacks on September 11th, the Coast Guard kept tankers 
from entering the port for over a month while formulating a safety 
plan with officials from federal to local levels. After a disaster 
plan was prepared, the Coast Guard re-opened the harbor to tankers 
carrying the highly flammable gas on October 16th. Boston's mayor 
contends that the plans are not specific enough and provide too 
little information on evacuation and protection procedures for nearby 
neighborhoods. He pointed out that the ships path would run close to 
a recreation area and a highly traveled bridge. However, his 
allegations were contradicted by Massachusetts acting governor who 
said that the Coast Guards plans were sufficient to ensure safety. 
The governor said that the Coast Guard had worked closely with the 
appropriate public safety officials to create a security plan to 
ensure the safe delivery of LNG and she was confident that the plans 
were adequate. During the peak winter season, LNG provides up to 35% 
of heating supplies in New England.
 
From  <http://www.enerfax.com/> http://www.enerfax.com:
Arctic Pipeline Plans May be Delayed
Plummeting natural gas prices and bulging inventories may have zapped
the urgency once attached to the construction of pipelines from Alaska's
North Slope or Canada's Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories. It
is believed that sustained natural gas prices of $3 per MMBtu is needed
to make the ventures viable. Supporters of the projects contend that
even though current prices are not sufficient to garner the necessary
investments, it will be 6-10 years before either pipeline is
operational, as it could take up to 4 years to obtain regulatory
approval. They point to declining production from wells in the US and
maturing Canadian resources as proof of the need to proceed with the
projects. Even though the consortium of companies planning to build the
$2 billion Mackenzie Delta pipeline settled with native tribes by giving
them 33% ownership, they have not proceeded with plans to build the
1,375 mile pipeline. The consortium, which consists of Imperial Oil,
Conoco, Shell Canada and Exxon Mobil, says a feasibility study is
necessary to make an informed decision. Companies backing the $15 - $17
billion Alaskan pipeline, which could follow the route of either the
Alaskan Highway or go under the Beaufort Sea to the Mackenzie Delta, say
they will need federal assistance for the project to be feasible.
Alaska's governor, a strong supporter, has already asked the Senate to
supply incentives. BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips are the major companies
involved in the Alaskan plans.

"RE: FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points","Gary you are correct in your assesment that we can avoid electrical power demand charges if we shut down during power utilities pear power period.  However, in discussions prior to finalizing this contract, I got the impression that a decision had been made that we MUST shut the unit down during peak demand periods or the econimics of the project did not come out.  (these discussions included: Mike Nelson, Rich Jolly, Mary Kay Miller, Dave Fotti, Ben Asante, D. Schoolcraft, James Centelli, Kevin Hyatt etc....)

Second:  The issue came up of ""What about during tariff months?"", can we still shut down during peak demand periods.  Again, if I remember correctly, the answer was, Yes, even during tariff months we don't have a choice we would have to shut down.  

Third:  I was under the impression that from a risk standpoint we would not have to deal with more than ONE peak demand period in the month.

Fourth:  ECS was responsible for working with the CDEC to establish an automated system which would read CDEC's online load profile and convert the reading into a signal which would automatically control the loading on the Compressor and Motor (which would provide us with the opportunity to avoid the CDEC's peak load periods).  TW of course would have an override option.  However, I was also under the impression that ECS would hold TW harmless & reimburse, if this feature was not provided.  

I may be interpreting this incorrectly but again the CSA specifies ECS's obligation in helping us avoid the demand energy charge.  The demand charge is $12.21 * 10,000 KW  * 12 Months = $1.465,200 of potential rebate back to TW each year.

Subject:	RE: FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points

As I understand/interpret the Gallup contract, we can completely avoid electrical power demand charges (approximately $42,000 per month) if we do not run the unit during the power utilities peak power period.  If we can not shut down the unit, we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period.

Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day (5-7 PM), Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day.  Through access to Tri-States history data, I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be.  I can look at the current day's usage and estimate if today's peak will be higher than the higher of (1) my estimated peak or (2) the actual peak so far this month.  If so, the ""Probability today is a peak"" will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today.   The ""Probability now is peak"" approached 100 when an actual peak is underway.  The Tri-State Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway.

Note that it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak.  If the first day of the month has an estimated peak 1000 and last years peak for the same month, was 985.  It appears possible that this will be a power peak day.  Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was 1010.  Now on the second day of the month, the estimated peak is 965, not likely to be a power peak day.  The third day has an estimated peak of 1005, a possible power peak day.  If the actual for the third day is 1012, it now becomes the new peak for the month.  If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below 1012, they are not likely to be power peaks, and unit turndown is not required.

The point is, to completely avoid demand charges, we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month, and also on the third day.  The utility integrates their peak over a 30 minute period, thus the minimum time the unit could be down.  I'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month.

So far this month, I guessed a power peak on 10/1/01 starting at 20:18 and ending at 21:05.  The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was 10/1/01 starting at 20:30 lasting to 21:00.


I'm sorry for any confusion.  I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators.  If there are any additional questions, do not hesitate to call me at 87-7546.

Subject:	Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report

UPDATE--Yesterday it was suggested that if Legal were to concur we would post capacity for a rolling 31 day period such that we would effectively be posting capacity which could be sold for one day up to 29 or 30 days so long as it was less than one full month.
Legal has agreed we can interpret the Order to allow this type of posting and Marketing has agreed with the idea as well.  Hence the IT people have reworked the Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report to reflect a rolling 31 day period.  Toby will be sending out the link to review the example today.  The filing at FERC and the initial report will still indicate that no daily capacity is currently available.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at X7419.  Thanks.  gh

"FW: Kinder Morgan - Sonoran Project","All,

Today, I learned that Kinder Morgan has approached FERC with a proposal to submit separate applications on phase one (NM, AZ) and phase two (CA) of the Sonoran Pipeline.  Reportedly, FERC rejected the approach, advising KM to come back when they could make an application on the full project.  This probably delays their filing timetable because the California leg will be significantly more difficult to market, environmental stakeholders are likely to be more adversarial, and the probability of activist NIMBY landowners is high.

Does anybody know when KM plans to file their application?  Is Phase one in-service of summer 2003 feasible if an application for the full pipeline is required?  How long would it take KM to prepare the phase two application for the Sonoran project?

Please keep this info confidential.  Also, it would be helpful if you could corroborate through your sources.

Subject:	Kinder Morgan - Sonoran Project

Danny,

Today, Kevin and I met with Scott Parker (KMI), Ron Brown (KMI), and Chad Driscoll (Calpine) to discuss possibilities of bundling Kinder Morgan's Sonoran project with Sun Devil.  A summary of our discussions is outlined below.

Concept

Explore the possibility of combining the Sun Devil and Sonoran Pipeline projects into a single venture along the existing Transwestern route from San Juan to the California Border.  Progress separate projects for service to Phoenix (Sun Devil) and California (Sonoran).

Rationale

Lower costs, higher margins
Greater capacity, economic scale, expansion options
Reduced stakeholder interventions (Navajos, environmental interests groups, shippers)
Reduced regulatory process

Background

On May 2, 2001, Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans to jointly develop the Sonoran Pipeline, subject to customary approvals and sufficient interest by potential shippers.  As proposed, the Sonoran pipeline will be a 1,160 mile high pressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in California.  The project, with an estimated cost of $1.8 billion, will provide natural gas transportation capacity to California to serve growing electric generation demand.  

The proposed pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases.  The first phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with the second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area.  

The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer of 2003.  Phase one will consist of a 460 mile, 36 inch diameter pipeline from the interconnection of TransColorado Gas Transmission and Transwestern Pipeline to various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan, NM.  In addition, the pipeline will continue westward with deliveries into the California/Arizona border.  A 20 mile, 24 inch diameter lateral would be built to Topock, AZ.  The initial capacity would start with 750,000 dth/d, with capability to expand to 1 million dth/day.  The estimated cost of phase one is $624 with a targeted in-service date of summer 2003.  Sponsors said the open season will seek at a minimum, 20-year term commitments at a fixed transport rate of $0.39/dth for firm transportation.  Sonoran proposes to charge shippers actual fuel on phase one via a fuel tracker.  Fuel is estimated at 1.3%.  More than 1 billion cubic feet per day of binding agreements and non-binding expressions of interest were received for the first phase of the project.  

Phase two will be a 590 mile, 42 inch diameter pipeline from Needles on the California border to points within California, terminating near Antioch in Contra Costa County.  Once completed, the pipeline will be able to transport between 1 million and 1.5 million dth/day.  The in-service date for the phase two has yet to be determined.  The cost is projected to be $1.1 billion.   Another 1.5 Bcf/d of non-binding commitments and expressions of interest were received for phase two.  

Sonoran has already received binding bids from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 dth/d for phase one and another 500,000 dth/d for its phase two. Once completed, the new pipeline could connect with Kern River, Mojave, Elk Hills, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Gas and various gas-fired power plants.  

SoCalGas's Residual Load Service (RLS) penalty woull not affect the Sonoran project because the pipeline route parallels PG&E's pipelines and the primary target load is new gas-fired generation not within SoCalGas's market territory. 

The pipeline also will connect to a new underground storage facility near Lodi being developed by Lodi Gas Storage, Inc., a subsidiary of Houston based Western Hub Properties LLC.  

The project could have a noteworthy co-owner: the Navajo Nation, the sovereign government of 180,000 residents on the largest Indian reservation within the United States.  An agreement in principle to give the Navajos an ownership interest in the $1.7 billion pipeline that crosses their reservation was disclosed in August by an executive of Kinder Morgan at Indian Energy 2001, a conference of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes that highlighted the growing role Indian tribes play in powering the West.  As part of the deal to secure that right of way, the Navajo Nation would invest in the project and receive a minority interest when the pipeline opens.  The deal would be structured to limit the tribe's exposure to risks during the construction phase of the project.  Gas from the pipeline could also fuel a proposed Navajo-owned power plant on the reservation.  Red Cedar Gas Gathering, which is jointly owned by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Kinder Morgan made arrangements with the Navajo Indians.

Kinder Morgan is not interested in expanding the equity participants in the Sonoran Pipeline.

Next steps

Kinder Morgan to evaluate providing facilities to serve TW open season markets (SJ, Phoenix, California) along proposed Sonoran Pipeline route and come back to ETS with a proposal (operating lease, undivided interest, no shipper contractual arrangements). 
ETS to identify risks and mitigants associated with Sonoran Pipeline project

DIRECTIONS FROM LISA:

Hello Everyone-  Here are detailed directions to the beach cabin for the
Nov. 30  girl's weekend.


Directions to the Polk Beach Cabin:

Go south on IH-45.

Take the Harborside Dr. exit when you get to Galveston and turn left
under the highway (this is the first exit after crossing the causeway,
so be watching for it).

Travel approx. 6 miles on Harborside Dr. to Ferry Rd.

Turn left on Ferry Rd., go to the end, and catch the ferry to Bolivar (
this is a free drive-on ferry operated by the Texas Hwy Dept.).

After exiting the ferry you will be on Bolivar Peninsula Hwy 87.  Travel
approximately 11.5 miles to the Emerald II edition (the Crystal Beach
water tower is a good land mark when you are getting close and the
Emerald II edition is the first road after the post office).

Turn right into Emerald II (there is a small green sign).  After
entering, turn left on Flamingo, and follow the curve around to
Eastview.  The cabin is on the right about half way down and is located
on the corner of Eastview and Crestview.  The address is 919 Eastview
and ""J.S. Polk"" is written on the side.

The telephone # is 409-684-0195.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone!!

"RE: TW Salt Dome Storage","At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.

SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.  SWG hopes to have a decision to move forward by year end 2001.

As a matter of fact Kevin caught up with me Friday to chat about a peaker facility being investigated near Flagstaff and I asked him about this.  He did not have much info yet but said he was just getting to the point of having an opportunity to look into it......

Subject:	Salt Domes

Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)

Kim,

At one time there was someone in marketing looking at developing salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

August 27, 2001

Dear Participant:

It is our pleasure to welcome you to the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program on October 31 - November 2 at the Doubletree - Travis 1&2 .  The program is designed to help leaders develop the skills necessary to manage direct reports.  The program focuses on participative management skills and has leaders and their reports working together to shape goals, standards, and operating procedures, that I believe you will find both relevant and enjoyable.

Program Details

The program will begin at 8:30 a.m. each day and end at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the first 2 days and at 3:00 p.m. on the third day.  Dress is informal.

Because of the full program schedule, there will be no time for regular business contacts.  Therefore, we ask that you clear your calendar for the 3 days and make arrangements for someone to cover your phone calls.

Preparation Materials

Enclosed is the Preparation Materials booklet that you should read over and bring to the program.

Distributing the Enclosed Questionnaires

As part of your preparation for the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program, you will also be distributing the enclosed questionnaires to your direct reports.  Many leaders spend a lot of time trying to figure out what their direct reports are thinking.  To help answer that question, one of the key components of this program is a confidential survey of your direct report's perceptions of your management skill.  The survey will help you to identify your strengths and determine areas in need of improvement.  You are the only person who will see the survey results, unless you decide to share them.

Distribute one of the enclosed questionnaires to each of the seven direct reports that you have selected.  You may wish to hand deliver each questionnaire so that you can personally explain its purpose.  In doing so you should emphasize that:

The reason you are asking him or her to fill out the questionnaire is to improve the quality of communication and effectiveness of work that transpires between you.

His or her responses are strictly confidential. (The survey report that you will see at the program will be the combined results of all your direct reports.)

The completed questionnaire must be received by the Forum Corporation for scoring no later than October 24th. Please allow 2 weeks for the questionnaire to travel through postal system.

The questionnaire instructions explain that the direct report must fill in the level he or she feels is required in each dimension and the level he or she feel you have attained.

I am confident that your direct reports will be happy to oblige.  The questionnaire should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Please note that a feedback report can only be generated for you when you use the questionnaire that I have assigned to you.  Should you or your direct reports misplace a questionnaire do not use a colleague's ""extras"" or photocopy questionnaires.  The questionnaires that have been assigned to you have a unique coding number which has been assigned specifically for you in order to create a custom feedback report.  The questionnaires assigned to you cannot be duplicated or modified in any valid way without my knowledge.  If you need replacement questionnaires for any reason, please see me and I will provide you with any extra questionnaires you may require.

I look forward to your participation in the program and know you will find it to be an interesting and rewarding experience.  If any questions remain unanswered, give me a call.

Sincerely,


Tom Wilbeck

Subject:	New Mexico Power Plant Project

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

"RE: Transwestern Response to FERC Data Request - USGT Negotiated Rate Filing","
 	I am not sure who prepared the detail schedule for Data Request No. 4, but we have a few questions:

	  The letter agreement dated 2/6/2001, effective November 1, 2001, states 
		1.  Primary points - east to east flow  rate equals $0.025 demand rate and a maximum commodity rate which is 			$0.0147 inclusive of surcharges.   Why does the schedule have $0.0092 as the primary path rate?  Also since the 
		question asks for the transportation charged, we thought we would add the demand rate and the associated MDQ.
		
		2.  Alternate points - east to west flow - rate equals negotiated rate - but in no event shall the resultant commodity be 		less than $0.0246/MMBtu.  Why does the schedule have a rate of $0.0245/MMBtu?

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

I have attached the rev. spreadsheet for your reference.  The Red Rock Adm. Contracted volumes are right for the time period on your xls.

 
Thanks PT  3-0667

Let me know if we're syncing-up.

If we're off in June - Dec, check what I have for the Red Rock Adm Ctrc (I know Dennis made some changes.  I think I have the most current, but possibly not.)

Thanks,
Lindy

"Park-N-Ride Economics","Michelle/Kimberly, I was looking at the economics for Park-N-Rides (on the TW Mainline Leg) thought you might be interested in this:
According to Gary Choquette, it costs us in fuel 1420 Mscf/d for storage of 42,502 Mscf of gas.  Assuming a BTU factor of 1.00 and at a gas cost of $3.00 per MMBTU--fuel costs amount to $4260/day.  Adding O&M to this (assuming 1/3 fuel cost), the total cost of this storage to us is ~13 cents.

"IT Weekly Tip - Save Those Sent Messages","As many of you know, the Outlook mail retention rules have been turned on at the mail server, and all user mailboxes now follow these rules:

Message Location	Maximum Retention
Inbox		30 days
Sent Items Folder	30 days
Trash		Rollover from Inbox for one day
Folders		All eMail messages placed in folders will be destroyed after one calendar year

But what if you regularly view your Sent Items folder to see your past communications?  Are you stuck to only 30 days now?  In the Sent Items folder, YES.  But, luckily, we are still allowed a full year on all other mail folders, so we can easily create a new folder to store our sent mail in which will allow us to keep it for a full year.  We then create a RULE to automatically move the sent mail to it.  Works great!  

Note:  This new folder will be included in your mailbox 100mb size limit!

CREATE NEW FOLDER
Right-click on the top folder in your folder list and select New Folder 
 
Type the name you'd like to give this folder (""Save Sent"" for example)
Click OK

CREATE NEW RULE
Close any open messages, calendar items, etc, so just Outlook is open.
Click Tools, then Rules Wizard 
Click New, then select Check messages after sending 
Click Next
Click Next
When prompted ......Is this correct?, click Yes
Put a check mark next to move a copy to the specified folder
Click the word specified in the lower window
Select the new folder you created earlier and click OK
Click Finish
When prompted, This rule is a client-only rule..... click OK
Click OK

Now, a copy of all messages you send will be in your new folder for reference for a full year.  Enjoy!

Steve,  I just stopped in the office on my way out to the airport and saw this.  I will call you on Monday to discuss so we can give it to Danny quickly.  Will Danny also want something similar on Questar?

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Danny wants to compile and asset development activities in one section for purposes of the upcoming business review with Mark Frevert and Greg Whalley.  I've developed a standard template for my projects (Alaska Highway, Sun Devil, Heat Recovery) and propose you do same for TransPecos.  Here's a rough draft for your consideration.  Please complete and return to me at your earliest convenience, preferably before Monday, close of play.

Thanks-

Eric

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

"Update on Auto Exam Link","Update on Auto Exam Link on EFCU Web Portal

The Auto Exam web site, linked to our web portal, is currently under construction and under normal circumstances should display an error page when selected.  Instead, several external DNS servers were pointing to http://www.zfreehost.com which Enron's  internal DNS servers cached. 

Someone had hacked the zfreehost site and altered their error page to display adult content, so that anyone inside Enron's  firewall who tried to go to Auto Exam was redirected to this page.

Enron IT and Digital Insight are looking into the problem and will bring the link back up when the issue has been resolved.

"Status - Firm Contract Data Request","I have placed the contracted information we discussed in a file called ""TW Firm October 1996.XLS"" on ""S:\MARKETING\TW_FLOW\"".

This file has all of the firm contracts, including capacity release contracts, contracted on or after October 1, 1996. It includes the contracted points and the contracted volume at each point.

I decided to include the capacity release contracts thinking that their rates might show us the market value of the capacity over time. I can easily remove this data if you don't think it will be helpful.

My next steps, as I understand it, are to 1) extract commodity volume, revenue and rate information from the invoiced data for these contracts; and 2) extract a sample of daily flow information from the scheduling system for these contracts for Sean to review.

Please take a look at this data and let me know if it meets your needs, or if you need additional information.

I'll keep working!

"Re: Replacement of J Bolton","Hi,

The new grandbaby Samantha, her mother and father are doing fine. She is on her way home this afternoon if the pediatrician believes that she is ready to be released.

Regarding Jim's resignation, I agree that we should not be pressured into putting anyone on the board that will not assist us in moving forward and handling the complex issues that the board faces this year. Jim indicated that he would wait to resign for as long as he could or until we find a replacement. We can discuss this further tonight. I'm available anytime after 6:30 pm. We could either get together or all go out to dinner at Hungrey's or where ever if that works. Since the candidates to replace Jew Don Bony are coming to the Spires tomorrow night, I would like to attend that meeting if everyone is agreeable.

Let me know what works for this evening with everyone.

Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 

I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated. 

We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks.

"SoCalGas Complaint (Message from Greg Porter)","

MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.  

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.  

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.    

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.

"RE: FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points","According to the copy of the contract I have, under Exhibit A, 

	1. The Rebate.  A portion of CDEC's demand charge associated with CDEC's generation fixed costs shall be avoidable by ECS if Customer operates the Compressor such that ECS is able to avoid placing a load on CDEC's system during certain CDEC coincidental peaks for any applicable month.  To calculate the monthly rebate, the actual demand charges as billed by CDEC will be subtracted from the Billing Demand Basis.  The Billing Demand Basis is the maximum demand charge on 10 MW of peak demand, assuming no peak avoidance during the applicable month.  Thus, the Customer's Rebate shall be a portion of the Billing Demand Basis that ECS is not billed by CDEC as actual demand charges.

The way I interpret this wording, we would be entitled to a demand charge rebate even if we only slow down the unit during the peak period.  I've only a copy of last August's bill, but we used 7.93 MW during Tri-States (CDEC's generation) peak.  At $8.86/kW (generation demand), this would entitle TW to a rebate of $18,340 for the month of August alone.  To me it is unclear if TW is actually receiving this rebate.  I've got Mark Walton looking into the issue.  Note that there is an additional ""transmission demand"" of $3.35 /kW that is coincident with CDEC's peak.  Currently, we have no method of predicting CDEC's peak.  Apparently for the month of August, CDEC's and Tri-State's peaks did not occur at the same time (although there is no specific information on the CDEC bill as to when their demand peak occurred) as the Tri-State peak and CDEC peak demand charges are based on different loads.  Interpretation of the contract language would lead one to believe the rebate would only apply to the demand associated generation, and thus be valued at $8.86/kW.  Even so, if we avoided CDEC's peak, it would be a saving to ECS and thus to Enron.  I understood from James Centilli that the economics were based on avoiding the peak demand 70% of the time (at $8.86/kW or $12.21/kW I don't know).

David, you are correct, we only have to avoid one peak in the month, the problem is predicting which peak is going to be the largest peak in the month.  You don't know for sure on the first day of the month if the load on that day will be higher than the load on the last of the month.  Below is a list Tri-States historical peaks (in MW):

1/3/2000	1114
2/1/2000	1048
3/20/2000	1080
4/3/2000	 977
5/23/2000	1126
6/22/2000	1381
7/7/2000	1888
8/14/2000	1924
9/5/2000	1541
10/23/2000	1296
11/17/2000	1439
12/18/2000	1534
1/30/2001	1516
2/9/2001	1482
3/1/2001	1388
4/22/2001	1251
5/25/2001	1407
6/29/2001	1932
7/31/2001	1939
8/6/2001	2008
9/4/2001	1699

For January 2000 the peak was on the 3rd, in 2001 it was on the 31.  The problem is you don't know for certain which day of the month will have the peak.  The contract did not specify they would only have one peak that they were going to interrupt us on, only that if we avoided their peak (whenever it occurred) we would save in demand charges.

Using the most conservative approach to avoid a demand peak, you would not run at all on the first day of a month (the first day is always a peak day in the month to date). You would only run during the second day when the system load is less than the peak we saw on the first day.  If the system load on the second day is higher than that of the first day, this now becomes the new peak of the month to date.  You would repeat this approach for each subsequent day in the month, shutting down or slowing down for each new peak in the month to date.

The approach I take is a little riskier in that it looks at last years load and 'budget' loads to estimate a 'minimum expected monthly peak'.  It than allows operation of the unit anytime the system load is less than the higher of (1) the actual monthly peak to date and (2) the 'minimum expected monthly peak'.  Thus my utility would let you run for the majority (and possibility all) of the first day and would have fewer peaks during the month than the conservative approach.

You are correct about ECS's obligation in establishing an automated system.  That system has turned into my system.  Sections 3.6 and Article 6 of the contract discuss this topic.  In my mind, ECS did not live up to their end of this agreement.  CDEC didn't do much either, only providing us access to Tri-States web site.  Tri-State changed their web site mid year requiring a change in the automated process (due to file format changes) delaying my implementation.  I offered to take over the automated system sometime around the end of the first quarter this year to force some progress on the issue.  There may me legal recourse available to recover some past demand charges due TW from ECS.

By my calculation/contract interpretation, the maximum rebate TW could receive is $8.86/kW * 10,000kW/Month * 12 Months/Year = $1,063,200/year.

Gary you are correct in your assesment that we can avoid electrical power demand charges if we shut down during power utilities pear power period.  However, in discussions prior to finalizing this contract, I got the impression that a decision had been made that we MUST shut the unit down during peak demand periods or the econimics of the project did not come out.  (these discussions included: Mike Nelson, Rich Jolly, Mary Kay Miller, Dave Fotti, Ben Asante, D. Schoolcraft, James Centelli, Kevin Hyatt etc....)

Second:  The issue came up of ""What about during tariff months?"", can we still shut down during peak demand periods.  Again, if I remember correctly, the answer was, Yes, even during tariff months we don't have a choice we would have to shut down.  

Third:  I was under the impression that from a risk standpoint we would not have to deal with more than ONE peak demand period in the month.

Fourth:  ECS was responsible for working with the CDEC to establish an automated system which would read CDEC's online load profile and convert the reading into a signal which would automatically control the loading on the Compressor and Motor (which would provide us with the opportunity to avoid the CDEC's peak load periods).  TW of course would have an override option.  However, I was also under the impression that ECS would hold TW harmless & reimburse, if this feature was not provided.  

I may be interpreting this incorrectly but again the CSA specifies ECS's obligation in helping us avoid the demand energy charge.  The demand charge is $12.21 * 10,000 KW  * 12 Months = $1.465,200 of potential rebate back to TW each year.

Subject:	RE: FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points

As I understand/interpret the Gallup contract, we can completely avoid electrical power demand charges (approximately $42,000 per month) if we do not run the unit during the power utilities peak power period.  If we can not shut down the unit, we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period.

Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day (5-7 PM), Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day.  Through access to Tri-States history data, I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be.  I can look at the current day's usage and estimate if today's peak will be higher than the higher of (1) my estimated peak or (2) the actual peak so far this month.  If so, the ""Probability today is a peak"" will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today.   The ""Probability now is peak"" approached 100 when an actual peak is underway.  The Tri-State Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway.

Note that it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak.  If the first day of the month has an estimated peak 1000 and last years peak for the same month, was 985.  It appears possible that this will be a power peak day.  Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was 1010.  Now on the second day of the month, the estimated peak is 965, not likely to be a power peak day.  The third day has an estimated peak of 1005, a possible power peak day.  If the actual for the third day is 1012, it now becomes the new peak for the month.  If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below 1012, they are not likely to be power peaks, and unit turndown is not required.

The point is, to completely avoid demand charges, we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month, and also on the third day.  The utility integrates their peak over a 30 minute period, thus the minimum time the unit could be down.  I'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month.

So far this month, I guessed a power peak on 10/1/01 starting at 20:18 and ending at 21:05.  The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was 10/1/01 starting at 20:30 lasting to 21:00.


I'm sorry for any confusion.  I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators.  If there are any additional questions, do not hesitate to call me at 87-7546.

"EPNG Format Reporting"," 

Lorna,

Thanks for the information you provided!

Here is an outline for reporting format purposes. 

I have added some additional points that should have impact to TW and or NNG (interconnect and delivery points).  Some of the other points are constraint points on the system. Do you have an idea as to how to break them out by category differently from how they are?

Also, I was wondering what points the Keystone West and Waha Del include in the ENA format?

Some additional types of information to potentially include are highlighted in yellow.

Any suggestions on additional points or further information you would like to see would be appreciated.  This will be a work in progress!!  

Thanks for your help and call me if you have any questions.

Theresa

"FW: TransPecos Deal","Kim:
Well, I am now officially over in Rod Hayslett's group!  He had mentioned to me last Friday about your TransPecos deal as a potential source of cash for Enron (presumably through a monetization of cash flows from Pemex) - do you have some time to discuss or some material that I could take a look at over the holidays?

Thanks,

Kevin

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

"RE: TW Salt Dome Storage","Kim - Yes, good timing.  Kevin and I visited SWG on 10/18 about Sun Devil as well as their Pataya storage project.  As far as Pataya is concerned, SWG has a potential partner under a confidentiality agreement (which must ""bear fruit or die"") so they are unable to discuss too much with us as far as TW/Enron getting in the game.  SWG is looking for $150 MM of capital in this project.  After taking a look at the initial costs, etc. of Pataya, SWG thinks the costs for the APS/EP Copper Eagle storage look higher than Pataya.  They are still on track for a decision by the end of this year.  I'll keep you posted.

At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.

SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.  SWG hopes to have a decision to move forward by year end 2001.

Subject:	Salt Domes

Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)

Now that we are bobbing up for air from Red Rock, I wanted to investigate this a little further.  I have not found anyone from Marketing who recalls looking at a potential salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  Are you familiar with anything that may be happening on this?

Kim,

At one time there was someone in marketing looking at developing salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Steve - In response to your previous questions regarding customers behind SWG.  SWG's largest customers are power plants.

	Nevada Power (still owns generation)
	El Dorado (Reliant and Sempra)
	Nevada Cogen Assoc. (NCA1 & 2) (partially owned by Texaco)
	Saguro Power Plant (NRG partially owns)
	Las Vegas Cogen (Enron involved?)
	
Parties who are either planning to build new power plants or are already building power plants in the Southern Nevada area include
Mirant
Reliant
Calpine
PG&E

APS/Pinnacle West was among the buyers of one of Nevada Power's plants before dereg in NV was postponed.

Please let me know if you need other info.

Subject:	TW OBAs Calling for Volumetric Settlement

Lee, as I mentioned on Friday, the purpose of the attached letter is to terminate the volumetric OBAs and revert to the tariff OBA to avail ourselves of the ""hammer"" in Section 4(b) of the tariff form (Sheet 147) which permits us to credit the operators' scheduled volumes to the imbalance, ie, confiscate their gas.  I'm told that the subject OBAs were individually negotiated and deviate from the tariff in one way or another.  They also said that these OBAs allow cashout, but don't require it, and that's the problem:  The operators are not voluntarily paying back the gas because in many locations (ie, San Juan), the pipeline is full and they don't want to short their markets.  Because I haven't seen any of the agreements that we propose to terminate (the TW people have just finished briefing them), I told the group that an attorney needs to look at each one to make sure that we cannot, in fact, force cashout.  In most of them, I'm told, cashout is at the option of the party owing the imbalance.  

As I also mentioned, this letter is a template; a starting point.  It must be tailored to each OBA being terminated. For example, the Section numbers are not filled in, and must be supplied. You will note in the second paragraph of the letter that we say, essentially, that in capacity-constrained area, if volumetric settlement is to occur, it will need to be accomplished through crediting their scheduled volumes to the imbalance.  From my conversations with TW, my understanding is that most of the volumetric OBAs do not have a provision expressly permitting us to do that.  Indeed, as I mentioned above, that's my understanding of why we're terminating the volumetric OBAs.  Even if there is no provision in the subject OBAs for crediting scheduled volumes, my opinion is that we can offer that as an option, because that is still a way of balancing ""in kind"", but omit the reference to the agreement (as I have noted with brackets).  If they don't want to do that, cashout is the only other option; that's our way of forcing cashout.  


Thanks for your help, and if you need help, you might ask Maria or Dari.  However, I don't envision that it will take much time to do any one letter.................Tony

"FW: New hook up request","Mark
This is Planning's response to your request of 10/10/2001 regarding two new gas wells hook up into TW's system.
The two wells were as follows:

SE/4 of Section 20- 23S-27E Eddy County, NM 

This well is located near Sid Richardson gathering system and approximately 4.4 miles to the suction side of the TW- Keystone Compressor Station.
The suction pressure at Keystone is 525-575 psig.
Are they interested to build up to 4.5 miles of pipe to TW? If they are what is pressure/maximum volume that this well can produce?


Center of Section 22-Block B-3 PSL Winkler County Texas

This well is located approximately .3-.5 mile to TW-Crawford 16"" lateral. The Crawford lateral line pressure is 680-720 psig.
Can this well meet TW's line pressure ? what is the maximum flow rate on this well?


Please share this information with your customer and let me know about your response on this project?

Gina -regarding TW's Gallup Project:  
 In-service dates were: Bloomfield -4/6/2000; LaPlata ""A"" -4/20/2000; and Gallup -5/1/2000 (Sempra protest delayed the issuance of certificate until 1/13/2000).  
10,000 HP was added at the Gallup Compressor Station; coolers and not compression were constructed at Bloomfield and LaPlata which reduced the temperature of the gas flowing in the San Juan Lateral.  This reduction in temperature caused the lateral and associated down field compressors to operate more efficiently creating an incremental 50,000 Mcf per day of firm capacity on the  Blanco to Thoreau segment of the San Juan Lateral.  The project enabled Transwestern to maintain its mainline operating pressure from Thoreau west to California at 950 psig at all times thereby accommodating shifts in market demand to the east without restricting delivery capacity to California.  As a result, TW is able to once again operate its mainline west of Thoreau at its certificated capacity of 1,090,000.
Total final costs filed with FERC were $13 million.  As stated in the original application, the project was funded with internally generated funds.
Please talk to Drew regarding the rates.
The shipper data is correct.   All the contract terms are for five years with the exception of El Paso Energy at 5 1/2 years and North Star Steel which expires on March 31, 2008.
As the Commission observed in the January 13 Order, ECS is not a jurisdictional company; whereas the motor that they would own is a jurisdictional facility.  Transwestern was therefore instructed to restructure its relationship with ECS so that Transwestern would have sufficient control over the motor to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation.  Transwestern and ECS signed an Operational Control Agreement obligating Transwestern to assume operational control over the motor with respect to all facilities and activities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.  DREW -ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

Sarah,

As we discussed, Inside FERC has lost track of current information on a couple
of Enron projects for our online Pipeline Tracker service. As you can see below,
the questions are quite basic.

One, Northern Natural East Leg 2000 was scheduled to go into service in Nov.
'99, but at some point had a delay. I'd like to know if and when it went into
service; if it was built under blanket authority or was it certificated*; if it
indeed runs 264 miles from Iowa to Illinois and if so, what is the diameter; how
much did it cost, $300 million?; if it has a postage stamp rate, and if so, what
is it?; who are the shippers?; and with whom does it compete?

* If that's the case, please provide the docket number.

For the other, Transwestern Gallup, I'd like to know if it went into service
Feb. 1, 2000, as planned; how much compression was added at the Bloomfield and
LaPlata ""A"" stations (or anywhere else for this project); if it added 140,000
Mcf/day, bringing the mainline to 1.09 Bcf/day; if it cost $11.6 million as
projected and if internal funds were used; and what are the rates, which FERC
ordered the company to disclose. We had the shippers listed as follows: Duke
Energy Trading and Marketing LLC, 40,000 Mcf/day; El Paso Energy Marketing Co.,
40,000 Mcf/day; Southern Energy Inc., 25,000 Mcf/day; Sempra Energy Trading
21,500 Mcf/day; Reliant Energy Services Inc., 10,000 Mcf/day and North Star
Steel Co., 3,500 Mcf/day. Is that data still correct and what is the duration of
the deals? Five years? Also, in approving the project, FERC ordered Transwester
to restructure its relationship with Enron Compression Services Co., which was
to be the owner of the project; how was that structured?

"FW: Asset Purchase","
Please add Jim Curry to your list.  He should be part of the due diligence team.  I will let you know as others are identified.  Will this be a regulatory asset purchase and are there any regulatory issues?  If you don't know, don't worry,  I have a call to Teb Lokey.

I think that property tax needs to be involved in the review to satisfy ourselves that all is current relative to the assets being purchased.  Where will the data room be located?  Jim Curry will be the ad val contact.

FYI,

TW commercial, Kim Watson is looking to pull together a due diligence team to review an ETS bid to purchase a 209 mile 16"" oil pipeline from Questar.  The 209 mile pipeline runs from the border of California to Long Beach and is currently packed with nitrogen, which means that it isn't currently being used by Questar.  This will be an asset acquisition and cost between $5 - $10 million. I have requested that we be kept current on the status but don't see the need to attend the data room (Asset purchase).  I will contact Jennifer Kennedy, Jerry Moore, Gavin Russo and Warren Schick with this email to make sure that there are no state income, franchise tax, sales and use or ad valorem tax issues.

Please let me know your thoughts, or if you believe that we should attend the data room.

Robert

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"SoCal RLS Tariff/peaking rates","Attached below is a complete copy of the CPUC's Order on SoCal's RLS Tariff for peaking rates for bypass customers.  There are some differences in the final order as opposed to the proposed decision previously issued such as the addition of an interruptible rate.  In summary the Order contains the following provisions:

1.  Two rates were adopted.  A firm cost-based peaking rate and an interruptible peaking rate.

2.  The firm cost-based peaking rate will include the following components:
	a.  A monthly customer charge to collect the cost of customer-related facilities. 
		Actual rate will be dependent on type of customer ranging from $800 to $19,000.
	b.  A volumetric Public Purpose Program surcharge based on Commission approved rates.
	c.  A monthly reservation rate calculated using the currently authorized end-use customer class rate times the MDQ.
	

3.  The interruptible peaking rate has been set at 150% of SoCalGas' default tariff rate at a 100% load factor.

4.  Firm and inter. customers will pay a volumetric rate to collect the Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, Sempra-wide rate charge
     and any other similar types of surcharges.

5.  Other provisions include: customers are subject to daily balancing, interruptible customers are not eligible for Service Interruption
     Credits and the tariff will apply on a facility-by-facility basis.

SoCal was ordered to submit modified cost-based tariff sheets within 10 days of the order (Due 8/12/01).  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  gh

"Alstom Motor - Gallup Station","The status of the Gallup motor is as follows.  I will try to keep everyone updated as I find answers to any questions.
Please feel free to call me at 505-238-6099

The motor is in the IRS shop in Farmington NM and has had the exciter and rotor removed.  It is to the point that you can get inside and look at some of the damage but until the stator is torn down we will not be able to see anymore.  This will be a destructive move and we don't want to start this until a final decision has been made as to the process of repairing the stator.

The stator is damaged to the extent of rewinding the motor in the opinion of the Alstom rep.
The opinion of the shop foreman at IRS is that they can repair the motor but it will take 2 weeks to make the coils and 4 weeks to install them.
The other option is to see what can be done at Rugby England.
The following letter was sent to Alstom in Rugby along with some attachments of resin properties that we have on site. Paul Savory is going to contact them at 1:00am MST and discuss this with them.  I have set up a conference call on our bridge for 6:30am in hopes to get some of these questions answered.
The number is 877-795-3687  Pin  844699


The following is a copy of the letter that Paul Savory of Alstom sent his people in England.

The motor has been stripped at the IRS workshop at Farmington, New Mexico.
1 phase breaks down at around500V. The fault appears to be at the bottom of a slot, approximately 1/3 of the way down the core. Therefore it would seem that the motor needs a rewind.
Therefore there are several questions that Enron would like answers to urgently.
1 - IRS have told Enron & myself that they can manufacture new coils, strip & rewind the core & VPI the windings but this is obviously providing that we approve. attached is the spec. from the resin they use at their workshop.
2 - Would we supply a person to oversee the strip & rewind especially as Enron want to know why the motor has failed.
3 - What is the time scale for manufacture & delivery of coils from the UK.
4 - What is the time scale for a fully wound core from the UK.
5 - Is there another similar motor available that we can supply.
Please keep in mind that this motor has to meet the same criteria if it is rewound & VPI impregnated here
i.e. same rating, horsepower etc.
Please respond by E-Mail to Todd.Ingalls@enron.com
A conference call has been set up for 0630 hours USA time, Monday 27/8/01, which is 1330 hours UK time.
Please arrange for whoever is necessary to sit in.
You will have to call USA 877 795 3687. After this you will be asked to enter a pin No: - 844699. You will then be in on the conference.
Should you have any problems please call Todd Ingalls on US 505 238 6099

"Index to Index Capacity Charge","
Kim,

Thank you for your time on Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting you and appreciated the discussion regarding pipeline economics.

I was thinking about the capacity you sold in 2003 on an Index to Index basis. On the attached diagram, the boxes colored black represent my understanding of your current position (you are locked-in to $1.00/MMBtu for the Calif. Border Index minus San Juan Index but exposed to San Juan Basin gas prices for the fuel required to deliver 20,000 MMBtu/d to the Calif. Border). You can easily lock-in your cost of fuel gas as shown by the swap colored in red. I believe that you did this capacity trade when gas prices were higher, therefore you could fix your fuel cost at today's lower prices and earn a higher margin on your capacity sale than originally expected. 

The decision to unwind the Index to Index hedge that you did with ENA is a tougher call. The unwind would be accomplished by the swap colored blue. Which do you prefer: 1. $1.00/MMBtu or 2. $0.40 + (Calif. Border minus San Juan Indices) per MMBtu ? Unwinding at $0.60/MMBtu, you must believe that Calif. Border Index minus San Juan Index will be greater than $0.60/MMBtu. I am not very familar with those pricing points so I can not give an educated opinion.

Anyway, I hope that this is useful. Talk to you later.

Paul

"ALERT FOR LAPTOP USERS","
WARNING:  Laptop AC Adapter Recall Program

This recall and replacement program only affects AC adapters on laptop systems with the listed Model Series Number (second list below), not the notebook computers themselves.  We ask that all laptop users in the ETS environment check the number on their AC adapter, and notify us by return email if any of the three model series numbers appear just under the COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION name.  We will centrally manage the replacement of your adapter to insure the replacement adapter is ordered and installed.

In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Compaq Computer Corporation announced a worldwide voluntary recall and replacement program for approximately 1.4 million AC adapters used with certain commercial notebook computer products.  Compaq customers affected by this recall and replacement program will be eligible to receive a replacement AC adapter for each recalled adapter.  These AC adapters were distributed worldwide in notebooks, as separate options, and as replacement spares for the following notebooks:
 
?          Armada M300
?          Armada 100s
?          Armada M700
?          Armada 110
?          Armada E500
?          Prosignia 170
?          Armada E500s
?          Prosignia 190
?          Armada V300
?          Notebook 100
?          Armada 3500
 
This recall and replacement program involves AC adapters made by only one of the multiple manufacturers used by Compaq; thus, not every notebook computer listed above will be affected by the recall.  The affected AC adapters can be identified by the adapter Model Series Number located directly under the Compaq Computer Corporation name on the AC adapter label.  
 
?          Model Series PPP003SD 
?          Model Series PPP003
?          Model Series PP2012

Dennis has asked me to follow up on this project.
Please send me an e-mail explaining the project in terms of the location of this gas, Sid's operating pressure& volume conditions. Is this going to be a receipt or delivery at TW's system?. Are you requesting for a scope and cost estimate to tie this gas to TW ?

"RE: ETS  - Investor Questions","Tracy:

I recalculated combined throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for the West & East markets.

I used the throughput for West & East markets vs. contracted capacity (1090 West; 660 East, total 1750).
Below is what I came up with.

Qestion 3:  84% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD.

Tracy:

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the office.

We have some investors who are interested in knowing more about the pipes.  Can you please tell me who can anwser/confirm the following:

1.  Per the latest rate cases the nominal ROE's and related capital structures are as follows:


	ROE				12.89%	12.18%	13.49%
	Equity Ratio(equity to debt)	60%	60%	42%

2. Is rate base calculated on equity or assets?

3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?

It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon. 

Thanks!

"WTX Pool Capacity","I don't know if Perry has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with WTX Pool capacity and about that Duke contract you mentioned in our Staff Mtg yesterday, but I looked at my notes and this is what I come up with.

The Duke contract that expires 7/31/2002 without ROFR is already taken into consideration as expired in the November, 2002 capacity of 17,300/d we derived last week (which we've already sold 20,000/d to Calpine & PPL).

Other contracts expiring in 2002 & early 2003 from the WTX Pool are:

	25841	PG&E	17,200/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	26511	PG&E	  8,165/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	Total		25,365/d

	26683	APS	8,000/d		3/31/2003	(subject to ROFR)
		
Otherwise, we have WTX Pool capacity every Apr-Oct of 14,000/d (opposite of SWG's seasonal ctrc).

The other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement.  For the month of November, 2002 (for example) we have 22,000/d of capacity we are including in our WT-1 total that is made up of southward paths (20,000/d for USGT & 2,000/d for Astra with receipts north of WT-1 for delivery to WTX delivery points south of WT-2).  This is the most conservative capacity reservation policy.  In the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of WT-1 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of WT-1, we would need to compress gas south through WT-1 to make deliveries for these two contracts.  We may want to reassess this.

Rob Cooper (of US Gypsum) asked me to send him an email concerning our decision to not to force USG to provide the remaining 8 months of LOC and also asked me to verify a couple of other points.  Below is my reply.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Paul, please provide the dollar amount needed in the blank below.
______________________________________________________________--

Rob,

After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims, we will not proceed in seeking the additional $___________ letter of credit (worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges).  The current letter of credit valued at $__________ is sufficient.

Also, our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1, 2002.  In our latest discussions with SOCAL, they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time.  It would probably be best for you to discuss this with them yourself to verify its availability completely and thoroughly.

Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Best regards,

Mark

"Calpine Cost Estimates","I spoke with Earl regarding the cost differences indicated for the Calpine -Topock interconnect.  The project files were discarded when the E&C Group moved to 3 Allen Center due to lack of storage capacity.  But Earl recalled that Jim Tucker said that the scope change was done at the request of Marketing which explains the two work order forms that you have.  E&C does not initiate project scope changes unless directed.

Since Calpine was supposed to ""? install measuring station to Enron specs"", the scope change items and labor (for EFM/RTU, battery backup, SCADA, and radio comm.) would have been provided by Calpine in the original work order for $68,900.  However, it is my presumption that Calpine felt that the scope change items were exotic and more suitable for Enron to handle directly; therefore, the scope change items may have been requested by Calpine to be furnished and installed by Enron at the revised work order amount of $113,900.  This type of scope change would have been consulted and approved by Marketing representation (Jeff Fawcett - Calpine rep.) prior to initiating the scope change work order.

Subject:	Questar Southern Trails Interconnect - San Juan Co., NM

The legal description for the proposed Southern Trails interconnect north of the Blanco Hub is Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, San Juan County, NM.  This is on the old NWPL receipt line coming off the 30"" Ignacio - Blanco line into the Blanco Hub upstream of the El Paso Blanco measurement.  Bottom line is it's the same place we talked about earlier this week.

"Italy car and ferry","I have 2 Alamo full size 4 dr/5 passenger  cars reserved for you. We do not
have to prepay. The all-inclusive
rate is 1,617250. ITL (approx 742.00) for the 12 days. This includes
collision and theft insurance, taxes and
unlimited mileage. I think that this is very good. 1 car booked under John
Watson and 1 under Dennis Dye.
They are manuals.

The ferry from Palermo to Naples is daily, departing at 800pm, arriving
700am. It looks as though the vehicles will cost between 111,600 and 134,600
each. The passengers in a double outside cabin are 96,500 to 111,500. ) I
believe, per passenger.

The ferry from Palermo to Livorno departs at 1100pm and arrives the next day
about 5pm. The double outside suite is
240,000. The coach seat is 120,000. Each car is 175,000 to 205,000. I need
to verify if the cabin rate includes the
passenger fee.

I had found a ferry to Salerno, but it only operates 1 day a week, not the
day you need.
I'll get back to you.

"Summary of NOI","
Attached is an executive summary of the NOI on Electronic Service of Documents, RM01-11. Essentially, FERC wants to expand service electronically to allow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for interventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings. FERC is making two proposals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals for a cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics).

Comments are due November 2. Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for our pipelines. Let me know who you wish to participate.

"RE: Question","
Howdy Miss Kim,

Bet you can wait to say Ariva Derchi and see Italy?  Where abouts are you
going?  Two of my sisters went to Northern Italy a year ago and had a great
time.

We had rain everyday in Scotland, but it was still so beautiful.  One night
we stayed on the coast of the Irish Sea and saw there was a ferry about a
half-a-block down the street so checked out where we could go.  Ended up
taking a high speed ferry across the Irish Sea to Larne and did a day trip
of the Irish Coast.  Fantastic.

We did a small cruise boat on Loch Ness, a tour bus, a double decker bus,
the train, the ferry and the tube!  The second to the last day we drove to
Gatwick, drop the car in short term parking and got a student pass  (must
look younger than we thought) and took the train to Victoria Station.
Walked over to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park and Piccadilly Circus.  Took the
underground to the Tower.  Hadn't been there since 1972 (probably the year
you were born).  They have cleaned the entire outside of the tower and it
looks fabulous.  All the displays have been reworked and everything was so
interesting.  Could easily have spent an entire day there.

We're coming down the end of November for Mr. Matt's 1st birthday.  Mark,
Michelle and Matt are arriving Aug 29 and leaving Sept 2.  We did get to see
them on our layover on the way back from England.  They met us at the
airport and we went to Pappasitos.  Nothing like being up 20 hours and
eating chips and salsa.

Have a wonderful time.

Take care - hugs,

M

What is the usual process on something like this?  Do we get a chance to respond to the protest before the FERC makes a decision on whether to hold a Tech Conf?  What is the timeline for any other protests to come in?  What is the timeline for FERC to decide?

For your info, we have received a protest and or reguest for Tech Conference or hearing from the CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001.  they raise the market power issue, the pricing, the volume, the policy of market based rates.  We expect a similar protest from IS, and also the issue regarding the alternate point use.  The volume on this transaction is for 400,000 per day with the negotiated rate provision only relating to the alternate path to Calif.   More to come.

It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several ""packages"" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).  If it was a fax or other document or a script, we need to get our hands on it.  Kevin, Lorraine, TK, Susan--does anyone remember which it was or know how to get our hands on it?  

If we are going to be in a dogfight with BP on these deals, lets make sure we go in armed with as much of the relevant information as possible to demonstrate we were following the rules.  DF

"RE: Fuel Risk on Index to Index Deals","Kim,

The book should reflect that as long as the spread is positive we will be long actual fuel multiplied times the Dynegy volume.  If the spread covers fuel, we will be long the Dynegy volume plus the additional volume. (approximately 20,000).

Subject:	Fuel Risk on Index to Index Deals

Steve and Dave,

As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index deals.  Here are my thoughts...

For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 could impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for this transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract will have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approximately 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over collected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have something less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collection.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assume after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seasonally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal.  

It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d of the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually burned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind fuel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actually used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not have additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity loss on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provided by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this particular day.  Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash prices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a price that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunity loss.  

Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?  Would you agree that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow?  

Thanks, Kim.

"Enron Kids Adopt A Child Program","


 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

"Questar","Kim
Monday I will be on vacation.
I have listened to the message from Questar and it seems like that the Morongo Valley area ( with R.O.W issues) is a few miles away 
from the SOCAL interconnect. 
The distance from Needles to SOCAL interconnect is approximately 90 miles. The horse power requirements to handle up to
100 mmcf/d from Needles to SOCAL is around 2,500 hp.

Based on the above, and also assuming that SOCAL has the capacity to handle up to 100 mmcf/d at a pressure of 850 psig
at this location, the conversion/ compression cost is as follows:


Conversion costs for 90 miles:		 $9,000,000 

Compression cost:		           	 $6,000,000	

Total costs				$15,000,000

Note: As we have discussed before this cost is based on EE&CC cost estimate of 1997 plus 5% escalation for each year.

This was just issued late last week and published today.  I'm still in the process of reviewing it but the good news is that he is proposing the adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement which Transwestern helped design and supported along with most other participants.  The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions.  Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001.

Kevin,

As a follow up to our recent discussions concerning the SoCalGas RLS or
peaking rate, I am forwarding to you the proposed decision of ALJ Brown.  My
understanding is that at yesterday's Commission meeting the Commission made
a decision to approve a change to the current peaking rate tariff.  I should
have their decision within a couple working days.  I am forwarding their
draft decision.

The expected PD rate design for the new peaking rate would include SFV rate
design principals, demand charges determined over highest recorded usage
over a 12 month period, and inclusion of public purpose program charges.  At
this point we'll call it a modified cost of service approach.

If you have any questions, please call.

FYI.  Here is a report for the July Capacity Releases on TW.  PG&E, Sempra and Texaco all released on an Index to Index spread and are above max rate.  Elizabeth has the history of TW Capacity Releases if you think it might help in the preparation of our strategy for negotiated rates.  
 
Thanks, Kim.

Subject: Transwestern Capacity Release Report - 7/2001



Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides billing information for July 2001 reservation invoices.  

Please be advised that the PG&E (Core) releases exceeded the maximum tariff rate as summarized below (the first three were special calculations based on index spreads and the last one was a fixed rate):

PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation           60,000/day * 31 days * $0.7081 = $1,317,066.00 
Sempra Energy Trading Corp.                           15,000/day * 31 days * $1.9951 = $   927,721.50 
Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.                                  50,000/day * 31 days * $0.7468 = $1,157,540.00

Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC        25,000/day * 31 days * $1.1600 = $  899,000.00

These amounts will be billed to the acquiring shippers and once payments are received, PG&E will subsequently receive reimbursement.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

 

Thanks,

Elizabeth

This is the equipment for the proposed interconnect. The Enron ""e""nternet is down at this time and I will e-mail your the Engineering Standards when it is running. Jim Williams will be here this PM and I will give him a typical I/C package drawing and Material list set that you can review. This is a typical set and for your proposed I/C, a few modifications to package would be required but it is 80% of what is used at most I/C. 

You can develop a cost estimate from this package with your modifications. 

If any questions or if I can be of assistance, please contact me.

The I/C is a 10"" UltraSonic designed for a range of 35 mmcfd to +100 mmcfd. 
By using the US meter, this allows a wide range of volumes without changing out the tube when Agave want to increase the volumes.

"RE: Transwestern Off-system Transportation Contract T39817","Lorraine,

	Thanks for forwarding the attached message. The way I read this, PSNM is effectively withdrawing its demand for the collateral as long as we don't use the contract. We should probably send them a letter confirming that this is the case. I would suggest that you just send an e-mail in response stating that what PSNM has proposed is acceptable and that our understanding is that PSNM will not require collateral as long as we don't utilize the contract. Therefore, PSNM's demand for collateral by December 15 is, based on our understanding, withdrawn. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

I talked to my Supervisor and here is what we can do, PNMGS will not accept or confirm any nominations under Off-System Transportation Contract T39817.  This will put the Contract in an ""INACTIVE"" status instead of total Termination of the Contract.
Prior to any  future expectation of Off-system Transportation, pursuant to Contract T39817 between PNMGS and TWPC, there will then be an updated and current determination on the Financial Responsibility as set forth under ARTICLE XII. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.   PNMGS will then decide what, if any, steps will need to be taken prior to such Off-system Transportation.

Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Summary of Commission Meeting","

The Commission meeting yesterday, chaired by Pat Wood, consisted of discussions on FERC's:

Administrative Issues
?	Strategic and 2002 Business Plan
Priorities for the strategic plan for 2001 through 2005 were outlined yesterday and include a) promoting secure, high-quality environmentally responsible energy infrastructure with consistent policies; b) encouraging competitive markets in lieu of traditional regulation; c) protection of markets/customers through fair market oversight; and d) efficiently running FERC. In reaching these goals, FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impediments to market investment, encouraging use of new technology; continuing to advance competitive markets; addressing landowner, safety and environmental concerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as cost recovery but also in communications to stakeholders. Shortly, Staff will be recommending a twelve-month plan as part of the overall strategic plan.
?	Infrastructure Adequacy
There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the U.S. beginning in November in the West; in December or early spring a meeting will be held in the northeast and later in 2002 for the Midwest and south. The intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion.
?	California Infrastructure Update
Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for take-away capacity was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity. The California Energy Commission released a report on September 24 that agrees that more expansion in California is needed. 

Constraint Study
FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be completed by November 7, 2001. Staff cited constraints in central New York state and California. Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or recommendations. It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the resulting costs to consumers.

RTO
FERC is imposing additional ""incentives"" to encourage the formation or joining in RTOs. The Midwest, Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered at a FERC meeting in October. There will be a series of meetings in ""RTO week"" to focus on congestion management, cost recovery, marketing monitoring, transmission planning, reliability standards and transmission rights. A NOPR is expected to be issued on market design and structure.

Marketing Affiliate NOPR, RM01-10
The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both natural gas pipelines and electric utilities. Under the proposal, transmission providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The rules would be codified in a new section of the regulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all ""energy affiliates.""  The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusion of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) from the definition of energy affiliates.    

The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of the rule to public utilities' native load merchant functions.      

Option A:  Status Quo - the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merchant function.
Option B:  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and would prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of the utility. 

After extensive discussion, the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional language added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may not be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties and the States.

Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the definition of ""energy"" affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affiliates that would be exempt. Staff responded that the emphasis is on broadening the definition to include all ""energy affiliates"" and no energy-type marketing affiliates would be exempt, except RTO's.

The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certain information to all ""energy affiliates"".  The rules do not directly govern energy affiliates, but they govern the disclosure of information and the separation of transmission employees, officers and directors from other businesses. 

Under the proposal, waivers may be requested, if operationally required or under emergency protocols particularly for small systems.

Gas Pipeline Operational Flow
FERC has tabled this item for the next public meeting on October 11.

"RE: Big Sandy Delivery Point Construction and Operating Agreement - Revised","Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a ""permit"" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their ""ducks in a row"" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.
Kirk

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.

"USGT Negotiated Rate Filing/ Response to CPUC Protest","Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 

I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated. 

We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Tracy:

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the office.

We have some investors who are interested in knowing more about the pipes.  Can you please tell me who can anwser/confirm the following:

1.  Per the latest rate cases the nominal ROE's and related capital structures are as follows:


	ROE				12.89%	12.18%	13.49%
	Equity Ratio(equity to debt)	60%	60%	42%

2. Is rate base calculated on equity or assets?

3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?

It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon. 

Thanks!

	Mark: The following are certain Right-of-Way needs and/or questions.

	1. Are the ROW records located in Salt Lake City or Long Beach, CA?
	
	2. Does Questar have a ROW data base? If so, can they prepare a report, which would identify product limitation (i.e. Crude Oil specific), multiple line rights, pipeline size limitations, assignability, consent, etc.

	3. An Encroachment report.

	4. A Rental/Term report.

	5. A report identifying any known curative problems.

	6. Can they identify whether the following problems that existed in 1997 have been cured?
		
		a. BLM issues RE: Contract Purchasers vs. Land Patents
		b. Pipeline lies outside of defined R/W in certain locations
		c. Railroad licenses sold to municipal entities that may have required new terms and rental amounts
		d. Relocations
			i. Anaheim Hills
			ii. Morongo Indian Tribe (possible Union Pacific Railroad R/W longitudinal occupation vs. private)
		e. Franchise Agreements

	7. Will new pipe be required for connection of Four Corners pipeline to existing Transwestern pipeline system? If so, would this be across the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation in Mohave County, AZ?

	It is my understanding that this due diligence will not involve the balance of Arizona, which includes the Navajos', Hopis' and the Bennett Freeze area (disputed tribal lands). Is this correct?

Rich / Rick,

Operations & the Gas Controllers didn't know about this till yesterday, when alarms started to appear in Houston.
I'm not sure what is expected from operations. In the last paragraph of Gary's letter, he indicates shutting down
for 30 minutes, 7 times a month. Is that what he is saying? Let us know what you find out.

Subject:	FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points



We have added some point to the Scada database that are provided to us
by Gary Choquette's Peak Power Predictor.  His message below describes
their function better than I would.

I've listed the points below with their descriptions, alarm value(s) and
comment.

Although these points are listed with the other Analog/Discrete points,
they are not coming from the field RTU.  They will act like normal
points so it's easy to put them together.  For those using the intranet
""Adhoc"" reports, they will show up on that.  The key is that the
Discretes that we receive from Gary all end in "".CC"" and the Analogs end
in "".SC"".  We also try to include the (CLC) in the description to depict
that the information is coming from the Closed Loop Control Systems.


Register	Description				Alarm Value
Gary's Comments

GALP.1901.CC	Tri-State Data Old - site Unavail (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Alarm 		(can not retrieve data from Tri-States site)
GALP.1902.CC	Tri-State Calc Off-Line / Data Error (CLC) 	0 =
Normal, 1 = Alarm 		(utility is off-line or error in the
data)
GALP.1903.CC 	Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Peak 		(a power peak is currently in progress)

GALP.7901.SC	Probability % Today is Peak (CLC)     HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that today is likely to be a power
peak day.
GALP.7902.SC  Probability % Now is Peak (CLC)       HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that a power peak is active now.
GALP.7903.SC	Peak Time (hour.min) (CLC)


Please let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks,

Angela Sayegh

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of October 28, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks ?

   Already I have heard from a number of folks what an outstanding job
Michael Butera did yesterday in the Ordinary Life gathering. He always
does. It is impossible to provide a summary of what he did. Though he
speaks from deep preparation, little of what he says is on paper. There
will be a tape available of his presentation.

   His topic was fear and how to deal with it. These are certainly
fearful times.

   This seems to be true on both personal and global levels.

   On my own personal level, the eye surgeon discovered scar tissue
growing on my retina last week. This is a possible side-effect of the
surgeries I've had. If this scar tissue can't be dealt with by
medication, I'll have to have more eye surgery.

   On our national and global levels, things are out of control.

   Let me recommend to you a couple of resources to draw on for these
troubling times.

   One is a book that you might want to be reading as we continue to
speak about our spiritual journey in light of our present national and
global context. The book is ""When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for
Difficult Times"" by Pema Chodron. One of her points is that the very
effort to find a safe and secure place is what causes us so much
suffering. This book will both challenge and comfort you.

   The other resource is to visit a web site where you can find two
talks by Thich Nhat Hanh. One is a sermon he gave at Riverside Church
right after the 9/11 attacks. The other is an interview he gave
entitled ""If I Could Talk With Osama Bin Laden."" You can find all of
this at

http://www.plumvillage.org

   I look forward to seeing you this coming Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an
enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present

"RE: Installation of Pigging Facilities","I agree with using your Special Services assessment. It's not an expansion as there is no increase in certificated capacity. So nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Subject:	Installation of Pigging Facilities

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

"RE:  FYI on Capacity Approvals","Morgan,

	I have to disagree with the ""they were available by phone.""  Being out of the office for ""Team Building"" on the last day of the month is inexcusable.  I tried calling Perry and there was no answer; he said he forgot and left his phone on vibrate.  The Omaha capacity people now carry text pagers that I can email info to; they have really improved their response.  The Houston staff needs these pagers too.  Capacity approval on TW is probably our weakest link in the process.  We really need your help to improve this or drastic action will be needed.  When I called at 3 pm to get a last second deal, I didn't get called back until 3:30 pm.  I was told they could be back in the office to approve the deal around 6 pm.  Well, even though I was here until 7 pm, Reliant wasn't going to be.  Perry said he could do it Saturday, once again, Reliant (or someone who can sign contracts) wasn't.  The TW Marketers, all of them, were also out of the office making EVERYTHING fall onto Contracts.  Why are we the only one's that need to be in the office?  I'm going to give this one more month and then, if everyone isn't working together on this, I'm going to Danny and tell him the Deal Capture team is off of TW since no one appears to give a rats ass (and this is after I've calmed down over the weekend).  Speaking to the Contract Group, this is far from the first time these guys weren't available.

Rick-

Obviously we need to be available at all times.  We cannot guarantee one of those people will be in the office at all times, but we will be available via cell phones or pagers.  Actually, when you guys got hold of me on Friday, I had no problem contacting both Perry and Eric, nor did I have any problem contacting the NNG guys at their off-site last week.  Do be sure when your guys call the office extensions, they listen to (rather than by-passing)  the entire greeting, as contact information may be available on that greeting.

I will be sure that the process is evaluated on this end.

Morgan, 

What's going on?  Earlier this week, the NNG capacity approvers were both out of the office and today, both of the TW capacity approvers are out of the office.  We are trying to get two TW ""rush"" contracts through this afternoon and their unavailability is making it very difficult.

We need you to work on an emergency back up coverage plan for bid-week activity.  At a minimum, your team needs to start carrying pagers.

"RE: Mavrix:  ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE","No magic to the 9%.  We could use any reasonable rate as long as we are conceptually consistent in future situations.  I.e.,  we could use the FERC interest rate here if we were willing to always use it in contract termination situations.  Or, if we use a rate here that is X basis points over some generally accepted benchmark (FERC interest rate? prime?  LIBOR?) we'd have a tough time justifying use of a significantly different mechanism (even though the actual rate in the subsequent deal might be a lot different due to interest rate movement).  df

We should give Maverix the option of paying the discounted sum up front or doing a keep whole payment each month of the transaction.    I like the 9% discount rate for Maverix but would not be happy with such from an outsider.    Is there a basis in the 9% rate?

Subject:	Mavrix:  ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation contracts.  Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue shortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer at the same or better rate within 60 days.  I believe this approach allows TW to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financial risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release them from their contract obligations without penalty.  

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance that a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came from.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that  ""capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons including contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity.""  If the questioning customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, the confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants more detail, is that ""Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business and terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract termination subject to an indemnity or ""keep whole"" mechanism."" 

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow up on this later today.  DF

Eric - I am working with a company called Energy Development Group which is proposing to build power plants along TW's pipeline.  I have spent several telephone sessions with them trying to help them understand exactly where TW's line runs in certain areas of New Mexico and Arizona.  At this point in time I need some assistance from Facility Planning in order to more specifically identify the areas EDG is concerned with.  Would you please let me know who I can work with on this one?

Also, earlier this year, TW constructed a new receipt point in the La Plata station yard for Red Cedar.  Red Cedar paid TW $450,000 for the new point stating that ""If the actual costs of constructing the new interconnect is less than $450,000, Red Cedar shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of the difference between $450,000 and the actual cost.""  Please let me know what the actual cost of the new facilities ended up being.  Thanks.

"TW Capacity Affected for Red Rock Tie-ins","The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result from tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assemblies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubbers will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the station yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjacent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line will produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respective horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

"FW: TW Waste Heat Recovery Projects","Last but not least, the lenghty story below is what I have been talking about with regards to the GE's versus the electrics on San Juan in conjunction with Sun Devil.  I'm afraid I've done a poor job at explaining my reasoning so, I put it on paper as best I could.  I hope this helps clear the issue up or at least provides enough information to allow you all to understand the concept... thanks  As usual this is pretty far fetched....

Subject:	FW: TW Waste Heat Recovery Projects

Sorry to be late with a response back but, I wanted to run a few things down before getting back with you and explaining why I was really so interested in this project.  After visiting with you in the field this week you asked that I jot some of this down so this will be an attempt at my reasoning and why I have such a sense of urgency about tie-ing this potential project into a Sun Devil deal.  Here goes nothing:

As I understand it, the current senario for Sun Devil as it relates to the San Juan section of this project includes:
The addition of 15,000 hp at Bloomfield
A compressor restage at Bisti
A new 15,000 hp station at Standing Rock
A larger compressor at Gallup
Potentially a larger motor at Gallup

A suggested change to this plan was to look at the 41,000 hp GE's at Bloomfield and Standing Rock allowing us to stand-down the Electrics on the San Juan Lateral.  The capital cost would increase by approximately $30 M but the capacity increase on the lateral would be around 80 mmcfd.  (These are not by any means firm numbers)  

The problem with the suggestion obviously is the term of the contracts with ECS on the Electric drives.  So, this is what I was thinking.  I know we don't want to leave ECS holding the bag or stranding cost so, if the HRSG were to move forward at Station 1, maybe we could allow them to wheel the commodity (the fuel gas) out there.  We provide them with gas in trade for electricity currently.  If we stand down the electrics, ECS would save dollars paid now to the utilities but, they would loose large bucks from the sale of natural gas that we provide them for the power.  So, we could allow them to keep the gas for the remaining term of the contracts and sell it to Gadd's group on the HRSG project.  Depending on the current margins, they may be able to help Gadd's group cut some expense's as well and keep this project rolling???   (Motive is to get this HRSG going so Operations can generate some operating revenue off of this facility)   See the example below to follow along with this idea:

ECS currently pays approximately $3,133,280 annually in electricity to provide TW shaft horse power
TW provides ECS with a commodity valued at $8,000,070 annually.  (At $2.50 per thousand)
The difference is $4,866,790
TW pays ECS a demand charge of $2,794,000 between Bisti and Bloomfield.

The $3,133,280 would be an expense ECS would no longer be required to have if the Electrics were shut down.  So, ECS should be able to allow TW out of the $2,794,00 in annual demand charges for Bloomfield and Bisti and return the $3 M in commodity value to TW.  Now there is still the issue of the $8,000,070 in commodity value minus the $3,133,280 returned to TW.  We can keep ECS whole on this value ($4,866,790) by transfering the fuel sale to the HRSG at Station 1 allowing them to simply sell the fuel there or market it accordingly for the term of the current contract.  As long as we keep ECS whole on the value of this deal, in turn ECS should be able to negotiate a deal at reduced rates to allow the HRSG project economics to become more appealing...  At least that was my idea.  Pretty crazy huh?  

None the less for an increase of 80 mmcfd on Sun Devil, the potential revenue from an operating agreement on the HRSG through EAMR, and the reduced exposure due to down time associated with the electric failures as compared to what GE is required to provide....... I thought it was worth a shot.  If you think this is too far fetched....just say so Norm..  Not carrying anything on my shoulder here.  Have a good day and sorry this dang note was so long...  

Oh yea, I would have thrown Gallups numbers into this mix as well but, those agreements are so complicated I have a hard time understanding and/or relaying information about them...   However, understand, when I say stand the electrics down on the San Juan lateral that includes, Bloomfield, Bisti and Gallup.....  R. Matthews ran the modeling info and that is who I have been chatting with about this thought.

Like in school:  I thought I would show you my work...
Bisit currently has a conversion factor of .0198 that multiplys into horse power to determine how much fuel gas we owe them for shaft power.  They also have a contract with PNM that determines the rate ECS pays per Mega Watt for the power they provide TW.   (I will use $2.50 for the price of gas in examples)  ECS pays approximately $25 per meg for power at Bisti.

10,000 hp x .0198 x $2.50 = $495 per hour
$495 / (10,000 x .7546) = $.0663 per kw 
10,000 x .0198 x 8760 x $2.50 = $4,336,200 annually in fuel provided to ECS

(10,000 x .7546) / 1000 x $25 = $188.65 per hour in electric cost
$188.65 x 8760 = $1,652,574  annually in electric cost

Bloomfield currently has a conversion factor of .0239.  Power rate I think is more in the range of $32 dollars a meg.

7000 hp x .0198 x $2.50 = $418 per hour
$418 / (7000 x .7546) = .08 per kw 
7000 x .0239 x 8760 x $2.50 = $3,663,870 annually in fuel provided to ECS

(7000 x .7546) / 1000 x $32 = $169.03 per hour in electric cost
$169.03 x 8760 = $1,480,706 annually in electric cost

Ok, enough of all that.  The bottom line expenses are as follows:
Bisti fuel commodity cost - $4,336,200
Bisti electricity cost - $1,652,574
Bisti demand fee paid to ECS - $2,017,000
Bloomfield fuel commodity cost - $3,663,870
Bloomfield electricity cost - $1,480,706
Bloomfield demand fee paid to ECS - $777,000

Norm, 

We've been trying to develop a project at Station 1 due to its close proximity to the Round Valley substation.  Although we've considered several designs ranging from a 15MW steam cycle to a 60MW plant with an LM6000, the required power price is always about $45/MWh, which is out of the market.  Our current objective is to find a counter-party who is willing to build a plant and purchase waste heat, land, water, shared facilities, and operating services from TW.  A few parties are interested and we're pressing on.  

I would be happy to meet with you and your team to share ideas and answer questions.

  9:00 CST, Friday, 8/31

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

"NGI Article on TW Ruling","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 29, 2001
ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff ""so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption"" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was ""a tortuous process."" 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While ""both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,"" the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.  The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. ""Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power."" 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the ""index-to-index"" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate ""to minimize any risk on transportation options."" The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.

"FWD: Great Gourmands","FYI...

>===== Original Message From HThurlow@aol.com =====
Hello.
       It's time again to take a 'head count' and be clear just who is coming
to dinner on Nov. 2.  We looked into the Haak winery and that's not an option
afterall, so Jim and I are holding the dinner at home.  We thought that
6:00pm might be better too.  So, we'd like to know for sure if you are
coming, so we can assign you a dish.  Please let us know ASAP if you will be
coming, and you'll receive a recipe.  Also, if you have a preference for a
course, please let me know.
       We're looking forward to having the Great Gourmands here in our home.
The theme is Creole and we've got a great selection of recipes from the
favorite restaurants in New Orleans.  So, let me know.
       We're looking forward to seeing you in November!
Be well,  Hattie & Jim

The last time I spoke with anyone at NP was about 2 yrs. ago.  John Olenick was against any more FT because of the impending dereg.  To my knowledge, no one at Las Vegas Cogen has been approached directly.

Steve - In response to your previous questions regarding customers behind SWG.  SWG's largest customers are power plants.

	Nevada Power (still owns generation)
	El Dorado (Reliant and Sempra)
	Nevada Cogen Assoc. (NCA1 & 2) (partially owned by Texaco)
	Saguro Power Plant (NRG partially owns)
	Las Vegas Cogen (Enron involved?)
	
Parties who are either planning to build new power plants or are already building power plants in the Southern Nevada area include
Mirant
Reliant
Calpine
PG&E

APS/Pinnacle West was among the buyers of one of Nevada Power's plants before dereg in NV was postponed.

Please let me know if you need other info.

Subject: Missing Document from Questar Data Room


I got a call from Questar's Jodi Starling this morning.  She said an original document is missig from the data room and was wondering if someone brought it home by mistake.

The missing information is the Dandby section from the Asset Binder.  It had a grey card-stock cover.  We can certainly keep a copy but they need the original back.  With all of the paper floating around the tables, it is likely to have been mixed up with some copies that were given to us.  Anyway, please check your stuff and see if this got in there.

Also, the late copies she was making for us (including the stuff from Colleen) will be mailed overnight to Kim on Friday.  We'll get the information passed out when we get it.

Thanks,

Mark

"Checking in...","Mike & Cheryl -

We heard yesterday about Cheryl's illness.  You guys have been such special
friends to us, we both wanted to know if there was anything we could do to
help.

If Cheryl is going to be going down to MD Anderson for treatment, either on
an outpatient or inpatient basis, consider this:  our house is less than a
ten-minute walk from MD Anderson.  We have a spare bedroom and free parking.
If it works out that Mike drops Cheryl off and needs a place to stay, either
overnight or periodically during the day, we'll leave a key at the front
desk of the Spires and one (or both) of you can base out of our place.

And if you need someone to take care of the menagerie up north, I'm sure we
can figure out how to get that done while you're staying down south.
Remember that I make the reverse commute up there every day, and you both
have a lot of friends and co-workers that can pitch in to help out.

We think the world of you guys and want to help.  Let us know how we can.

Kim & John

"RE: Gray Interconnect","Thanks for the note....remember that on NNG, Gray is an exempt point (fuel to the Permian Mids 1-7 is only 1.06 %, and the commodity is only about a penny more than from Halley).  This should have pretty good value for the summer (value similar to your West Texas lateral).  In the winter, the rate to demarc is 2.66% + 1.5 cent commodity on NNG if you want some pricing points.

Jo, I actually mentioned this in our TW staff meeting with Steve yesterday about using the OBA's to balance this point for November service if the interconnect was not ready.  We could carve out a few minutes after one of the morning meetings to discuss this with Market Services - both TW and NNG representatives to work out the details for their shop.  FYI, Michelle is working with Burlington to deliver gas to NNG@Gray on their firm contract as well as discussions with Oneok to deliver gas to TW@Gray.  

Thanks, Kim.

fyi.  I had requested Earl to provide an update on this interconnect.  If we have actual flows scheduled (and we know we have 25,000 of firm contracted) before the 12/1 date, we might have to do something at Halley to balance flows.  Should we start working out the details of that?

Jo

R-O-W has gave 30 day notice to adjacent landowners
Survey has been completed for pipeline
SHPO & F&F survey being completed on pipeline route
Valves has been quoted for a 8 -12 week delivery, unacceptable. Have requested buyer purchase Grove Valves with a 4 week delivery.
Should know on pipe this week for delivery and cost.
The existing Gray county I/C will be relocated to P-3 as a complete unit
An 8"" meter tube and two 12"" valves have been located from surplus for installing at the original I/C with dry flow measurement
Installation will be T&M to reduce time frame for bid package and drawings and allow quicker contractor move in and start up.

The target date is 11-1-01, but with the delay, 2 1/2 months, in approving the P.A., as stated in the original cost estimates, E&C required a June approval to meet the in service date of 11-1-01, we have a forecast ready for service date of 12-01-01. We will expedite materials and installation in an attempt to meet the target date.
If any questions, lease let me know

Earl

Earl,

I haven't heard anything lately on the status of the Gray Interconnect.  Has the cost estimate remained the same?  What is the schedule for in-service?

Let me know.

"New Mexico Power Plant Project","Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

The I/C is a 10"" UltraSonic designed for a range of 35 mmcfd to +100 mmcfd. 
By using the US meter, this allows a wide range of volumes without changing out the tube when Agave want to increase the volumes.

I/C to include
US meter
H2S
H2O 
Chromatograph
Flow control
Positive Shut in
EFM
DAS
UPS
Building
GFC
Material cost = $210,000

Install cost (contractor, inspection, Dlab, Eng, Proj. man) = $130,000

Contingency = $ 50,000

OH, AFUDC, = $ 19,000

Total of I/C = $399,000
Total of tap = $75,000

Total installed cost = $474,000

This is a Level ""A"" cost and to target the equipment needed and bring the cost into a Level ""B"" will required a defined scope with Agave. THE TIME REQUIRED FOR A PROJECT TO BE IN SERVICE IS 90 DAYS FROM THE APPROVED WORK ORDER.

As of 11/11/01 SoCal's oba is a receivable of 358,416 mmbtus.  I know that we do not control the Needles point; however ????

SoCal's oba remains volumetric and a drop in index prices would cause a large dollar hit.

Paul,

I reviewed the data in the CBS system as well as the contract folders in order to respond to your questions.  Here are my findings:
Information regarding delivery point volumes provided by TK are correct.  
The requests for realignment on both contracts were effective 4/1/01 through the remaining term of the contracts.
There is a copy of the executed amendments in the respective contract folders and/or in Envision (K 25841 - amendment #66, K 26511 - amendment #34)
K 25841 has no language prohibiting PG&E ET-GC to realign during the term of the agreement
K 26511 does have language in a discount letter agreement dated 5/27/99 stating ""Shipper shall have a one time option during the term of the discount agreement while retaining the discounted rate to change primary delivery point capacity to PG&E Topock, subject to the availability of capacity at such point.""

If you have any questions, please let me know.  I'll give you a call with this information as well.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Elizabeth,

The original delivery points for these contracts were:

25841		40,000/d to Topock

26511		21,000/d to Needles


TK tells me that now the delivery points are:

25841		29,000/d to Topock
		11,000/d to Needles

26511		11,000/d to Topock
		10,000/d to Needles

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

I will be out for the rest of the week. Please call me at 713 825-8046 when you figure this out.

Many Thanks,

Paul

They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

"Allocations to ETS","Vince,

According to the attached schedule, we should begin allocating costs in July to the ETS Revenue Management group for Capital Project Work.  In addition, no allocations have been made in 2001 to Dan McCarty's group.  Have any agreements been reached as to the amount of these allocations and where they will be charged?  

Also, no allocations have been made for John Goodpasture's group, pending the creation of a new cost center.  Kim, can you tell me where this should be charged yet?

Thanks,

Ben takes care of the RTU configurations for TW so I think Citizens was wanting to pick his brain or ask for assistance.  Both turbines at Griffith are now online as you probably know.....

Ugh! You were right, I removed it from below.  
I spoke at length with Russ on Friday and I also spoke with Laura Kunkel.  Laura indicated that the gains were adjusted in RTUs last week by Citizens/Griffith personnel which cased the shutdown.  There seems to be some other RTU programming issues that need to be addressed that Laura has mentioned.  They (Trigon-Sheehan) are considering a third party to write/recommend a new RTU file to operate controls.  Stay tuned, more to come.  EF

Hi Girls!

I'm visiting Janell and Dennis this weekend. She still has a gimpy leg and 
can't make it upstairs to their computer.  She asked me to send some info on 
Girls's Weekend.  Unfortunately, she is doubtful that she will make it this 
time.

Here's the scoop:
-  Girls' Weekend is still on for November 30 - December 2 at Lisa's inlaws' 
place on the Bolivar Pennisula. Lisa will be sending directions and a phone 
#.
-  If you are receiving this e-mail we are assuming you are coming
-  Janell is requiring Christmas pictures - Kim please bring your camera.
_  Judy please bring your aerobed - just in case we need it - with sheets 
and a blanket.
-  Bring a deck chair.
-  Food assignments will be coming - Lisa I volunteered us to come up with 
them.
-  Friday night you are on your own for dinner.
-  In case its cold, you may want to bring a blanket.

Janell says hi - she is waving her crutch -  and is looking forward to the 
next gathering.

See you soon!
Cynthia

"RE: Big Sandy Delivery Point Construction and Operating Agreement - Revised","Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect agreement,
etc.

"Transpecos","Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

The work is completed and the project is closed.  The figures that I saw indicated that the project was under budget where Red Cedar might be receiving some change.  I think after a job has been closed and 180 days has passed then Property Accounting is the group responsible for handling the invoicing business that you are inquiring about.  Check with Kim Watson in this regard, she is currently working with some claim issues concerning the Calpine interconnect.  Perhaps she can direct you with the process.

What's your schedule on the EDG business?  I would recommend Ron, at this point.  EF  

I have figures on the second part that needs to verified by Earl Chanley to be certain all costs have been submitted.  Earl has been on vacation last week and returned yesterday.  I am sure he has been getting caught up and I await his reply.

Eric - I am working with a company called Energy Development Group which is proposing to build power plants along TW's pipeline.  I have spent several telephone sessions with them trying to help them understand exactly where TW's line runs in certain areas of New Mexico and Arizona.  At this point in time I need some assistance from Facility Planning in order to more specifically identify the areas EDG is concerned with.  Would you please let me know who I can work with on this one?

Also, earlier this year, TW constructed a new receipt point in the La Plata station yard for Red Cedar.  Red Cedar paid TW $450,000 for the new point stating that ""If the actual costs of constructing the new interconnect is less than $450,000, Red Cedar shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of the difference between $450,000 and the actual cost.""  Please let me know what the actual cost of the new facilities ended up being.  Thanks.

  Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required,  In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01.  Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding.  In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process.  If this isn't clear, please call    MK

Subject:	Quick update on El Paso capacity allocation conference

Today's technical conference (RP00-336) was not the snazzy show we perhaps expected.  With El Paso having done 5 studies on different allocation scenarios, shippers requested four more, showing seasonalization impacts and the difference between CD and Full Requirements shipper Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks.  

Though there were some FR vs. CD shippers discussions, they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by 
the TX, NM and AZ FR shippers and Aera Energy (CD shippers).  There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service.

The primary issue here ended up being procedural, with the decision still up in the air if this should be set for hearing or a merits decision from the Commission (or settlement, though that seems very likely -- merits decision is the most likely case).

Also never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants proposals that El Paso dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or requiring mainline system expansion for existing service (RP01-484 and 486).

The procedural schedule has been set:
	El paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing:   Sept. 24
	Initial comments (on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations): Oct. 15

"FERC conference on El Paso capacity allocation (RP00-336)","Summary

Though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to El Paso's capacity allocation method (including those in the pipeline's Order 637 proceeding), and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline's allocation, major substantive issues were not covered at this conference.  For instance, the battle between Full Requirements (FR) shippers and Contract Demand (CD) shippers came up marginally, but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of FR shippers to CD contracts.

Procedurally, there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing, merits decision from the Commission or settlement, though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision.  Staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions.

Allocation Studies (Models)

El Paso opened the conference with a presentation/interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal (March 27) would allocate the system's receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios.  For nominations, receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers, and the model used 20 pools.  The scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred (based on those shipper-supplied preferences), solved the largest constraints first, then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation.

There were questions on the studies, what they show, what the assumptions are, etc., and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies.  Shippers have requested six more allocation studies, showing possible impacts of seasonalization (winter and summer) and the difference between CD and Full Requirements Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks (winter and summer, 1995 - 2000).  

El Paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable, and in fact results in 247 MMcf/d of unallocated capacity (230 MMcf coming from the Line 2000 expansion proposal, and an extra 17 MMcf).  Shippers were skeptical of the ""slack capacity"" finding.

Other Issues

?	Pooling: There was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to 20 pools.  It was noted that this should be addressed with Order 637 issues, expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved.

?	FR vs. CD: Though there were some FR vs. CD shippers discussions, they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the TX, NM and AZ shippers (FR) and Aera Energy (CD shippers).  There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service.  Note: never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants' proposals that El Paso (1) dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or (2) requiring mainline system expansion for existing service (RP01-484 and 486).

?	Release shippers:  Shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated, as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline (which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated).

?	Receipt Point Designation:  The question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools.  When asked what Commission policy is on pools vs. receipt points, both shippers and Staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another - both should be available.  However, Staff noted that in the flexibility vs. reliability debate, it could be argued that El Paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability.


Procedure Going Forward

The primary issue here ended up being procedural.

The procedural schedule is as follows:
?	El Paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing:   Sept. 24
?	Initial comments (on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations): Oct. 15
?	Reply comments:  Oct. 26

"","I didn't realize the report that I sent out yesterday about the California Energy Commission's conclusions on the state's natural gas infrastructure was so long!  Here is a brief synopsis.  I hope this helps everyone.  I haven't had time to read the full report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it to you as well.

CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices 
Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit. 
It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. ""Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California,"" the report stated. 
Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more ""independent"" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully ""optimize"" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users. 
As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet ""growing demand in California and throughout the West."" If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be. 
For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are ""key indicators"" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure. 
The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new ""design criteria and reliability standards"" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls ""the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;"" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a ""natural gas curtailment scheme"" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages. 
The 111-page report, ""Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues,"" prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border. 
As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is ""fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas"" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage.

The work is completed and the project is closed.  The figures that I saw indicated that the project was under budget where Red Cedar might be receiving some change.  I think after a job has been closed and 180 days has passed then Property Accounting is the group responsible for handling the invoicing business that you are inquiring about.  Check with Kim Watson in this regard, she is currently working with some claim issues concerning the Calpine interconnect.  Perhaps she can direct you with the process.

Eric - I am working with a company called Energy Development Group which is proposing to build power plants along TW's pipeline.  I have spent several telephone sessions with them trying to help them understand exactly where TW's line runs in certain areas of New Mexico and Arizona.  At this point in time I need some assistance from Facility Planning in order to more specifically identify the areas EDG is concerned with.  Would you please let me know who I can work with on this one?

Also, earlier this year, TW constructed a new receipt point in the La Plata station yard for Red Cedar.  Red Cedar paid TW $450,000 for the new point stating that ""If the actual costs of constructing the new interconnect is less than $450,000, Red Cedar shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of the difference between $450,000 and the actual cost.""  Please let me know what the actual cost of the new facilities ended up being.  Thanks.

"USGT K# 27161","
	Here's what I've found out from Dennis Lee.  USGT requested a realignment of delivery capacity back in June (it was also sent to them in June).  They held onto the request until a few weeks ago when they signed and returned the amendment.  Dennis found where the capacity was disapproved by Perry Frazier but, for an as yet unknown reason, Michelle Cormier tendered this amendment to them.  The changes have been activated in the TW contract system; however, we have not signed/returned the amendment and they have not nominated these changes.  Dennis says they switch these DP's frequently and would ""probably"" be agreeable to switch 6,000/d of their capacity (which was suggested by Perry in his denial of capacity) upon our request.  As you're aware, Michelle has changed jobs since this incident and this amendment was tendered prior to our re-implemention of the routing process.  I'll get you the file and associated papers as soon as Dennis has completed his examination. Our Tariff does stipulate that an amendment, not returned within 30 days, is null and void.  Since we did not sign and return the amendment, we could just say it ""timed out""...  just a thought.

"You know, I've been wondering....","Hi,

I know everyone is doing their best, and it is appreciated, but:

How can The Association continue to justify asking residents to pay the same
fees month after month after month while simultaneously failing month after
month after month to provide all the services we pay for?

I'm curious: has the board has addressed the possibility of reducing fees
commensurate with services provided?  If they did and (obviously) decided to
keep things the same, I'd appreciate a glimpse into the ""why"" of that
decision.

Just wondering aloud after another one-elevator-day.

I would greatly appreciate an official response from the board by email.

Thank you very much for time,

Mike Mancini

(of course, I am well aware we received a month free, which works pretty
well considering the building was unlivable most of that month.  I am aware,
too, of water damage checks for, yes, damage.  I'm not aware of anything in
the works, however, to reasonably address the last many months of poor
service, nor the predicted next 6-12 months of the same...  I most certainly
welcome enlightenment if I am missing something simple---really!)

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"FW: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR","As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

"Kinder Morgan Makes Some Expansion Announcements for Rockies","Pipe Expansions Planned for Rockies Region 
With several pipeline companies well into addressing the pipeline capacity shortages that persist as natural gas production grows throughout the Rocky Mountain region, Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC (KMIGT) announced two major projects Wednesday, and several other companies detailed expansions planned or in the works during the closing session at the 13th Annual Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Strategy Conference. 
Headlining the news was KMIGT's plans to use existing rights-of-way to build the Advantage Pipeline, which would fill the same needs as the Colorado Interstate Gas pipe, moving from the Cheyenne Hub to the Mid-Continent. An open season is scheduled on the proposed pipe this fall. 
Dave Scharf, business development director for KMIGT, said the 24-inch pipe, which would move gas primarily from the Powder River Basin, would have a capacity of 330 MMcf/d, delivering to interconnects on its way to the Kansas City markets. 
""It would have a smaller size, with about 40% less content,"" Scharf said, but it would be expandable to 450 MMcf/d, with access to liquid Mid-Continent pipes, local distribution centers and end-use markets. 
A smaller pipeline, NECO -- a 12-inch pipe, about 95 miles long -- would serve the northeastern Colorado market. Although small, Scharf emphasized that it would reduce some of the bottlenecks now evident in moving gas in that part of the state, and would also allow backhauls to Cheyenne. An open season on this line is also scheduled this fall, Scharf said. 
KMIGT also is planning to expand its storage capacity in the Rockies, adding more horsepower at the Cheyenne Hub and Huntsman facility. The Huntsman would be expanded to deliver 75 MMcf/d, with delivery at Cheyenne of 45 MMcf/d. 
""We want to customize shippers' needs,"" Scharf said of the expansion. Noting there were synergies between the three projects, he said KMIGT was on a growth plan that would use both acquisitions and expansion. ""Rocky Mountain growth opportunities we see are in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska,"" he said. 
El Paso's Craig Coombs, who directs project development for the company's Western Pipeline Group, said El Paso also is expanding its pipelines east from the Rockies, with a Cheyenne to Mid-Continent connection, spending $380 million to add 540 MDth/d. The open season for this expansion ended July 20, said Coombs, and he said El Paso is now negotiating with shippers. A FERC filing is scheduled for December 2001, with an in-service date in late 2003 or early 2004. 
Coombs also updated attendees on the CIG expansion along the Front Range of the Rockies, which he said is on track to be in service by mid-2004. Over the next four years, Coombs said supply from the Rockies would grow from 5 Bcf/d to 7.5 Bcf/d, and warned there would be ""blood on the streets"" if pipeline systems are not expanded. 
Coombs said El Paso planned to file its request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January 2002 for its Ruby pipeline, which is scheduled to carry 250 MDth/d from the Rockies into Nevada and 500 MDth/d into California. The Ruby project, said Coombs, ""is designed with power plants in mind."" The pipeline will be 30-36-inches with 40,000 horsepower. 
El Paso's Western Frontier pipeline project, which also closed its open season in July, is also is on schedule, with a FERC filing by the fourth quarter of this year and an in-service target date by November 2003. 
""What's driving all of these expansions are the power plant projects,"" Coombs said. With more than 9,200 MW proposed in the region in the coming years, he said capacity would rise more than 2 Bcf/d by 2010. Noting that every planned expansion might not come to fruition because of competing proposals, Coombs said that there is ""still tremendous growth"" in the Rockies. 
Shelley Wright, supervisor of capacity marketing for Questar Pipeline Co., detailed the many projects her company has under way in the Rockies, including its Main Line 104, the Clay Basin Projects, the Southern Trails pipe to California and its work on the Eakin compressors. 
The Main Line 104, a joint venture with El Paso's CIG, will move new and existing gas supplies to the Wasatch Front and other connecting pipes. It is expected to be in service in November 2001, and is on schedule and moving forward, Wright said. She also noted that the Clay Basin, which is the largest storage facility in the western United States, was already ahead of schedule for 2001-2002 storage. 
""We're seeing more interest in getting storage filled this year"" than last, Wright said, noting that storage was depleted last winter. The Clay Basin facility will undergo testing tentatively in April 2002, which ""may result in additional firm capacity."" Wright said there had been ""a lot of interest in additional storage capacity,"" and Questar will know more next year as to whether it will expand the facility.

Seven pre-addressed return envelopes for the completed questionnaires.

Further information will be sent periodically.

****************************************************************************************************************************************
August 27, 2001

Dear Participant:

It is our pleasure to welcome you to the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program on October 31 - November 2 at the Doubletree - Travis 1&2 .  The program is designed to help leaders develop the skills necessary to manage direct reports.  The program focuses on participative management skills and has leaders and their reports working together to shape goals, standards, and operating procedures, that I believe you will find both relevant and enjoyable.

Program Details

The program will begin at 8:30 a.m. each day and end at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the first 2 days and at 3:00 p.m. on the third day.  Dress is informal.

Because of the full program schedule, there will be no time for regular business contacts.  Therefore, we ask that you clear your calendar for the 3 days and make arrangements for someone to cover your phone calls.

Preparation Materials

Enclosed is the Preparation Materials booklet that you should read over and bring to the program.

Distributing the Enclosed Questionnaires

As part of your preparation for the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program, you will also be distributing the enclosed questionnaires to your direct reports.  Many leaders spend a lot of time trying to figure out what their direct reports are thinking.  To help answer that question, one of the key components of this program is a confidential survey of your direct report's perceptions of your management skill.  The survey will help you to identify your strengths and determine areas in need of improvement.  You are the only person who will see the survey results, unless you decide to share them.

Distribute one of the enclosed questionnaires to each of the seven direct reports that you have selected.  You may wish to hand deliver each questionnaire so that you can personally explain its purpose.  In doing so you should emphasize that:

The reason you are asking him or her to fill out the questionnaire is to improve the quality of communication and effectiveness of work that transpires between you.

His or her responses are strictly confidential. (The survey report that you will see at the program will be the combined results of all your direct reports.)

The completed questionnaire must be received by the Forum Corporation for scoring no later than October 24th. Please allow 2 weeks for the questionnaire to travel through postal system.

The questionnaire instructions explain that the direct report must fill in the level he or she feels is required in each dimension and the level he or she feel you have attained.

I am confident that your direct reports will be happy to oblige.  The questionnaire should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Please note that a feedback report can only be generated for you when you use the questionnaire that I have assigned to you.  Should you or your direct reports misplace a questionnaire do not use a colleague's ""extras"" or photocopy questionnaires.  The questionnaires that have been assigned to you have a unique coding number which has been assigned specifically for you in order to create a custom feedback report.  The questionnaires assigned to you cannot be duplicated or modified in any valid way without my knowledge.  If you need replacement questionnaires for any reason, please see me and I will provide you with any extra questionnaires you may require.

I look forward to your participation in the program and know you will find it to be an interesting and rewarding experience.  If any questions remain unanswered, give me a call.

Sincerely,


Tom Wilbeck

Print this attachment out and take it with you, since it has the

$189.00 per night, including breakfast.

This probably isn't in the downtown area, since it is supposedly a golf 
resort.  Paul said he would find out the exact location for us.
If you are able to locate something better, feel free.  I could find several 
hotels on Travelocity that had availability, but the phone # wasn't provided 
and you can only book one room at a time.

The cancellation policy on this hotel is good -- we just have to cancel by 
6pm Sept 29 -- so we can easily switch hotels.

Talk to you later,

"Re: Replacement of J Bolton","Jim talked to me about his resignation again on Friday. He indicated that he 
wished for his replacement to be chosen before he resigns. I think he really 
thought he is helping the board by doing it this way. I told him that I did 
not believe that it was appropriate to ""arrange"" things. I also told him that 
he can remain on the board for as long as he lives in his unit. And the board 
will replace him by seeking the best person to fill his seat for the 
remainder of his term when he resigns. He indicated that in the past the next 
person getting the highest number of votes would be selected. I informed him 
that while this had happened in the past, but the board is not obligated to 
do it in this manner. 

We should ask anyone who is interested to fill this seat to submit his/her 
name to be considered by the board.

"FW: New Generation Report for July 2001","Kim,
Here is the WSCC report from ENA on status of new generation facilities.
The status on EAMR is that I am in the process of finalizing the writeup on power plant services that I promised you a copy of.
We have been working very closely with John Dushinske's group on 3 new projects off of NNG where EAMR would potentially build or provide services for new laterals to new power plants.  The projects are Lincoln Electric System (6.5 miles), Omaha Public Power (<1 mile) and Mid American (12 miles).
On LES, the customer went out with an RFP for the design, ROW and construction management only.  On OPP, Chuck Wilkinson is his proposal to the customer gave 3 options: 1) NNG builds and owns with customer paying overheads and tax gross up, 2) NNG rolls project into rates (cost still includes overheads but no tax gross up) and 3) customer owns and EAMR builds and possibly operates facility.  The proposal for OPP is similar to MidAm. 
We have found that options 1) and 2) are fast and easy because Level A cost estimates can be used, however, for option 3, a much more detailed bid is required which is sort of like a Level B+ estimate, which is more detailed than normal Level B estimates.  We are working through the process and various issues for option 3.  To get definitive bids for option 3, a 30 to 45 day lead time is required.
This ground work for NNG will come in handy on TW projects.

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

Questar Can't Sell from Proposed Pipeline Under New CA Rate 
Although not giving up its search for customers in California, Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp.'s oil-to-natural-gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners of New Mexico remains stymied in operating its portion within California under a newly revised ""peaking tariff"" for Southern California Gas Co., according to Questar officials who have been analyzing the new rate established Aug. 2 by state regulators.  Questar is looking at alternative uses for the California portion of the approved interstate pipeline. 
""We can't work with (the rate) as it is,"" said Chad Jones, a Questar spokesperson. ""It definitely doesn't go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in Southern California. It still doesn't level the playing field. Although it is better than the current RLS (residual load service) tariff; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCalGas competitor. 
""Customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state, and higher rates for balancing services. We're at the point where we're not going to stop trying to market capacity on Southern Trails, but we're definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the California portion (of the 700-miles, 16-inch-diameter pipeline)."" 
One of the alternatives would be to operate the California part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the Long Beach Harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the California-Arizona border. That's the alternative, however, Jones said, but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline's 120 MMcf/d capacity is still Questar's preference. 
After months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives, the California Public Utilities Commission last week established a new ""peaking"" or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a SoCalGas competitor, allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility, SoCalGas. 
The CPUC tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers, while trying to ""encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry-picking or overbuilding,"" according to CPUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Questar officials said Tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources, and they are ""not about to go head-to-head with the established big boys"" in lobbying California's governor or state legislature, Jones said. ""Thus, we're still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in Southern California in the name of promoting competition."" 
The east-of-California portion of the Southern Trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid-year next year, Jones said.

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

"FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes","            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

"NGI Article on TW Hearing (After First Day)","Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals 
A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. 
Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered ""moot"" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. 
""Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before"" capacity became available, ""it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted"" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were ""null and void."" The only ""relevant"" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. 
Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. 
It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. 
Richardson and Sempra ""clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted,"" Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies ""had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra,"" she noted. 
Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, ""Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates,"" Miller testified. 
Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates.  In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more ""willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available."" But Miller counters that Sullivan ""offers not support for his claim."" 
She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data request by Southern California Edison, support Transwestern's claims. Both companies replied ""no"" when asked whether ""any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate."" 
The ""capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictions, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, including Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate."" 
Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit. Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller conceded that Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1.3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a ""comparable"" amount from Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a ""substantially higher"" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract, but she didn't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million. 
Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commission's negotiated-rate policy ""does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits."" 
Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan has suggested. This case ""is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged.""

"RE: CEC Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues 052901","Thanks for thinking of sending this to me as I always appreciate any California regulatory data.  This report came out in May and is known as the CEC's ""White Paper"" on the CA Natural Gas Infrastructure.  After Com. Woods appointment at FERC, the CEC made sure he was aware of their paper and forwarded it to FERC.  The primary thrust of the paper is in line with our position that SoCal and PG&E need to expand their take-away capacity at the border.  Interestingly the FERC issued a similar finding after the Technical Conference on the same subject was held in Wash. DC.
I don't expect the CEC to do much of anything with the paper beyond the press they got for identifying one of the causes for the price spike and a shortage of gas into the state.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  gh

2.	SoCal to turnback 20,000 to 25,000/d of receipt capacity from the WTX Pool, at no cost to TW (SoCal continues to pay for it).

3.	TW has been scheduling PG&E's payback to SoCal at SoCal/Topock to help PG&E and SoCal.  SoCal to schedule this as transport from PG&E/Topock (as a RP) to SoCal/Topock (DP) and pay TW transport fee.

4.	SoCal to agree (in writing) to dedicate to TW the incremental 50,000/d at Needles becoming available Jan, 2002 until Red Rock Expansion in-service.

5.	SoCal to amend their OBA to dollar-valued (from volumetric) and cash-out their existing OBA with TW (at TW's index value).

6.	SoCal to sell storage to TW.

7.	SoCal to purchase incremental Thoreau to West of Thoreau capacity from TW.

8.	Extension of SoCal's mainline &/or San Juan lateral contracts.  Or early notice of termination or early notice of ROFR trigger (so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it).

Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated flow I was showing on the outage report was 130 mmcfd, (per Eric Faucheaux Planning) and the actual affect is 180 mmcfd.

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/01 to 12/01/01) Darrell is going to post something on it today.

I also had a WT2 outage on the report that the field was asking for. It showed a complete Station shut down for 24 hours. Darrell and I talked the field into moving it to next year. (Early March) If you have any questions let me know.

"Installation of Pigging Facilities","I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

"Financing Arrangements","Kim:
I was hoping to catch up with you after Stan's meeting to discuss TW financing arrangements.  Their is still a very good possibility that TW could be added to the Cpt. 11 companies sometime in early Jan. (the Revolving Credit Agreement would be paid off as part of that process).  Two things to remember on new projects - (i) likelihood of TW cash for equity in deal is very low and (ii) If TW is put into Cpt. 11, the implications of its credit on the other counterparties.  If we can find other people's money and structure around the TW credit risk, we have a better chance (but still will be extremely tough).  As you heard this morning, cash is at a very high premium right now (especially with Red Rock expansion).

Thanks,

Kevin

"Re: Replacement of J Bolton","Kim,
I agree with the three people on the list as those we should consider.

Carolyn Brown has had interest in the Board, but she is seldom on the same
page as other people commonly are, and when she was on the board when Ken
chaired it, almost everyone pulled their hair out after being in meetings
with her.

Houshyar talked with Ken about his interest in being on the board, and both
Houshyar and I told Ken that it is not a problem for both of us to be on the
board at the same time.

More later as thought come to me.

"FW: Agenda for TW Meeting:  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL, ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE","Stan, Rod and Danny:  following is an outline of the issues I'd like to cover tomorrow.  The last point is the most important, so we can blow through the preliminaries as fast (or slow) as is appropriate.  

 
1.  Current Status of Proceeding
	--Briefing is complete
	--minor skirmishing on page limit and Staff motion to strike still going on (argument set for 9-28) 
 	--ALJ decision still expected on or around 10-15

2.  Primary Issues
	--TW's tariff and posting procedures are confusing, complex, inconsistent, and allow TW too much discretion
	--TW gave Sempra and Richardson unfair advance notice of the capacity availability (preposting conversations) 
	--TW withheld operational capacity and agreed to make it available only to shippers who agreed to favorable deals with TW
	--TW offered negotiated terms and conditions in exchange for the shippers' agreement to pay high rates  
	--The Sempra and Richardson deals are irrational and must have been the product of market power or unfairness

3.  The Political Climate
	--FERC is now coming after PG&E GT NW, on facts that look worse than ours (customers claim they weren't offered the recourse rate).   That case is set for hearing with a decision within 120 days.  Staff raised one new issue:  misuse of alternate delivery point rights.   
	--Prices continue to abate, with some in California declaring the energy crisis over  

4. Likely Litigation Outcome
	--Little or no chance of a complete win
	--No party proposed refunds or unwinding of the deals as a remedy, but ALJ could recommend it
	--No party proposed elimination of TW's negotiated rate authority, but ALJ could recommend it
	--Some additional changes in tariff and posting procedures almost certain   
	--ALJ likely to defer difficult decisions on refunds and negotiated rate policy to the Commission 

5.  Settlement Recommendation
	--Staff has initiated discussions; ball is in our court to make a specific proposal
	--Recommend proposal to Staff that includes some or all of the following points:
		*limited moratorium for next heating season on additional index-index contracts on operational capacity	
		*future operational capacity sales all done through interactive open season
		*new posting and capacity allocation procedures in the tariff, with most discretion eliminated 	
		*TW makes many of the tariff and posting changes advocated by Indicated Shippers (i.e., pro rata allocation) 
		*TW offers to upgrade the EBB to a ""fully interactive, next generation EBB"" as soon as operationally feasible 
	--TW and Staff will try to get all interested parties on board after general framework nailed down.

"Southern Trails/Regent Power Plant","Per our phone conversation this morning.....

I know you are well aware of these happenings (Southern Trails disappointing CPUC decision and the KMI Sonoran pipeline to California) but I thought these two articles were timely.

Since it sounds like the Southern Trails gas is getting stranded wouldn't it be great if we could give KMI some competion for the new Power Plant being proposed in the four corners area.  Southern Trails might be willing to offload some of the system cheap following the outcome of the CPUC decision.  You may or may not be aware, but TW was working with D. Hawkins at providing operating services of this Souther Trails system for Questar so we have pretty good info. on the Questar system (or Don does I would guess). Anyhow, I know the Southern Trails system has to be in close proximity to this proposed power plant.   (If I am driving you nuts with this junk mail Kim, please let me know.)  


Southern Trails Disappointed by CPUC Decision; Decision Discourages
Development of New Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity


SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Officials from Questar Southern Trails
Pipeline Co. today expressed disappointment with the California Public
Utility Commission's (CPUC) Aug. 2, 2001, ruling on Southern California Gas
Company's (SoCal Gas) Residual Load Service (RLS) tariff.

""The CPUC's proposed new peaking rate, while an improvement over SoCal's
current RLS tariff, still does not level the playing field,"" said D.N. Rose,
Southern Trails president and CEO.  ""It punishes customers who want to take
partial service from a SoCal competitor, and it will discourage the
development of new pipelines inside California.""

Under the CPUC's proposed new peaking rate, new gas-fired power plants
wanting natural gas service from both SoCal Gas and a new competing pipeline
will pay a higher rate for SoCal's service than captive customers taking
service entirely from SoCal.  In addition, new power plants would be subject
to more restrictive balancing services than captive customers and would pay
even more for interruptible service than California power plants in other
parts of the state.

Rose noted the previous RLS tariff was so punitive that not a single customer
has taken service from a competing pipeline since the RLS was enacted in
1995.  The new SoCal peaking rate, while not as onerous as the RLS tariff,
will likely preserve SoCal's monopoly in Southern California.  ""The CPUC's
peaking rate is anti-competitive,"" Rose said.  ""Neither PG&E (Pacific Gas &
Electric) nor any interstate pipeline enjoys such protection from
competition.""

Questar is seeking entry into the California market with its Southern Trails
Pipeline project, which could deliver 120 million cubic feet of natural gas
daily to Southern California.  Questar purchased the former crude-oil
pipeline in November 1998.  The existing 16-inch-diameter pipeline runs about
700 miles from New Mexico, through Arizona, and into California, traveling
through San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and Los Angeles counties to Long
Beach.  The project received both federal and state certification last year
and has completed extensive environmental reviews.

The eastern zone of the Southern Trails Pipeline, which extends from the Four
Corners area to the California state line, is fully contracted.  Questar
expects to have it in service by mid-2002.

Rose indicated that the future of the California section of Southern Trails
is uncertain.  While not abandoning efforts to put the pipeline into natural
gas service, the company will be forced by the unfavorable CPUC decision to
consider alternative uses for the California portion, including possible
conversion to transport crude oil or other liquid petroleum products.

Questar Southern Trails is a subsidiary of Questar Corp. (NYSE: <A
HREF=""aol://4785:STR"">STR</A>), a $2.5 billion diversified natural gas
company headquartered in Salt Lake City. Through subsidiaries, Questar
transports natural gas through a 2,000-mile system in Utah, Colorado, New
Mexico and Wyoming.  The company also serves as the primary natural gas
distributor in Utah, offering services similar to those offered by SoCal Gas
and PG&E in California.


Regent Energy Corporation and Millennium Energy Ventures Sign Power
Generation Accord for 500 MW Plant Estimated at $250 Million Capital Cost


HOUSTON, Aug. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Regent Energy Corporation (OTC Bulletin
Board: RGEY) (""Regent"") today executed a contract with Millennium Energy
Ventures (""MEVCO""), a private Houston-based venture capital and project
development company (www.mevco.com ), to develop an electric plant with 500
MW generating capacity (estimated cost $250 million) on Regent's Horseshoe
Gallup lease in San Juan County, New Mexico.  Ownership of the project is 75%
Regent and 25% MEVCO.

Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting estimated at 6 to 9
months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same.
Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the
financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing.

Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the
acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio
Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcfpd
current production.  This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of
the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San
Juan producers.

Phillip Gennarelli, Managing Director of MEVCO said, ""We are pleased to be
involved in this project with Regent.  The addition of more producing
properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe
Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners
Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture
of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both
companies.""

John Ehrman, President of Regent commented, ""The additional production from
producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently
producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with
the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the
location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power
plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and
other western markets.  It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to
the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.""

The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in
purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near
Farmington, New Mexico.  Regent will be required to finance the acquisition
of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration.

Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the
interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a
transaction expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001,
giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

For more information call Phillip Gennarelli at (713) 409-6888 or Cheryl
Katzenstein at (281) 931-3800.

Kevin,

As a follow up to our recent discussions concerning the SoCalGas RLS or
peaking rate, I am forwarding to you the proposed decision of ALJ Brown.  My
understanding is that at yesterday's Commission meeting the Commission made
a decision to approve a change to the current peaking rate tariff.  I should
have their decision within a couple working days.  I am forwarding their
draft decision.

The expected PD rate design for the new peaking rate would include SFV rate
design principals, demand charges determined over highest recorded usage
over a 12 month period, and inclusion of public purpose program charges.  At
this point we'll call it a modified cost of service approach.

If you have any questions, please call.

Subject: 

Dear Colleague,

The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California
Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is
available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com
<http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on
the paper.

Here is a summary of the paper:

        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter
electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public
Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring
competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and
more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy
suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.

        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April
1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster
for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.
Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable
concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity
industry. 

        Although a few states have decided, based on the California
experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.
Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are
that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for
California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and
prices affect market outcomes.

        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity
regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred
beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance
to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity
industry. This section makes several points: 

*	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new
generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned
to meet growing loads. 

*	Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural
gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,
maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large
regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. 

*	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and
voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale
markets). 

*	Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with
artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to
offer retail services without favoring individual competitors. 

*	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply
and price risks. 

*	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,
ancillary services, and transmission congestion. 

*	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and
vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and
transmission). 


        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and
prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer
efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve
reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing
options. 

        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is
turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because
electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is
our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy
to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a
real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the
same time. 

        Although the problems that have occurred in California are
substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should
focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and
accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to
recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond
the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and
wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to
have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces
time varying prices. 

        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for
wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will
enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and
price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability
services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,
and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants
will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

"Griffith Interconnect Pressure","I'm going to try and clear this up:

Robert Francen (928-226-2219) with Citizens called about the Griffith interconnect a couple of weeks ago.  He made a request that we configure our flow control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pressure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to check with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was that by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to switch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pressure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutting TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I called and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in agreement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going to communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm not sure how to handle his request at this point.  

Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pressure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dramatically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ourselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then getting into competing issues with El Paso.  

I do not care how we configure this point.  However, again it could have implications for marketing and gas control so, I prefer that you all make that call.

"TW/  Agave","Following- up on our conversation regarding mercaptan sulfur on Agave's gas:


TW- Gas Quality requirements:	Shall not contain not more than .3 grains mercaptan sulfur per one 100 cubic of gas. Their letter indicates that it is 
more than 0.3 grains/ 100 cf. Therefore we have to tell them to treat the gas or TW has to install an instrument like Delmar 7200 with                     on -off shut- in devices to monitor the mercaptan in the gas at the receipt point.

Again, this is from the planning point of view and perhaps we need to talk to Operations also.

"RE: Mavrix:  ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE","my thought was that if some of the capacity is unsold after 60 days, Mavrix has to pay TW 100 cents on the dollar, on an npv basis.  I know that could result in a double recovery if we then resell the space, but what the heck!

Drew,

If TW cannot sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days, then will TW then take the financial risk after this time and not hold Mavrix responsible for the difference? This may be OK as we may wish to re-sell the capacity in different packages of time.   KW.

Subject:	Mavrix:  ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation contracts.  Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue shortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer at the same or better rate within 60 days.  I believe this approach allows TW to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financial risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release them from their contract obligations without penalty.  

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance that a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came from.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that  ""capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons including contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity.""  If the questioning customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, the confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants more detail, is that ""Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business and terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract termination subject to an indemnity or ""keep whole"" mechanism."" 

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow up on this later today.  DF

"RE: Transwestern Red Rock Expansion","Keith,

	If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new compressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existing units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken out of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we should be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragraph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in service within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., continue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and placed into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operating compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension for the abandonment.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

have just finished giving the majority of our initial presentations to
Mayo's various leadership committees.  We have received very favorable

Subject:	New Mexico Power Plant Project

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

"TW FTS Agreements","Michelle,

	I forget that you started with the team after I quit working on the TW Agreements; here's a brief update on what our ""normal"" process was previously.  We can change anything if you've found a better process...

The Deal Capture Team (Craig & Esther) processes all FTS discount related amendments for TW Marketing.  The Contract Group processes the new (base) agreement and any POI/MDQ/TERM type changes.  All FTS service requests still go to Contracts and, after the Capacity/Credit issues are completed and the contract printed out, the entire contract folder is forwarded to Deal Capture for additional processing (all firm contracts/amendments get sent to Deal Capture for review).  Deal Capture gets with the Marketer to determine if a Discount is being offered and then creates the Discount Amendment, Routes it for approval (if needed) and Tenders all documents to the Shipper.  Deal Capture is responsible for obtaining all approvals other than Capacity and Credit.  When (if) the Agreement is executed and returned by the Shipper, Deal Capture will handoff the original documents back to Contracts for activation and to complete all additional distribution and processing.  Let me know if you have any concerns or questions.  As the first few deals go through, we'll need your feedback to see if the process needs some adjustments.  Thanks for all your help...

Craig

"ETS Year-end Performance Evaluation Process","
The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

You might want to send these to Kim 

Some brief comments:

1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period of at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiration date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before the expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as this is optionality without any cost to them. 
2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to establish an ""Initial Recourse Rate"" prior to the open season in order for their proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the ""proportionate reduction"" requested. 

We need to get Paul Cherry working on the credit of MGI Supply ASAP.

"TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)","
DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

"Ferry","I have found a ferry that appears to be the shortest/cheapest, but still
have more investigating to do.
If you go drive from Palermo down to Messina, you can  cross to Villa San
Giovanni. About 200 km.(2 hrs)
 There are ferries every 15 minutes. The cost depends on the size of the
car, but is anywhere from 30,000 
to 61,000 ITL. That is 14.00 USD to 28.00 USD. That would make your drive
farther. You can find the crossing
at the narrowest strait between Sicily and the mainland near  Reggio di

"WT Leg Issues","Kim-

Listed below are the issues, pretty much as written, in the meeting on the West Texas Leg.  Some are self-explanatory while others are somewhat cryptic.  I will follow up with a list that better defines each issue, and you might have your guys think about each as well.  We'll get back together soon (I'm not sure I can do it this week), and discuss an action plan.

-	CS 9 fuel
-	Atoka Lateral 	We have both supply and market opportunities within the lateral itself
-	Turbocharge the Atoka #3 units
-	Look at Zia pressure obligation on the contract
-	Agave replacement gas at Atoka #3
-	Complete the loop between WT-1 and WT-2
-	Coolers to WT-2
-	Pecos compressor re-wheel and engine upgrade
-	200 	300 (WT-2 to Pecos) flow study
-	Look at Block Valve 16 bi-directional interconnect w/Sid Richardson, and ability flow incremental above 340 on the total system
-	Look at Keystone into NNG; back to TW south of WT-2
-	Check pressure of Stations 6 & 7, and PNM receipts
-	MAOP restriction on Panhandle leg due to encroachment

Let's talk.

Thanks,

Subject: Southern Trails Due Diligence

Kim, Mark listed below are the ETS Operations employees that will participate in the Southern Trails due diligence October 29th and 30th in Salt Lake City, Utah.

	L.D. Stephens - Team Leader/Operations
	Larry Campbell - Environmental
	???????? - ROW (To be determined by Johnny McGee and communicated directly to you)
	Mike Ames - Pipeline Safety

As discussed, these employees will arrive in Salt Lake, Sunday evening, October 28th prepared to go to the data room Monday 29th and Tuesday 30th.  They will return to their respective home locations Wednesday morning, October 31st.

Please provide a Questar contact person and address of the data room.  If you could also provide the name of a hotel close to the data room, it would be appreciated.
Names of other Enron parties participating in the due diligence and where they are staying would be helpful.  Any specific limitations imposed upon the data room review
should be communicated as soon as possible.

Morris Brassfield (Operations Support) and Jerry Martin (E&C) have determined that it is not necessary for them to have personnel attend the data room.  The operations team will retrieve as much information as possible to support their needs.  It was also my understanding no one from Planning and System Optimization would participate.

As I will be out of town the rest of the week, please communicate directly with these individuals via e mail.  If you need to need to contact me, I can be reached at 713-303-2764.

DIRECTIONS FROM LISA:

Hello Everyone-  Here are detailed directions to the beach cabin for the
Nov. 30  girl's weekend.


Directions to the Polk Beach Cabin:

Go south on IH-45.

Take the Harborside Dr. exit when you get to Galveston and turn left
under the highway (this is the first exit after crossing the causeway,
so be watching for it).

Travel approx. 6 miles on Harborside Dr. to Ferry Rd.

Turn left on Ferry Rd., go to the end, and catch the ferry to Bolivar (
this is a free drive-on ferry operated by the Texas Hwy Dept.).

After exiting the ferry you will be on Bolivar Peninsula Hwy 87.  Travel
approximately 11.5 miles to the Emerald II edition (the Crystal Beach
water tower is a good land mark when you are getting close and the
Emerald II edition is the first road after the post office).

Turn right into Emerald II (there is a small green sign).  After
entering, turn left on Flamingo, and follow the curve around to
Eastview.  The cabin is on the right about half way down and is located
on the corner of Eastview and Crestview.  The address is 919 Eastview
and ""J.S. Polk"" is written on the side.

The telephone # is 409-684-0195.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone!!

"Mavrix:  ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE","Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation contracts.  Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue shortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer at the same or better rate within 60 days.  I believe this approach allows TW to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financial risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release them from their contract obligations without penalty.  

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance that a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came from.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that  ""capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons including contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity.""  If the questioning customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, the confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants more detail, is that ""Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business and terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract termination subject to an indemnity or ""keep whole"" mechanism."" 

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow up on this later today.  DF

Steve,

I would like your assistance to ensure the timely collection of our transportation accounts receivables.  There is something your group can do to help assure the successful collection of Transwestern's $12,000,000 next week.  Please forward this email to the TW marketers and ask them to assist Gas Logistics in this process by having a conversation (similar to what is described below) with their marketing counterpart if they are the marketer for any of the customers listed below:
Please call your marketing counterpart and (after making some small talk about Enron) reassure them that Transwestern is fine and ongoing business will continue uninterrupted.  Then slip in that you understand that this is a busy time of the year and marketing normally doesn't get involved in payment issues unless there is some type of major problem, BUT, you have a different type of request/favor to ask of them.  You can tell them that with all of the changes at Enron lately, Transwestern moved the bank account that receives our wire transfer payments for our reservation, commodity and imbalance cash accounts.  Tell them that Gas Logistics posted the notice and the new account information on the web as well as included letters in with the reservation and commodity invoices mailed on December 3rd notifying them of this bank account change.  HOWEVER, you don't really know whether you can trust the ""accounting geeks"" or others who handle the details to have actually made the changes in their system to revise the bank information and that you are asking them to call internally within their company to follow up.  Please ask them specifically to pass along the new wiring instruction information as follows:
Bank Name:	Citibank, NA
Address:		New York, NY
ABA #:		021000089
Account #:		30454716
Beneficiary:	Transwestern Pipeline		

I almost feel like I need to apologize for asking you to place this redundant call, but we all understand the criticalness of receiving Transwestern's cash in our own bank account.  Thank you for the help and we will forward control reports to you next week.

  Attached is a proposed PHC Statement as required by ALJ Brown in her Ruling of November 5, 2001.  Per that Ruling, this Statement must be filed within 10 days of our meeting (which by my calculation would be the 26th of November).  I would REALLY like to get it filed on the 21st if possible, before the Thanksgiving weekend.
  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus views articulated at the meeting.  I tried not to go into too much detail on the description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect this case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you want to ""sign on.""  I will incorporate any non-substantive edits you may have.  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my best to incorporate.  However, let's remember that none of us want to be de-positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements will be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on behalf of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive changes are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for your cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your individual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's name off this one. 
Thanks again.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of November 11, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks ?

     The Principle of Just Noticing

   One of the fastest ways out of the fear that our current global
crisis can cause in us is to develop the skill of ""just noticing"" what
our reaction of life is. When we fail to notice what is we miss life as
it is. We do this because we try to make ourselves safe and secure -
especially from death. Just noticing is build on the principle of
""sacred unity.""

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

       Full text of presentation

   I'm calling the remarks I want to make with you today ""Just
Noticing.""

   We are attempting to learn how to be with the world as it is. And
with ourselves as we are.

   These are big tasks because the world as it is currently a scary
place with an uncertain future. And we as we are turn out to be a mixed
bag, some of which is hard to accept.

   Last week I introduced you to what are, at least for me, some key
concepts.

   First, were the principles of mind and spirit.
   Second, the process of learning to make life work for us in a way
that fits the goal of ""living the life we want and wanting the life we
live."" Some of you have wondered: ""Is it really possible to do this?
Can we really love and accept ourselves and each other
unconditionally?""

   One very important spiritual skill is learning just to notice.

   Just be with what is.

   Yes, this is difficult to do with no judgment. But it is one of our
primary spiritual tasks. If we cannot learn to relate to ourselves this
way, we cannot relate to others with kindness or compassion either.

   Several years ago a man walked into a bar in San Francisco near the
waterfront. After he had ordered his drink, he noticed that the man
sitting next to him looked like a sea-going pirate. Not only was he
dressed the part but he had a peg-leg, a hook instead of a hand and he
had a patch over one eye.
   Curiosity got the better of him so he asked the man to tell him
about himself.
   ""Excuse me, but you look like a pirate.""
   ""Aye mate, that I was. A true sea-going pirate.""
   ""My but you must have had an interesting life judging from the looks
of things.""
   ""Aye lad, that I have.""
   ""Do you mind telling about your adventures? For example, how did you
come to have a peg-leg?""
   ""Well, I was a pirate you know. One day a huge wave came and knocked
me off the ship and a shark bit my leg clean off. That's why I have a
peg-leg.""
   ""And your arm? How did you come by that hook?""
   ""Well, I was a pirate you know. One night in a bar in Singapore I
got in a fight and this guy took a machete and cut my arm clean off.
That's how I got my hook.""
   ""And how about your eye? How did you lose your eye?""
   ""Well, I was a pirate you know. One day while up on deck I happened
to look up and a sea gull pooped in my eye?""
   ""A sea gull pooped in your eye and that's how you lost your eye?""
   ""Well, it was the day after I got my hook.""

   There is a profound wisdom in learning to be with life as it is.
Something happens and immediately we react rather than just noticing.
When we do that we can blind ourselves. So often we want to escape
life. What I want our times together to help us all do is to develop a
loving and compassionate relationship toward life as it is and toward
ourselves as we really are.

   One way to talk about this is with the phrase ""just noticing."" The
foundation of this ""noticing"" is the principle of spiritual unity.

   When Jesus used the word ""God,"" the word that he used in Aramaic
means ""that which encompasses everything both outside and inside.""

   This includes those things we label ""good"" and those things we label
""bad."" Both within the world and within ourselves. This is one of the
reasons we are encouraged to know ourselves as completely as possible.
You can't love what you don't know or know what you don't love.

   Jesus was constantly inviting people toward himself in one way or
another. Indeed, I think one of the true marks of the spiritual life-
style I would aspire to is that it be one that is inviting. I would
like for people to find what we are up to in here, for example, to be
intriguing, appealing, etc.

   ""Come, follow me,"" he said.

   ""Come and see what I have found,"" said his followers.

   So Jesus embraced and invited everyone. Indeed, his hanging out with
sinners, prostitutes and drunks - his inclusiveness if you will - got
him into far more trouble than anything he ever said about himself.

   This is a manifestation of the Jewish principle of wisdom, called
""Sophia."" In the Old Testament book of Proverbs you find Wisdom
gathering various guests together.

   At the time of Jesus there were very strict rules in Judaism about
whom you could eat with and whom you couldn't and he regularly and
deliberately disobeyed those rules. By violating these rules Jesus
modeled the nature of God's love. God invites and includes all.

   The word Jesus used for ""God,"" means ""no boundaries."" No one and
nothing is excluded. So our spiritual work involves attempting to
create our lives in light of this reality.

   Of course, the phrases ""being with life as it is"" and ""learning to
embrace it all"" are what we talk about all the time in here in one way
or another.

   Here is a promise: the more you work with not running from the
things that scare you - whether within or without - and the more you
and I don't try to sidestep the feelings of insecurity that facing
these demons brings us, the more we will be at peace; the more joy we
will experience; the happier we will be.

   It is that simple.

   It is that difficult.

   Of course, the bottom line thing we try to run from and escape is ?
death.

   Once I had a very profound dream. It was disturbing beyond belief. I
would say that paying attention to and honoring this dream saved my
life. And by ""saved my life"" I don't mean it in the way we usually do.
It didn't keep me safe and secure.

   I dreamed that I was back in Columbia, Tennessee the town where I
lived from age six until age seventeen or eighteen. I had gone back
there because I had some sort of business to conduct with the
undertaker. (You understand that we take nothing in a dream as literal.
Dream symbols are much more serious than that.) While I was waiting for
the undertaker to finish whatever he was doing and come to our meeting,
I was looking around this place. Off of the vestibule where I stood
waiting, there were numerous visitation rooms. Each seemed to have
several caskets in it. Each casket contained a corpse.

   I looked over to the room on my right and there was a casket in
which the body in it seemed to be breathing. I walked over to it and
there, plain as day, was my dad. All laid out but clearly not dead. He
was breathing!

   Now, in the dream I had no emotional reaction to this whatsoever. I
just noticed it. I went back to the vestibule to wait.

   Soon the undertaker came out.

   He had on a white lab coat with blood stains on it. Blood in dreams
always refers to sacrifice. (We don't like to make sacrifices!)

   I said to him, ""Before we get down to business, I thought you might
like to know that the body in that casket over there isn't dead.""

   ""Oh yes, we know. He is about to die. You see, he is afraid of the
pain of the process of being embalmed. We're keeping an eye on him. As
soon as he is dead, we are going to close the casket and bury him.""

   That seemed to make sense to me so I said, ""Okay"" and we got about
our business - which I have no idea what it was.

   When I woke, the dream seemed like it had been so real. I was very
disturbed by it. Remember, there are no bad dreams - just disturbing
ones. What could it possibly mean?

   I worked with that dream for weeks. What in me was afraid of dying?
Of the process of being embalmed?

   The ego.

   The ego thinks it is the whole show and is terrified about having
the life sucked out of it.

   This is why I say to you that the spiritual practice I am attempting
to teach in here has nothing to do with believing anything religious -
at least not at first. It has most of all to do with our being willing
to die and to do this dying on a continuous basis.

   Just when we are sure that we've found the truth, that we have a
place to stand, that we are safe and secure; life as it is - or God -
comes along and says, ""Let that go!""

   Sometimes this command is whispered to us and is so subtle we miss
it if we aren't careful. Sometimes it is yelled so loudly in our ears
that it echoes there for a long, long time.

   This is why I have cautioned you about the danger of putting labels
on anything.

   For example:
   ""I'm married."" Then my spouse leaves by death or divorce.
   ""I'm wealthy."" Then the market crashes.
   ""I'm young and healthy."" ""What do you mean it's malignant?
   ""I'm a safe and secure citizen of the United States of America.""
Then comes along 9/11.

   Almost nowhere do we get taught the folly of running away from that
which scares us. Instead we are taught to cover it up, make the bitter
sweet, smooth it over so no one will pay attention, take a pill,
distract yourself and don't think about it. By all means, by any means
make it go away.

   The saddest thing about how we are taught to deal with the fear we
have of the various deaths we need to face is that each and every
method causes us to cheat ourselves out of being in the present moment.

   Pema Chodron in her wonderful book ""When Things Fall Apart: Heart
Advice for Difficult Times"" talks about the wisdom of being nailed to
the present moment. I thought, when I first read that phrase, of one
who was willing to be so nailed and the powerful impact he had because
of that willingness.

   One of the negative contributions organized religion has made to our
lives is that it tries to organize things. Which, of course, it must.
But organized religion begins to create God in its image. Each
religious group becomes so certain of what it is that God wants and
believes.

   But you notice that what God wants and believes varies from group to
group. You get the suspicion that the beliefs have been shaped to
support and affirm the religious organization's existence and culture.
I have a suspicion that this is one of the leading causes of atheism.

   The spiritual path I am attempting to apprehend and talk about isn't
about getting someplace - at least not the place that organized
religion talks about. We're not trying to get to heaven or be ""right.""

   I grew up, as did some of you, in a church that emphasized the
importance of ""being saved.""

   To this day when I go to visit my Dad in Columbia, Tennessee - where
that funeral home is - if I go to church with my dad, the service is
just like it was when I was a child. There is almost no one in that
church under fifty. My dad is 93. Yet, every sermon and every service
is focused on the unsaved.

   A phrase that some folks used briefly after 9/11 ""when will things
get back to normal. ""Normal"" is one of the most useless words in our
vocabulary. Things are not normal - except in this sense: Things come
together and they fall apart. Then they come together again. Then they
fall apart again. This is the way of ordinary life. Our healing lies in
creating room for this sort of thing to happen. Room to love. Then to
grief. Then to feel relief. Then misery and joy that frees us to love
again and start the process all over again.

   Do you see why I say that the spiritual journey isn't about getting
it together or getting to heaven? In fact, looking for a secure safe
place is what keeps us miserable.

   Just noticing what is going on right here and now and what our
reaction to it is, this noticing becomes our teacher. That's what
meditation is about. Learning to notice. We don't meditate in order to
become good meditators. We meditate so that we will wake up. If someone
were to ask me, ""How long does this take?"" my answer would be: ""The
rest of our lives.""

   Many people are out seeking for some special religious and/or
spiritual path to take them to bliss. All sorts of things are available
for that. Some try the drug Ecstasy. Some try weekend workshops of all
sorts. Some go off and follow someone who can channel a long dead
person into the present moment. These dead folks always seem to be so
wise. Are there no dead jerks? And on and on. All these are efforts to
transcend life as it is. My assertion is that it is only when we are
willing to be with ordinary life that we are free to really to live.

   You see, as long as I am pre-occupied with the hope that there is
somewhere else that is better to be or that there is someone else
better to be, I'm not able to be with where I am and who I am right
here, right now.

   I remember when I first heard the notion that suffering doesn't mean
that something is wrong. What a relief! Suffering is part of life. Life
is difficult. We don't suffer because we've done something wrong or
weren't good enough. To believe that is spiritual poverty. Spiritual
poverty is always experiencing ""I'm not good enough or haven't done
enough; that there is something missing in me.""

   I strongly believe that our efforts to protect ourselves from sorrow
and hardship are not being kind to ourselves. We get taught in this
culture on the importance of getting it all together and feeling good.
So that if we are experiencing an upset of some kind, we think that
something is wrong and we have to get it fixed. When we take this
approach, we inevitably become bitter, hardened, unavailable, fearful
and alienated. In our effort to avoid sorrow and hardship we end up
living tensely - it's like living your whole life in the dentist chair.

   When we suffer, it doesn't mean something is wrong.

   If you had a child or best friend who felt that that they were
inadequate or fundamentally flawed, what you would do is put your arms
around them and say, ""No, you are fine, just the way you are."" Then you
might help the child or your friend explore why they felt so bad.
Understand? We can explore the nature of our feeling inadequate without
believing that we are inadequate.

   [At the point each person in the Ordinary Life Gathering was given a
raisin. We spent time ""just noticing"" the raisin.]

   Now a raisin is a small thing. But what if it is your spouse or
partner that you are not noticing? What if it is your health? What if
it is your surroundings?

   One of the first things I learned when I began to do sitting
meditation is how much time I spend not in the moment. Rather I am busy
planning, thinking about the next item on my ""to do list,"" how I'm
going to get done all I have scheduled for myself. One main goal of
spiritual practice is just to notice.

   These are dark times. Learning to notice and then practicing loving-
kindness and compassion toward ourselves is as good a way as I know for
us to start turning lights on in the darkness so that we and others can
see.

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.

"Ferry","
Kim, The info I have on the ferry is this:
It is not much more expensive to have a deluxe cabin. Since one never knows
about Italian accomodations,
I would go with it. It is the old ferry boat that goes this route on Oct 7.
Departs at 20.45 (8:45pm) and
arrives at 06.30 (6:30am) on the 8th.
The deluxe cabin is 105,000 ITL each (approx 50.00 USD). It is not clear.
but it seems that the reservations fee
is 94,000 ITL (about 45.00 USD)  While the cabin rate is per person, the res
fee is per cabin, I believe.
The regular cabin is 47.00 each  and 42.00 res.
The car rate is 56.00 and res fee is 53.00. Now, I am guessing on this, as
their is no clear explanation.
It could be that there is a discount if you make a res ahead of time, i.e.
42.00 for prior res and 47.00 if
you show up at departure time. Same as passenger/cabin fee. It may mean
45.00 with prior res or
50.00 if you show up. I'll let you know when I receive an answer. It may be
next week as I just e-mailed
the request this morning.

"Bullets","Calpine - Meet with Calpine to discuss Red Rock FT.  Calpine has been allocated 33,529 MMBtu out of their 40,000 MMBtu Red Rock contract for receipts from the West Texas Pool.  They have indicated this is not satisfactory and may pursue (I'm not sure how) this in the future.  We are still working towards designating specific receipt points for their entire MDQ.

SoCal - Jeff Dasovitch made initial contact with the CPUC about SoCal's unwillingness to confirm TW volumes at the SoCal Topock point on an alternate basis.  He would like TW to continue in its efforts to keep these discussions going as well.  (Rick Ishikawa is out on vacation this week and I have a call into him.)  This week, Richardson Products contacted So Cal about this issue as well.  Calpine is also interested in having the flexibility under its Red Rock contract to deliver gas to Socal Topock (on an alternate basis) and is meeting with SoCal next week and will discuss this with them.

OBAs - I have made initial contact with all my volumetric OBA parties to begin discussions on resolving payback and going forward on the tariff OBA.

"Albuquerque Cross Functional Meeting","I made room reservations for the 3 of us on November 5 only at the Sheraton Uptown (505-881-0000).  The rooms are not guaranteed past 6:00 pm.  Our confirmation numbers are as follows.

		Ron M.		118587
		Darrell S.	118588
		Dennis A.	118590

I checked on flights and the best bet is a 2:30 pm flight arriving Albuquerque at 3:36 pm (next one wouldn't get in until 7:37 pm).  Flights back to Houston are 2:40 pm and 4:30 pm arriving at 5:37 & 7:37 pm respectively.  I vote for the 4:30 pm flight to make sure we don't run short on time.  

LET ME KNOW ASAP MONDAY TO BOOK.  Right now the fare is  $156.25 & non-refundable.  Not sure what it will be Monday.

Kim,

I don't know your plans in and out of Albuquerque so I didn't book a room for you.  I thought you were headed elsewhere from Albuqueruque.  Let me know if you want me to do something on arrangements.

All, 

Here is the link to the new TW Daily Unsubscribed Capacity Report in our test environment:  http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap_unsub_links.html

You can also navigate to the test site through the menu starting at http://twdev.ets.enron.com/, then selecting:  Informational Postings/Capacity/Unsubscribed/Unsubscribed Daily.

Please keep in mind........We realize there is a lot of left to right, right to left scrolling on this report and definitely will not be printer friendly, but in the limited timeframe we have to get this on the site this was the quickest and simplest way to do this.  With a little time we will see how we can make this report more functional for the users.

Thx,

Toby

Subject:	Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report

UPDATE--Yesterday it was suggested that if Legal were to concur we would post capacity for a rolling 31 day period such that we would effectively be posting capacity which could be sold for one day up to 29 or 30 days so long as it was less than one full month.
Legal has agreed we can interpret the Order to allow this type of posting and Marketing has agreed with the idea as well.  Hence the IT people have reworked the Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report to reflect a rolling 31 day period.  Toby will be sending out the link to review the example today.  The filing at FERC and the initial report will still indicate that no daily capacity is currently available.  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at X7419.  Thanks.  gh

SoCalGas is circulating a draft pre-hearing conference statement for parties to sign on to, if they wish (please see attached).  Given Transwestern's position in the BCAP, it makes sense to sign on to SoCalGas' generic PHC statement.  Please take a few moments to review the same and let me know your thoughts.  SoCalGas has asked for a response by Tuesday noon.  Thanks.

To: Parties Who Participated in the A.01-09-024 (SoCalGas and SDG&E BCAP) Meet and Confer: 
  Attached is a proposed PHC Statement as required by ALJ Brown in her Ruling of November 5, 2001.  Per that Ruling, this Statement must be filed within 10 days of our meeting (which by my calculation would be the 26th of November).  I would REALLY like to get it filed on the 21st if possible, before the Thanksgiving weekend.
  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus views articulated at the meeting.  I tried not to go into too much detail on the description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect this case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you want to ""sign on.""  I will incorporate any non-substantive edits you may have.  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my best to incorporate.  However, let's remember that none of us want to be de-positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements will be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on behalf of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive changes are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for your cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your individual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's name off this one. 
Thanks again.
