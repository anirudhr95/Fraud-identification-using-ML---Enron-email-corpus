Sounds like we will be dealing with Rodger Swenke and not Bob Betonte or Richard Ishiwaka on GISB issues from now on.  Does anyone know Rodger or know what his duties are at Socal Gas?

Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,

It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to 
support Bob's participation in our organization.

The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke, Senior 
Pipeline Products Project Manager, SoCal Gas, to take the open seat on the 
EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob 
for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with 
SoCal Gas.     

Best Regards,  Rae

Thanks for your recent message.
I spent the last couple of days in Phoenix testifying on Big Sandy
project and just picked up your message.
I would look forward to visiting with you sometime Friday AM.
Let me know if this works, or perhaps next week some time.
I will be in Denver M-W, and then returning to my office on Th/F of next

"FW: 2001 actual distributions","Steve,

FYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001.  However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left Enron in June and Sean and Richard moved to Jo's RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year.  Martha and Bobby were the only ones in this RC that were part of this allocation all 12 months. 

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,  This is to update you regarding the status of getting real-time Nymex pricing on the TW desktops on Level 13.  We are taking a quick hit approach and will be providing the data as it is fed from DTN and as it appears below.  Our next steps (once the feed is active) will include providing average price strips across seasons, remainder of seasons, and calendar years.  There are some contracting issues that exist which Mark Ferguson and I are addressing.  However, we will use interim steps if necessary to provide this data to you by next Wednesday before the NNG marketers leave the building.  I will continue to work with Paul Y'Barbo regarding the details of this request.  Paul and I are also working on getting both ICE and Dynegy Direct access for everyone in the TW commercial group.

"I've lost my mind","Jeff,

I am looking for the person who paid for my wine last Friday evening.  Lorraine says it was not her, so I'm suspecting that it was you.  Needless to say, I left without paying and what is worse, I didn't even think of it until I got home that night after dinner with John.  Where you the kind and unknowing one that floated my loan?

Also, I've been thinking about Paris and London.  Would a week night or weekend night be better for you/Lisa and John/I to get together for a brain, map and book transfer session.  If you have a date that works for you guys over the next few weeks, throw it out and we'll get something on the calendar.  

Thanks, Kim.

P.S.  What is Lisa's email address?  I'd like to send her a note.

I've made a couple of changes related to ENA having two contracts that we want to market via this method.  Please check my comments and look to see if any of the other language needs to be changed for the additional agreement.  The letter looks great to me.  Thanks for all of your help on this.  Once we hear back from you, we will tender to ENA for their execution so we can proceed forward in selling this capacity.

PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION

FROM GREG PORTER

We have agreed with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group lead by Rick Miles, to meet in Chicago on December 4, 2001 to begin mediation.  In anticipation of mediation, over the next month we will be meeting to prepare our mediation presentation and discuss potential settlement scenarios and strategies. We will have a better sense after the mediation session on December 4th whether SoCalGas is serious about its desire to resolve this proceeding amicably.  SoCalGas' lawyer has represented to me that they are interested in settlement and ""prepared at some level"" to compromise.  

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"RE: Bullets","Lorraine, 

When you get back in the office, let's talk about the new interest to connect into the SJ Hub.  I, too, have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the Hub.  We should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the Hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward.

Also, FYI, in your EDG comment below, our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has contacted TW with interest in tying in the Blanco and Chaco Plants on the San Juan Lateral.  A tentative meeting has been scheduled for 8/10 to meet with EPFS to discuss locations and cost estimates.  (I need Ron to go with me).

Amoco Florida - BP has requested TW consider increasing the meter at the Amoco Florida Plant.  Currently, it is sized for receipts of 165,000 MMBtu/d and BP is interested in doubling the size of the interconnect.  I am waiting on a Facility Planner.

Red Rock filing - a filing was made on 7/31 to FERC requesting approval to utilize an incremental 5 acres at each station for construction purposes.  A Director's Letter must be received because of this change in our construction procedures and is expected to be issued by FERC within 2 to 3 weeks.

NGPL Eddy - I have received Facility Planning's preliminary comments on the Interconnect Agreement and am still awaiting Legal's comments in order to return TW's comments to NGPL.  

Energy Development Group - I have attempted to continue to try to work with EDG to locate TW's pipe in specific locations in AZ and NM in order for them to better site power plants off TW.  This week there have been no Facility Planners to help me with this and I have a call into Tiny for assistance.

Today's News	
 Allegheny Energy Supply Company, Salt River  Project and Sempra Energy Resources Announce Open Season for Proposed  Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation System   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]    PHOENIX, Jan. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- The Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation System (Desert Crossing) is holding an Open Season for customers interested in capacity, beginning today and extending through Feb. 8, 2002.     Open Season is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas storage capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeline, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purchase the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing system will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas storage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, north of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 miles from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage complex with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and southern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com ).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Project (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE ), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-responsive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwestern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on natural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along with past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region, have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline project attractive.     ""As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeline configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consumers' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation capacity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets,"" commented Michael Morrell, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. ""The increased storage and transportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective prices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas.""      SRP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David Areghini, concurred.  ""As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by adding new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossing project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consumers and others in the Southwest for many years.""     ""The additional natural gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, especially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest,"" said Dwain Boettcher, vice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. ""The hourly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to transform the way storage service is offered in the future.""     Customers participating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedented flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse gas supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize their portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's energy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the Open Season. Project scope and costs will be announced at the conclusion of the Open Season. To participate in the Open Season and for more information about Desert Crossing, visit http://www.desert-crossing.com .     Allegheny Energy, Inc. is a diversified energy company headquartered in Hagerstown, Md.

Kim,
Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday.  As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships.  It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey.  If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and/or send me their resume.
See you Sunday.

Mansoor,

The line north of the Blanco Hub Questar is tieing into is 30"".  The line number is NMBM154A1 with an MAOP of 1009 psig.  There is 1368' of pipe.  Only thing we don't know is exactly wher on the line Questar will tie into.  Other issue came up was the installation of a blowoff near the valve on the north end.  Currently can't blow the line down properly on that end.  North end of the line is up a hill and the team is afraid they can't get the gas out blowing down hill.  Kim is aware about the blowoff and the team will look into the cost.  They claim the team can't install with help from the region welders at a cheap costs.  Hope this is enough info.

Subject: Paris


John,
I need your advice.  My sister and I have decided to take a trip together
this fall.  We are interested in about a 6-7 day trip (does not include
travel days), splitting it between London and Paris.

We thought we'd fly to London and spend a few days, then take the tunnel
bullet train to Paris and spend a few day and return to London to fly home.

Our questions are:

1.  When is a better time to visit Paris, September or October - we want to
avoid high tourist season and maybe capitalize on lower hotel prices.

2.  My sister has visited London many times and has friends there, so we
won't have any trouble with an agenda, however, we've never been to Paris.

3.  For 2-3 days what would you recommend we do/see in Paris?
Highlights: the Louvre, the Orsay, Saint Chapelle (behind Notre Dame), the
sewer tour (I'm not kidding), shopping at Galleries Lafayette and Printemps,
the Eiffel Tower, other stuff?

4.  What reasonably priced hotels would you recommend in Paris?
Kim found one in the more residential area that is near ??

5.  Any other advice/tips?
Try to eat at Cafe/Bistro Bacchanal (something like that).  We ate there on
one trip and couldn't get in the next time.
Buy your Metro tickets by the carnet (10 at a time).

Thank you so much,
Jane

Just a quick note of appreciation for the invite to this Team Building session..    It won't mean much coming from an Advisor way out on the West end of TW, but none the less, you are both to be commended for putting this togeather.  I went through the same Personality Profile with all the Teams on the West End when I started this advisor thing, and going through it again reminded me of some of my interpersonal skills that need immediate attention.  

Oh yea, I don't know if either of you are interested or familiar with the Zenger Miller Team building training sessions that are offered through ETS.  Most of the advisors are certified facilitators and a variety of team building topics are available.  I'm not the best at facilitating these sessions but, I can certainly point you all in the right direction if there is an interest or we can provide a list of the various topics and course details....   (4 to 8 hours courses typically)  Anyhow, thanks again and have a good week....

Hey gang,

I just wanted you to know that I sent a fax early this week to cancel our hotel in Positano (Hotel Marincanto).  I did not receive a confirmation back from them, so I called them this morning.  Julio is the gentleman I talked to and he did inform me that the four rooms we had booked are cancelled.  I think we are OK, but I would feel better if we had written confirmation of the cancellation.  Please watch your credit card charges to ensure that you do not get billed for the hotel.

I have received written confirmation from the hotel in Rome (front end of trip) and the hotel in Florence of our cancellation.

Let's start looking at dates in 2002 to rebook this trip.  If one of you has some time, would you check to see if the weather would be better in May or June? Any thoughts? 

Thanks, Kim.

The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.

Subject:	New Mexico Power Plant Project

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,

It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to 
support Bob's participation in our organization.

The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke, Senior 
Pipeline Products Project Manager, SoCal Gas, to take the open seat on the 
EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob 
for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with 
SoCal Gas.     

Best Regards,  Rae

Subject:	RE: Transwestern EDI - Operationally Available and Unsubscribed Capacity


Everyone,

As stated below in Rich's memo, the quantities that will be posted in the new daily unsubscribed report are the same quantities that TW is currently sending in EDI files. As part of the permanent solution, the EDI process will need to be modied when the website is modified.

I would like to review messages that are sent in TW EDI files for unsubscribed capacity and operationally available capacity.

 TW currently sends a text message with each of the EDI unsubscribed capacity files that are sent to customers.  This message is:

	Capacity at these points is subject to the capacity available on the relevant path for the receipt and delivery point combination(s) requested. (2)  Please contact your Marketing Representative for information concerning point with capacity less than 5,000 Mcf/day. (3)  Transwestern is willing to consider expressions of interest concerning available capacity or requests for capacity.  Shipper interested in available capacity may either contact their Marketing Representative or submit a request for service to Transwestern Transportation Marketing, P.O.Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1199 or by facsimile to (713)646-8000.

For operationally available capacity, TW currently sends the following text message with each EDI operationally available file:

	The below listed capacity is an estimate of the unutilized capacity that will be available on the effective date above, until further notice is posted.  The capacity is only an estimate and is subject to change without notice due to the transient nature of pipeline operations.  There are no guarantees expressed or implied that this capacity will be available.  Formal nominations to the pipeline will be processed in accordance witht he company's tariff provisions for scheduling of all available capacity.

Please review and let me know if any revisions need to be made to the above text messages.

Thanks,
Mary

Subject:	

In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

Subject:	RE: Updated info on TW daily unsubscribed capacity

After having several conversations, I found out that TW's daily unsubscribed capacity will not actually match the monthly unsubscribed capacity.  The lowest of the numbers from the posting date to the end of the month will show up as the monthly number (i.e.  If the available capacity is 0 on the last day of the month, ""0"" will show up as the monthly number for the whole month).  I also found out that for on-line reporting, we can display the actual daily number from TW's CAS system.  EDI will continue to send out the monthly numbers which match the on-line monthly report.  EDI will continue this process until further analysis can be done.

Patty Hermanek will modify the daily report in Model Office and notify everyone when she is done.

	Subject:	

	In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

	This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

There are some outstanding AR issues regarding ftps for Westar/KN/Oneok.  I've tried to contact them and talked to 4 different people with no avail.  The last person said he's not so sure that they are valid.  I've got to locate the contract and send to him.  I believe I'm going to need marketing assistance in collecting.

At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.

SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.  SWG hopes to have a decision to move forward by year end 2001.

Subject:	Salt Domes

Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)

Kim,

At one time there was someone in marketing looking at developing salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

I'm with you.  If we can't make money, why enter into an agreement?   The team at Canadian is under the impression that they are going to be asked to run the units long term.   Not sure where this is coming from.
I think there are probably better places to put the units.

Randy:  I'm waiting to hear who has requested us to run the units, but if history is repeating, it is Duke wanting us to run them for 2-3 days to move their gas during an NNG outage.  I believe that even at maximum rates, we do not cover our costs.  No one in TW Marketing has heard from a shipper yet.  If it has been over a year since the units were last run, we have the option of abandoning them at any time.  What do you think?  Steve

Mike Flynn - Canadian Team:  These units are candidates for abandonment.  What day were each of these units last run?  If they have been idle for over one year we can abandon the units under automatic blanket authority.  If we run them, however, it postpones the abandonment-under-automatic-blanket-authority option by another year.  Please let me know ASAP.  Steve

Rick (FYI),

	Elizabeth informed me about a report she's been administering regarding all TW deliveries to California.  This is a new report that was created per an FERC order.  After discussion with the TW Admin team, it would seem appropriate that the Deal Capture team administer the FERC report at this time.  Elizabeth will begin the transition of this report to Deal Capture as soon as her schedule permits.  This report, along with some other TW Demand Rate admin pieces and the Firmbook, would be a significant part of the duties for the 3rd member of our Deal Capture team.

PS.  I will keep you posted on the ferry poll.  I still vote for arriving in Lucca earlier in the day, only because if we don't arrive untill evening, then we will spend the whole next day in Lucca instead of getting to Florence.  I'm trying to keep us (you and me) whole for 2 - 2.5 shopping days in Florence before heading to Rome.

Option 1 -Palermo to Naples (11 hrs) vs. Option 2 - Palermo to Livorno (18
hrs):

Option 1 - Afternoon in Sicily, early dinner, 2000 departure from Palermo,
0700 arrival in Naples, followed by a 6-hour drive to Lucca (arrive around
1300, assuming no stops).

Option 2 - Afternoon and evening in Sicily, normal dinner, 2300 departure
from Palermo, 1700 arrival in Livorno, followed by a 1-hour drive to Lucca.

Remember that these ferries have shopping and dining and other stuff.  If
the cost difference isn't much (Dee told me she's getting an exact cost from
the ferry companies), I vote for the longer ferry ride arriving closer to
our final destination.

J, D, P and J,

Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry
info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to
Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that
will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2
hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742
for each car).

FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but
none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few
of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on
the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for
Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.

Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.
She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told
her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She
is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on
a part time basis.

Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which
is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the
cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome
and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return
home.

I will keep you posted as we hear more.

Thanks, Kim.

I have 2 Alamo full size 4 dr/5 passenger  cars reserved for you. We do
not
have to prepay. The all-inclusive
rate is 1,617250. ITL (approx 742.00) for the 12 days. This includes
collision and theft insurance, taxes and
unlimited mileage. I think that this is very good. 1 car booked under
John
Watson and 1 under Dennis Dye.
They are manuals.

The ferry from Palermo to Naples is daily, departing at 800pm, arriving
700am. It looks as though the vehicles will cost between 111,600 and
134,600
each. The passengers in a double outside cabin are 96,500 to 111,500. )
I
believe, per passenger.

The ferry from Palermo to Livorno departs at 1100pm and arrives the next
day
about 5pm. The double outside suite is
240,000. The coach seat is 120,000. Each car is 175,000 to 205,000. I
need
to verify if the cabin rate includes the
passenger fee.

I had found a ferry to Salerno, but it only operates 1 day a week, not
the
day you need.
I'll get back to you.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Steve - at today's staff meeting, Danny McCarty asked to see the rate derivation of the Southern Trails pipeline with the conversion costs.

Could I get a copy as well?  I am working with Steve Dowd on evaluating the Questar pipeline and this is a big part of it.

Thanks.

Subject: your request for October 09 and 10 (two nights)


Dear Ms Watson,

thank you for your kind fax of yesterday and for your interest in our hotel.

I am afraid, but we do not have enough double rooms left available for the dates you require. If at all suitable for you, over the same dates we can offer you one of the following accomodations:
       - either TWO triple rooms     - OR one double room and one large room for four people
all our rooms have private shower/WC, color TV/radio, air conditioning and telephone.

The daily rate for such rooms in that period (extremely busy) is Lit. 320000 for each triple room OR Lit. 240000 for the double room and Lit. 400000 for the quadruple one, which at the moment works out to be around US$ 150+150 or 113+187 per night, including buffet breakfast and all taxes and service charges.

Should you wish to book (and I really hope so), we would need a confirmation e-mail or fax from you together with your Visa, Master, Amex or Diners' Club credit card number and expiration date, which will only prove as a guarantee of your arrival. Otherwise, you can e-mail or fax us the confirmation and then send us a cheque for the first night's amount, but this takes longer and is more expensive both on your and on our side. Please note that cancellations or amendments should be made in writing up to one week before arrival at the latest, otherwise the amount of the first cancelled night will be charged.

Our hotel is very centrally located only 150 yards away from Florence Cathedral and very close to all monuments and museum. In order to reach it from the Railway Station, there is a choice of three options:
- a taxi will cost around Lit. 12000 and is readily available from the main exit in front of tracks no. 8-9-10);
- by bus lines 11 or 17 from the side exit by track no. 5: get off at the stop after the Cathedral and walk another 50 yards on the other side of the street;
- walk all the way (8-10 minutes): leave the Station by the side exit by track no. 16, take the underpass to the right until the end of it and then keep going straight ahead for about 400 yards, until reaching the Cathedral (a massive white church): at that stage turn left into Via Martelli, which becomes Via Cavour after 50 yards.

I hope that we shall be able to warmly welcome you all to our small and family managed hotel and I can assure you that we shall endeavour to make your stay in Florence as pleasant as possible. 

Yours sincerely,

As of 11/11/01 SoCal's oba is a receivable of 358,416 mmbtus.  I know that we do not control the Needles point; however ????

SoCal's oba remains volumetric and a drop in index prices would cause a large dollar hit.

Subject:	ETS' TW Teams Appreciation Luncheon - Last Round


Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

Presidential Task Force on Oil spillage,Department
ofPetroleum Resources,
Victoria Island,Lagos Nigeria.BUSINESS PROPOSAL WORTH
$31.8 MILLION DOLLARS
STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL  Dear Sir,
This proposal is coming to you with the ardent belief
that you will take advantage of our goodwill and out
of our desperation to have a trusted foreign partner
whom we can entrust our funds with for safekeeping.
This is not a fairy tale but for real. I am
Dr.Dandyson Openam, the secretary to the
PresidentialTask force on
Oil spillage in my country. We are the 6th largest
producer of crude oil in the world and more often than
not, we always experience oil spillage in the Niger
Delta region of my country. These spillage causes a
lot of havoc to inhabitants of the community and hence
contracts are awarded especially to foreign firms to
clean and mop up the spilled crude oil from the areas
affected. The spillage sometimes cover several
kilometres and the value of contract also runs into
millions of dollars. Between 1999 to 2000, some
contracts were awarded to a conglomerate of foreign
firms by  my committee. While awarding these
contracts, we have taken time to deliberately over
invoice one of them to the tune of $31.8m ( Thirty
one million, eight hundred thousand dollars)
What we did was to in addition to the original
contract sum, revaluate and approve this amount
separately and it is presently lying idle in a
suspense account with our apex bank here in Nigeria.
This amount by all standard now belongs to us but we
cannot claim it because it has been made to appear in
the ledger as belonging to a foreign contractor. What
we desire at this moment is to have this funds
transferred into a foreign account but being civil
servants who are still in active government service,
we are barred from maintaining bank accounts overseas.
Thus we have decided to solicit your assistance with a
view to going into a joint partnership to get this
fund out from the bank. At this juncture, we want you
to provide us with a bank account where this fund can
be transferred into first and thereafter, we would
come over to your country to take possession of our
share where we hope to invest part in profitable
ventures with you as our adviser. We would like to
inform you that the nature of your business or
profession at this point is immaterial  because in all
over the world, bigger firms after bidding for and
winning some contract especially in a third world
economy like ours, do subcontract part or whole of the
contract to other firms for execution. It could also
be carried out in any capacity as an individual. So,
you or your organization, having the status of a
subcontractor , with proper documentation, can file an
application for the payment of this fund in your name
and into your bank account. We have agreed in
principle to share this fund in these ratio: 74.5%
will be for my colleagues and I, 25% will be given to
you for your assistance and .5% has been earmarked to
take care of any expenses during the course of this
transaction. All modality for the smooth transfer of
this fund has been worked out and it meets all legal
and administrative requirement in Nigeria as
applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past.
If your response is in the affirmative, within a
period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund
would have been confirmed and transferred into your
account. We have taken the risk aspect of it into
consideration and I want to assure you that it is
actually risk free as the contract will be re-awarded
in your name before the application will be made. We
will follow the procedures systematically with
flawless documentation. This is authentic.
If you feel you will be of assistance and a
beneficiary from this largesse,kindly send a reply to
this mail to that effect and I will oblige you with
more information as to the smooth take off and
conclusion of this once in a lifetime
opportunity.Thanks.Your sincerely,
Dr.Dandyson Openam.

"hotel in Positano","Hey gang,

I just wanted you to know that I sent a fax early this week to cancel our hotel in Positano (Hotel Marincanto).  I did not receive a confirmation back from them, so I called them this morning.  Julio is the gentleman I talked to and he did inform me that the four rooms we had booked are cancelled.  I think we are OK, but I would feel better if we had written confirmation of the cancellation.  Please watch your credit card charges to ensure that you do not get billed for the hotel.

I have received written confirmation from the hotel in Rome (front end of trip) and the hotel in Florence of our cancellation.

Let's start looking at dates in 2002 to rebook this trip.  If one of you has some time, would you check to see if the weather would be better in May or June? Any thoughts? 

Thanks, Kim.

electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public
Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring
competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and
more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy
suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.

        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April
1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster
for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.
Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable
concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity
industry. 

        Although a few states have decided, based on the California
experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.
Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are
that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for
California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and
prices affect market outcomes.

        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity
regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred
beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance
to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity
industry. This section makes several points: 

*	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new
generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned
to meet growing loads. 

*	Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural
gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,
maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large
regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. 

*	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and
voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale
markets). 

*	Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with
artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to
offer retail services without favoring individual competitors. 

*	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply
and price risks. 

*	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,
ancillary services, and transmission congestion. 

*	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and
vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and
transmission). 


        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and
prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer
efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve
reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing
options. 

        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is
turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because
electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is
our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy
to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a
real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the
same time. 

        Although the problems that have occurred in California are
substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should
focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and
accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to
recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond
the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and
wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to
have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces
time varying prices. 

        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for
wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will
enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and
price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability
services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,
and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants
will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.

	In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

	This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

Planning has discussed the possibility with Field Operations and have determined that TW could not justify converting all or part of either station to electric motor drive.  The total number of run hours in 2001 was about 700.  Most of that was at one station which would equate to less than a month total.  Concept was good but bad timing on location based on run hours.  I'm assuming you will pass this on to John Davis to break the bad news to him.  I'll do so if you want just let me know.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Subject:	Summary of NOI


Attached is an executive summary of the NOI on Electronic Service of Documents, RM01-11. Essentially, FERC wants to expand service electronically to allow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for interventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings. FERC is making two proposals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals for a cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics).

Comments are due November 2. Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for our pipelines. Let me know who you wish to participate.

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

To achieve this effort, the luncheon will be moved to a date and time which does not conflict with activities within ETS.

Subject: 

On 01/04/02, M Kester, S Dernovich & R Aragon met with Bryan Dils and Jack Gasten (both Senior O & M Technicians) of Transwestern.

The TW reps agreed that the best method to accomplish the Blanco interconnect would be for TW to tap its existing 30 inch (formerly NWPL Ignacio-Blanco) pipeline that is running N-S approx 120 lf east of the proposed S Trails Blanco Meter site.

To accomplish the tie in would then require about 120 lf of 20 inch (or perhaps 12 inch) pipeline, parallel to the right of way corridor that Questar has already acquired from TW for the extension to WFS Milagro.

The custody transfer meter facilities and any control facilities would then be installed on the Questar site.

TW stated that pressure ranges between 928 to 950 psig in this  30 inch pipeline.

Agreement needs to be finalized on who installs the tap, pipeline tie in, and meter facilities.    It would be good if TW would agree that Questar could accomplish all work, with the exception of the tap of the 30 inch pipeline.

In any event, S Trails needs to contribute our meter parcel site for the location for meter facilities, whether TW or Questar installes these facilities.  

The TW reps were going to convey this info to Ron Mathews of TW.   Conceptually, this location is as shown on the TW dwg, dated 11-26-01, prepared by RLM.

The Questar group is also determining how the parcel size can be expanded, from the current 75 by 100 to about 100 by 125, to accomodate all these facilities.   Paragon's rep is negotiating parcel acquisition with El Paso for this site.

Steve - In response to your previous questions regarding customers behind SWG.  SWG's largest customers are power plants.

	Nevada Power (still owns generation)
	El Dorado (Reliant and Sempra)
	Nevada Cogen Assoc. (NCA1 & 2) (partially owned by Texaco)
	Saguro Power Plant (NRG partially owns)
	Las Vegas Cogen (Enron involved?)
	
Parties who are either planning to build new power plants or are already building power plants in the Southern Nevada area include
Mirant
Reliant
Calpine
PG&E

APS/Pinnacle West was among the buyers of one of Nevada Power's plants before dereg in NV was postponed.

Please let me know if you need other info.

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

	Phil I just got off the phone with Arnold and we have been advised that in the morning around 5 o'clock eastern time is the earliest that Alstrom will have information for us. From talking with Arnold, Alstrom has to get permission from England before they can give us approval to pull the unit. Since the unit is still under warranty we'll need to wait on directions from Alstrom. The team is doing more testing with Alstrom during this time to try and figure out how much damage the unit has.

	We do have Norm Spalding's group lining up a contractor to assist in pulling the unit and transporting it for us. I'll keep everyone undated as soon as we get more information.

	Thanks

	Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

	Thanks

	Amount:	$7.36
	Check Date:  	December 17, 2001
	Invoice Date:	1-1-2001	#676-3004-0

Mika's phone number is (505)396-8534.

Can you please track this down and tell me or Mika how to apply this money.

Many thanks,

Subject:	NYMEX Technical Update

In yesterday's memo to you, I mentioned that the long-term trend has shifted from down to bottoming, with a good chance for wider trading ranges and a greater chance for volatility to the upside increasing. During this period, the primary issue now is neither a support or resistance point, but instead how much time passes without making a new low.  In a macro sense, the more time prompt continuation spends without a break below the 2.881 low, the more unlikely we'll see a breakdown to new lows.  What this means is that time appears to be on the side of the bulls and not the bears.

Here's the market structure:

5.640	If we get a decisive break > 3.880, then 5.640 is minimum implied long term upside target (.382 correction of 10.100 to 2.881) 

4.490	Highest price still consistent with bear market correction.  Any reversal lower from 4.490 targets the potential for a decline to 	2.510.

3.880	If prices trade > 3.880, then most bearish scenario is greatly minimized.


3.290	Current prompt continuation price 

	
3.040	If 2.881 is a major long term low, then prices must not close < 3.040 or trade < 2.990 (.7862 and .852 of 2.881 to 3.620)	
2.990	
 

2.510	


2.170	Most bearish scenario



For Elliott Wave followers, here's the revised count which shows how the numbers above are derived:

10.100 to 5.615		<I> down

  5.615 to 7.100		<II> up

  7.100 to 2.881		<III> down

  2.881 to ?????		<IV> up
			4.490 = .382 retracement; if 4.490 is top of <IV>, then <I> = <V> implies 2.510 as end of <V> down.
			3.880 = .236 retracement; if 3.830 is top of <IV>, then <I> = <V> implies 2.170 as end of <V> down.

Call if you have questions. LP

Randy,

Listed below are some companies/individuals we have used in the past to provide translation services.  The first two would be the preferred.

CD Language Solutions, 713-661-9553, email: languagesolutions@prodigy.net

mellis.sanford@enron.com (can't find her number); she teaches Spanish at Enron

interlingua - Muriel Dupont # 713-957-2040

Carlos Varela #281-646-9754 (phone and fax), email is:  cvarela7@yahoo.com

If you are interested in using one these options I suggest we get a price quote first.  Since these people are scattered about in Houston, they like to do things over email if files are electronically available.  If not, I recommend using a courier service - such as City Central at 713-623-0303 (never had a problem with them).

If you have any questions or need any additional information please let me know.

Jeff

Mark,

After Earl met with Questar on last Wednesday Feb-20 my understanding is that:

1): TW will build all the necessary interconnect facilities and that Questar is responsible for total costs.

2):	In-service date is May-1 and that could be sooner if Questar will support us in purchasing materials

3): You have revised the agreement and it is based on the above term/ conditions

4): Earl has revised the Work.Order for routing and it is based on the above.


Am I correct on 1,2,3 and 4 ?

Thanks, Mansoor

"FW: NGPL - Gray Interconnect","Lorraine,

Would you please have a conversation with KMI about Randy's concern of KMI shutting in the Gray I/C w/o notifying us and the problems it would cause at P-3.  Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.

Thanks, Kim.

Subject:	NGPL - Gray Interconnect

I've just been included in some discussion about this interconnect.  Apparently Kinder-Morgan wants to put a control valve downstream of our measurement point.  They want to do this to have some control of deliveries off TW onto their system.  They have some concern about over-deliveries.  I understand that this happened on a couple of occassions in the past (possibly due to a malfunction with our valve).  They assure us that this control valve is only to provide them with the protection against over delivery.
It would be set to flow at a rate equal to their nomination, I guess.  
As I said, they intend to set this valve downstream of measurement, on their pipe.  Since it will be installed on their pipe, I don't think there's much we can do about it.
However, we were wondering if there can be some wording or agreement formalized that says they would not shut this point in before contacting our field personnel and/or gas control.  I don't think this is their intention, but if they did shut in without notification, it would cause problems at our P-3 station.
We've tried to talk them out of this installation, but they seem adamant to proceed.
I wasn't sure who to contact about this.  Could you let me know if this is a major concern with marketing and scheduling?
Thanks

Subject:	FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles ""window"" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.  

	Thanks. Lynn

"RE: Mavrix:  ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE","Drew,

If TW cannot sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days, then will TW then take the financial risk after this time and not hold Mavrix responsible for the difference? This may be OK as we may wish to re-sell the capacity in different packages of time.   KW.

Subject:	Mavrix:  ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation contracts.  Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue shortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer at the same or better rate within 60 days.  I believe this approach allows TW to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financial risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release them from their contract obligations without penalty.  

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance that a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came from.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that  ""capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons including contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity.""  If the questioning customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, the confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants more detail, is that ""Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business and terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract termination subject to an indemnity or ""keep whole"" mechanism."" 

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow up on this later today.  DF

"RE: Question","Mary,

You are going to have such a great time!  Yes, you will need a mixture of both long and short sleeves.  You might be able to take one pair of shorts, otherwise, jeans or other long pants will be the preferred leg coverings.  A sweatshirt and jacket will be just fine.  Is your jacket water wary?  Tennis shoes are definitely OK!

You will love the Tattoo and Edinburgh.  Find the Fringe Festival Schedule as soon as you get into town.  Look through the book and select a few events that look interesting to you and buy a ticket (there are signs everywhere or ask someone where the ticket offices are - there are several in town).  Entertainers all over the world come to the festival to get their start.  Some of the names you will probably recognize....they got their start there!

Call me when you get back.  I'd love to hear all about your trip!

Hugs back at you, Kim.

Howdy Miss Kim,

How's your summer going?  It has been as hot here as there!!!!  We have been
in the high 90's with humidity to match.

What type of clothing did you take to Scotland?  We are planning on going
everywhere and it looks like the further north you go the cooler it gets.
Would a mix of long and short sleeve shirts be good?  Thought we would bring
a sweatshirt, jacket with hood and umbrella.  Do people wear tennis shoes
and jeans?

We leave August 6th and can hardly wait!  Have reservations for the Tattoo
and two nights booked in Edinburgh.  The travel agent didn't feel we would
have any problem finding a B&B along the way.

Thanks for the advice!

Hugs,

M

"FW: secret anniversary trip","Bill,
 
To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.
 
Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .
 
I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.
 
Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
 
Keep us posted.  
 
Kim.

Gosh, that sounds great!
 
It's been more than 5 years since we've been to NYC, but here's what I'd do...this weekend, look around BR (that's Baton Rouge) for the Sunday issue of the New York Times.  Look in the Lifestyle section (or the NYT equivalent) and you'll undoubtedly see ads for weekend specials and/or package deals to the city, possibly including airfare, hotel, theater tickets, meals, airport transfers, etc.
 
Other than that, you can check out the Marriott Marquis Hotel, which has its own theater and may offer special weekend rates.  Don't gasp when you find out that a room is going to run you $200/night ++, that's just the going rate for a very expensive city.
 
You'll need to visit the TKTS booth in Times Square, where folks queue up mid-morning for half-priced same-day tickets to some great shows...and some real dogs.  You won't find any Producers tickets there, unfortunately, but Rent may be available.  See Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables, for sure.
 
Grab lunch at the Carnegie Deli, but don't fall on the floor when you order the $18 reuben sandwich.  Pay the $3 split fee and share it with Teri.  Note the huge desserts and the terse wait staff.
 
See if the Rainbow Room is still open for dinner and dancing.  Kim and I celebrated our 10th anniversary there with Mike & Cheryl Pope (it was Cheryl's 40th BD, too).  The Rainbow Room is in Rockefeller Center (where NBC is located).
 
Everything is going to be expensive, so get used to it.
 
Let me know what you decide!
 
BTW, how's Poppy?  Mom said he's made an amazing comeback from the brink...

Any ideas as to which play we can get tickets to at this late date?  Rent is still available and I've heard good things about it.

How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?

  Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required,  In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01.  Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding.  In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process.  If this isn't clear, please call    MK

Mansoor and I met on this topic this morning.  We are confirming with Perry Frazier what, if any, firm commitments we may have on this system to make sure we understand possible impacts of abandoning this station.  Also, we will meet with the regulatory folks this week to discuss the various regulatory options with them.  We will keep you updated as we progress through these meetings.  

How much money is required on the Ivanhoe station to keep ESD compliant?

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.

Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.

Are you comfortable with us taking the Lexus?  Gary has offered to let us

Subject:	RE: Installation of Pigging Facilities

Thanks for everyone's help on this and I apologize for being so late in answering back . We've been on team reviews for the last couple of weeks, doing reviews during the day and traveling to next location. I agree that we should approach them from the Special Service side. At this time we have our yearly meeting set up for Nov. 12th but this could change. Todd Stubbs is ready but Bob Checketts is having problems scheduling this week. He's tied up on a security task force for their company. Todd should let me know this week if we're still on for the 12th.  Lindy do you or someone else plan to attend the meeting? If not I'll plan to visit with Todd and see how he reacts to the facility upgrade if that's OK with everyone. I'm still not sure if we plan to do this next year but will find out this week and let you know.

Normally we have our meeting by September 1st but NW was setting it up this year and November was targeted for a meeting. I'll give you a call on Monday and we can discuss. Do you think we need a conference call to discuss?

Thanks
RJ

I agree with using your Special Services assessment. It's not an expansion as there is no increase in certificated capacity. So nothing ventured, nothing gained.

Subject:	Installation of Pigging Facilities

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles ""window"" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 6, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   I know that lists like the following pop up now and again on the
internet. This one, sent to me by George Leyendecker, has some fresh
ones -

   1. The best way to get even is to forget.
   2. Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.
   3. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts.
   4. Some folks wear their halos much too tight.
   5. Some marriages are made in heaven, but they ALL have to be
maintained on earth.
   6. Unless you can create the WHOLE universe in 5 days, then perhaps
giving ""advice"" to God, isn't such a good idea!
   7. Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks up.
   8. Standing in the middle of the road is dangerous. You will get
knocked down by the traffic from both ways.
   9. Words are windows to the heart.
  10. A skeptic is a person who when he sees the handwriting on the
wall, claims it's a forgery.
  11. It isn't difficult to make a mountain out of a molehill just add
a little dirt.
  12. A successful marriage isn't finding the right person, it's being
the right person.
  13. The mighty oak tree was once a little nut that held its ground.
  14. Too many people offer God prayers, with claw marks all over them.
  15. The tongue must be heavy indeed, because so few people can hold
it.
  16. To forgive is to set the prisoner free, and then discover the
prisoner was you.
  17. You have to wonder about humans, they think God is dead and Elvis
is alive!
  18. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just
be sure to flush when you are done.
  19. You'll notice that a turtle only makes progress when it sticks
out its neck.
  20. If the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, you can
bet the water bill is higher.
  21. You are richer today if you have laughed, given, and forgiven.

   These are pithy sentences that can cause us to laugh and to think.

   There is another phrase I use in our work from time to time. It is -

   Having a heart as light as a feather.

   What does that mean?
    Is it possible?
     If it is, what keeps us from experiencing it more?

   These are some of the questions I want to talk with you about when
we gather this Sunday. I invite you -
   to be present,
    to bring your heart,
     to be prepared to lay aside some of your burdens, and
      to dare to open some doors to new life.

   My heart is hoping to see you Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

Subject:	RE: San Juan Pigging/DRA

I am attaching a profile of the efficiencies between Bloomfield and Bisti for Feb 22-
March 11.

 
Summary
1)	Before pigging, (i.e. 21-27th), the efficiency was about 96.5%
2)	After the pig run on the 27th, the efficiency increased to about 102% for two days.
3)	It averaged about 101% for the next 6 days (i.e. 28th-5th March).  
4)	It then steadily plummeted to 98% over a 3-day period - a percent degradation a day! (5th-8th March)
5)	It remains around the 98% average today.

Essentially, the high efficiency resulting from the 27th Feb pigging lasted just about a week.
The targeted efficiency for this section is 103%.

At the TW commercial meeting this afternoon, we indicated that applying the DRA around the end of May (together with other planned outages) may be the way to go. Meanwhile,  I believe we should schedule another pig run as soon as we can. 
I did also receive the sample collected from the last pig run. I will have it analyzed and report on our findings.

Please let me know any thoughts you may have on this issue

Hi Debbie,

Can you tell me who you have talked to?  Michelle is the Oneok rep and is out of town until Monday.  I will ask Michelle to assist you in this collection.  

Michelle, would you please coordinate with Deb and see if you can find the right person a Oneok for us to talk to regarding the AR issue. 

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, 

There are some outstanding AR issues regarding ftps for Westar/KN/Oneok.  I've tried to contact them and talked to 4 different people with no avail.  The last person said he's not so sure that they are valid.  I've got to locate the contract and send to him.  I believe I'm going to need marketing assistance in collecting.  Can you tell me who I need to talk with.

Debbie

Kim

The in-service date of May 1, will be very difficult to attain. Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other). These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect. Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations. 
The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP. 
We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002. 
If you have questions or issues, please let me know.


Thanks

Earl,

We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.

Thanks, Kim.

All,

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a ""Payment Plan"" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.  

We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.  After execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.

Thanks, 
Kim    713-853-3098

Subject:	Air Permit Delay, Red Rock Expansion

Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a ""permit"" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their ""ducks in a row"" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
agreement,
etc.

Kirk

How's your summer going?  It has been as hot here as there!!!!  We have been
in the high 90's with humidity to match.

What type of clothing did you take to Scotland?  We are planning on going
everywhere and it looks like the further north you go the cooler it gets.
Would a mix of long and short sleeve shirts be good?  Thought we would bring
a sweatshirt, jacket with hood and umbrella.  Do people wear tennis shoes
and jeans?

We leave August 6th and can hardly wait!  Have reservations for the Tattoo
and two nights booked in Edinburgh.  The travel agent didn't feel we would
have any problem finding a B&B along the way.

Thanks for the advice!

The RMS work orders show a total of $105,622 actually billed to TW. The budgeted amount was $690,510. The work orders never were allocated with the actual costs, so majority of the actual costs are still showing up on NNG's books.

	As a note for the  ""cc"" list above: the TW VaR has decreased (From over $1million to $600,000) for unexplained 
	reasons and is believed to be related to the volatility calculation which is done by NNG Marketing using SAS
	(Statistical Analysis Software) as input into Caminus.  We have talked to Richard Riehm in Marketing and he
	is looking into the problem but is not sure what's causing these unusual swings.  The Daily Risk report has not been 	distributed for the last few days pending resolution of this calculation problem but the correct VaR is still believed
	to be over the ETS VaR limit.

	We are scheduled to meet with Stan tomorrow, at his request of Vince, to discuss the TW VaR.  I know Tracy
	and Vince has had some discussions related to the VaR calculation and that Tracy has discussed TW Marketing's
	plans to reduce the VaR.  I'm assuming Tracy will ""facilitate"" the meeting tomorrow and I suggest we use the last 
	VaR calculation 	we believe to be correct for discussion purposes which was as of February 4 data (Total VaR - $1.152mm).

I think that the problem with the TW VaR is how the volatility is being calculated on the San Juan indices for the months of November 2002 through March 2003.  This is not a Caminus issue, but an issue of how the volatility is being calculated outside Caminus.  It sounded as though Jose will not work on any issue related to Caminus, but I think this issue is outside of Caminus

Dear Sir,

RE URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL

It is humble pleasure to write you this letter
irrespective of the fact that you don't know me.
neither have we seen before. However, I got your
contact through a trade somnal in my earest, search
for a reliable and trust worthy individual that can
handle this confidential business.

I am Dr. Benneth C. Micheal, the manager of United
bank for Africaplc (U.B.A)Agege/Ijaye-Ogba Branch,
Lagos-Nigeria. I am writng in respect of a foreign
customer in my branch, who was working with one of the
government parastatal as a contractor, he was the
owner of the No 0140351577400
ID No470089 swift code No:23TUBA, he has in this
account in my branch the sum of US$ 65 Million 
(sixty five millionU.S Dollars) before he died in a
plane crash {ETHIOPIAN AIRLINE 961) four years ago
with the hole passengers aboard perished.

Since, the demise of this on customer, i have been
wateling with keen interest to see the next of kin but
all has proved abortive, for no one has ever come to
claim his fund. Having noticed this, immediatly i
covered up the account, now want you (being a
foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next kin and
forward your account and other relevant document to be
advised to you by the bank to attest to the claim, as
the banking ethies here does not allow such money to
stay more than four years after which the money will
be recalled to the bank treasury asd unclaimed nafter
this year 1/3 quater auditing.

So, I decided to contact you to seek for your help and
assistance to use your name as the next of kin to the
deceased. I am wiling to give to you a hole total of
40% of the total sum, upon the reciept of your
personal response, I will than send to you via fax or
email to you the application, which you will fill and
send back to the bank applying as the next of kin, for
the immediate realasing of the fund to you. Along with
the bank fax No and the next step to take.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
business is hitch free and that you should not
entertain any fear as all modalites for the realise of
this fund wil be finalized with in ten working days to
get the fund retrieved successfully from the day you
apply to the bank as a reletion to the deceased.

Please you are required to corresponde only via e-mail
till the end of this transaction for the security and
confidenciality reasons of this business please. Also
signify your decission including your e-mail address.

Respectfully submitted,

Dr. Benneth C. Michael.

The CPUC is protesting the revised tariff sheets filed Oct. 31.

In a nutshell, the CPUC argues ""the fundamental issue that should be investigated  is whether the maximum recourse rate is in fact functioning as the FERC intended to assure fair and reasonable use of negotiated rates by a pipeline with market power.""

No magic to the 9%.  We could use any reasonable rate as long as we are conceptually consistent in future situations.  I.e.,  we could use the FERC interest rate here if we were willing to always use it in contract termination situations.  Or, if we use a rate here that is X basis points over some generally accepted benchmark (FERC interest rate? prime?  LIBOR?) we'd have a tough time justifying use of a significantly different mechanism (even though the actual rate in the subsequent deal might be a lot different due to interest rate movement).  df

We should give Maverix the option of paying the discounted sum up front or doing a keep whole payment each month of the transaction.    I like the 9% discount rate for Maverix but would not be happy with such from an outsider.    Is there a basis in the 9% rate?

I believe this approach allows TW to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financial risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release them from their contract obligations without penalty.  

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance that a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came from.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that  ""capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons including contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity.""  If the questioning customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, the confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants more detail, is that ""Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business and terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract termination subject to an indemnity or ""keep whole"" mechanism."" 

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow up on this later today.  DF

Presidential Task Force on Oil
spillage,DepartmentofPetroleum Resources,
Victoria Island,Lagos Nigeria.BUSINESS PROPOSAL
WORTH$31.8 MILLION DOLLARS
STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL  Dear Sir/Madam,
This proposal is coming to you with the ardent belief
that you will take advantage of our goodwill and out
of our desperation to have a trusted foreign partner
whom we can entrust our funds with for safekeeping.
This is not a fairy tale but for real. I am
Dr.Igho Richard, the secretary to the
PresidentialTaskforce on
Oil spillage in my country. We are the 6th largest
producer of crude oil in the world and more often than
not, we always experience oil spillage in the Niger
Delta region of my country. These spillage causes a
lot of havoc to inhabitants of the community and hence
contracts are awarded especially to foreign firms to
clean and mop up the spilled crude oil from the areas
affected. The spillage sometimes cover several
kilometres and the value of contract also runs into
millions of dollars. Between 1999 to 2000, some
contracts were awarded to a conglomerate of foreign
firms by  my committee. While awarding these
contracts, we have taken time to deliberately over
invoice one of them to the tune of $31.8m ( Thirty
one million, eight hundred thousand dollars)
What we did was to in addition to the original
contract sum, revaluate and approve this amount
separately and it is presently lying idle in a
suspense account with our apex bank here in Nigeria.
This amount by all standard now belongs to us but we
cannot claim it because it has been made to appear in
the ledger as belonging to a foreign contractor. What
we desire at this moment is to have this funds
transferred into a foreign account but being civil
servants who are still in active government service,
we are barred from maintaining bank accounts overseas.
Thus we have decided to solicit your assistance with a
view to going into a joint partnership to get this
fund out from the bank. At this juncture, we want you
to provide us with a bank account where this fund can
be transferred into first and thereafter, we would
come over to your country to take possession of our
share where we hope to invest part in profitable
ventures with you as our adviser. We would like to
inform you that the nature of your business or
profession at this point is immaterial  because in all
over the world, bigger firms after bidding for and
winning some contract especially in a third world
economy like ours, do subcontract part or whole of the
contract to other firms for execution. It could also
be carried out in any capacity as an individual. So,
you or your organization, having the status of a
subcontractor , with proper documentation, can file an
application for the payment of this fund in your name
and into your bank account. We have agreed in
principle to share this fund in these ratio: 74.5%
will be for my colleagues and I, 25% will be given to
you for your assistance and .5% has been earmarked to
take care of any expenses during the course of this
transaction. All modality for the smooth transfer of
this fund has been worked out and it meets all legal
and administrative requirement in Nigeria as
applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past.
If your response is in the affirmative, within a
period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund
would have been confirmed and transferred into your
account. We have taken the risk aspect of it into
consideration and I want to assure you that it is
actually risk free as the contract will be re-awarded
in your name before the application will be made. We
will follow the procedures systematically with
flawless documentation. This is authentic.
If you feel you will be of assistance and a
beneficiary from this largesse,kindly send a reply to
this mail to that effect and I will oblige you with
more information as to the smooth take off and
conclusion of this once in a
lifetimeopportunity.Thanks.Your sincerely,
Dr.Igho Richard.

Kim, 

Those ideas sounded pretty good.  I got a list of places from Lisa also: 

Benjy's (on Dunstan by Ballys) 
Raven Grill (Bissonett) 
Goode Company Seafood 
Sierra Grill 
Floridita Seafood Grill (the place on Kirby/Richmond) 
Tony Mandola's Seafood River Oaks 

Any of these sound good to us.  I think Lisa's preference is to avoid ""heavy"" places, and go for either a place with variety or something that's more seafood oriented.  However, we're flexible.  By the way, 6:00 p.m. sounds perfect.

Whatdaya think?

Subject:	FW: Transwestern's Reporting Requirements under FERC Order on Reporting CA gas sales

In preparation of the new reporting requirements mandated by FERC, there are a couple of items under Question 1 that we need to decide on regarding the method of data retrieval.  These are:

	b.  the terms and effective date of the contract
	h.  the rate charged in $$/MMbtu

Rick - Currently, the effective or execution date is not captured anywhere.  I will need someone (on of the Alma's or Josh) to extract all TW contracts and populate this info onto a spreadsheed.  Prospectively, this info will also need to be captured with each new contract.  

Kim - With regard to the rate charged, I am concerned with how the information will be captured and stored.  It's virtually impossible to use the current CBS rate system because at the end of the month, there is a great possibility that these FT rates to the Cal border will be buried into a calculated, blended rate (due to capturing incremental fees for alternate point usage).  Also as I mentioned in a previous e-mail to TK, we need to ensure that the IT rates are updated in the rate system promptly.

Don - After your initial review of the data request, did you have any other concerns regarding data retrieval and automation of the process?  I will need to do some investigation regarding what it might take to add some additional fields/identifiers.

Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Per the Commission's order yesterday, Transwestern will be required to submit daily transportation activity (nominated, scheduled & delivered), capacity release activity and capacity beginning August 1, 2001.  The information will be submitted 30 days after the close of a month -- meaning that our first report will be due September 30.  The order does not specify when the historical capacity information for May 1999 and May 2000 needs to be submitted -- so at this point I'm assuming that it will submitted with the first report.

I would like to have a brief get-together tomorrow at 10:30 AM (Ricki will follow with details) just to make certain that we head into the month collecting all the information we need to be compliant.  In particular, now that we will have to report nominated vs. scheduled to the Cal. border each day -- I have an even heightened concern that we head into the month making sure that we capture the SoCal Window number each day.

Subject:	FW: SCG Advice 2837-A

After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the ""direction"" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.

Elizabeth

Alicia, thanks for your patience as we attempt to acquire meeting space for our team.

Marian Salinas, who keeps the schedule for the team rooms on the 39th floor,  noted there was a conflict only on Wednesday mornings.  Ben Asante and Leigh Ann Foret have graciously agreed to release this Wednesday morning slot for our team.  The Facility Planning/Optimization team will now meet in ECN 3998 for there weekly meetings held on Wednesdays from 8:00 - 9:00a.  

I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your assistance in making things happen for the TW Commercial Team.  We look forward to our upcoming move to the 39th floor on next week.

All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay ""along the way"" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.


Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

Mansoor:

In response to your request about any Firm contracts on the 8"" line between Atoka # 3 & #1.  There are 3 contracts using the 12"" and 8"" common lines, one is a Socal contract # 8255 at Rio Pecos for 6000 mmcf and an Agave contract # 26490 for 800 mmcf.  The third is an Agave contract # 27377 for March 2002 only.  I would suggest changing the contract primary points to something other than Rio Pecos.  The Socal volumes have been delivered, for sometime,  at the Discharge of Atoka #1.  The Aid State POI has been where this Socal gas has flowed.

Mike & Cheryl -

We heard yesterday about Cheryl's illness.  You guys have been such special
friends to us, we both wanted to know if there was anything we could do to
help.

If Cheryl is going to be going down to MD Anderson for treatment, either on
an outpatient or inpatient basis, consider this:  our house is less than a
ten-minute walk from MD Anderson.  We have a spare bedroom and free parking.
If it works out that Mike drops Cheryl off and needs a place to stay, either
overnight or periodically during the day, we'll leave a key at the front
desk of the Spires and one (or both) of you can base out of our place.

And if you need someone to take care of the menagerie up north, I'm sure we
can figure out how to get that done while you're staying down south.
Remember that I make the reverse commute up there every day, and you both
have a lot of friends and co-workers that can pitch in to help out.

We think the world of you guys and want to help.  Let us know how we can.

Kim & John

Subject:	SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.

"Southern Trails","Steve,

I just wanted to let you know that I have been playing telephone tag with a couple of the Questar folks.  For the most part, they were out of the office several days during the last two weeks (of course I was out of pocket a couple days, too) .  I've left another message with Gary Schmitt, who apparently is out of town yesterday and today, but I did hear from Mary Kay Olson, who was also in our office when Gary came in several weeks ago.  Mary Kay is tracking down the status of the Western Leg information that Kevin requested.  I also let her know that we are interested in the Eastern Leg as well.  She will begin pulling that information together, too.  I expect to hear from her either later today or tomorrow with a status and timing of the data.  She will also connect up with Gary when she sees him.  I will keep you posted as I hear more information.

Also, Jodi Starley (who is also in the Questar Marketing department), is looking for me to begin the Interconnect Agreement for the San Juan Hub connect with Southern Trails .  Do you have a problem if I begin the paperwork, however, I have several other Interconnect Agreements that are higher priority at this time and it may take a while to get to this one?  I recognize that this is a delicate balance.

Thanks, Kim.

"RE: Lunch today with Frank","Martha,
 
I'm sorry you had to miss lunch today.  Frank also brought Mark Pickering (they worked together at EBS).  Frank and Mark are working on business development for Plains.  He very much wants to catch up with you, I told him you would give him a call.
 
His office number is 713 739-6715  (if 739 doesn't work, try 729, the voice mail was fuzzy).  His cell phone is 713 503-9027 (I know this number is correct).
 
Please give him a call.  He is very happy in his new role.  My lunch with him today did remind me of the ""good ole days"" you and I had with him.  
 
Give me a shout when you get back into the office.  
 
 
Thanks, Kim
 
 
P.S.  We moved up to 39 last weekend.  I finally went through all my boxes from the office you and I shared on 41.  Some of the stuff was yours, so I packed you one box and put it on your desk.  (Sorry.......)  Call me.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================

PREVIEW for March 3, 2002

======================================================

Dear Folks -

   I hope you have been allowing the story of One/Two Man to work its magic
on you. It is a most wonderful story.

   But what in the world - either the outer or inner world - does such a
story have to do with us? And those various animals who helped One/Two Man
in his task? Especially the snake?

   When we gather this week, as promised, I'll give you some ideas about
what this story means. What I'm mostly interested in is how we can use this
story and others like it - and there are many - for our own movement toward
freedom and love.

   I also want to connect this story to that primal Judeo-Christian story of
the exodus.

   I hope to see you this week as we continue our journey
   from bondage to freedom,
      from darkness to light,
         from death to life.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

========================================

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an
enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.

The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at St.

The legal description for the proposed Southern Trails interconnect north of the Blanco Hub is Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, San Juan County, NM.  This is on the old NWPL receipt line coming off the 30"" Ignacio - Blanco line into the Blanco Hub upstream of the El Paso Blanco measurement.  Bottom line is it's the same place we talked about earlier this week.

Dear IPANM Members:

The Board of Directors of IPANM has invited our state legislators to meet
with us. They have scheduled informal luncheons in Santa Fe, Farmington and
Roswell to provide an opportunity to give the legislators an overview of the
industry and to share our views on current issues.

We strongly urge all Directors and any members who would like to attend to
please feel free to do so. If you decide to attend, it will be necessary for
you to contact the appropriate coordinator listed below in order to give

"RE: 2002 Capital Projects","Ramona,

Gosh, something always seems to come up every year that we want to make a change to our existing systems.  Lindy will be back tomorrow and I will discuss this with her.  We are evaluating how we currently administer and market pools.  If we decide to make a change I suspect that it may require a system change, but it is too early to make a decision just yet. I also think that we should think about how to link EOL transactions through the entire contracting process.  I know that NNG is probably a little further on this than we are, but it is reasonable to think we should have this ready for us next year.  

I will continue to ponder this and discuss this with Lindy upon her return tomorrow. 

Thanks, Kim.

Kim or Lindy,
 Does TW have any items or system enhancements, new services that may be implemented in 2002 that we should budget for?
Can you send me a list. I am not sure how this process works. TW Marketing has specific items they need or plan to implement that relate to CAS, or TMS is fact in your budget or our budget?
If you can think of anything, please send me an email by COB Thursday, 8/2/01.

Subject:	2002 Capital Projects

As everyone knows the 2002 budget planning process is in full swing.  We need to aggressively look at capital projects for 2002.  I have attached the Project Profile Template hat has to be completed and developed for each project.  It looks like we have been given the date of August 10th to get any discretionary project that has to have economic analysis done on to Denis Tu and August 16th is the deadline that I have to turn in all IT capital project request to the Program Office.  I think capital has to go to Rod Hayslett around the following week in August.  As you know, it can take several days to work with Denis so if we have discretionary projects those need to get moving quickly.  We also need to look at GISB and FERC and see if we have anything next year which is non-discretionary.

The Rates & Revenue System is well underway and in good shape, but we don't have much time to pull together remaining projects.  If you all have projects that you are thinking about for next year, please complete the attached description of the project and forward to me no later than August 1st so we can discuss and begin the estimating process.  Let me know if you have any questions or we need to get together to discuss.  Thanks.

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides billing information for July 2001 reservation invoices.  

Please be advised that the PG&E (Core) releases exceeded the maximum tariff rate as summarized below (the first three were special calculations based on index spreads and the last one was a fixed rate):

PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation           60,000/day * 31 days * $0.7081 = $1,317,066.00 
Sempra Energy Trading Corp.                           15,000/day * 31 days * $1.9951 = $   927,721.50 
Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.                                  50,000/day * 31 days * $0.7468 = $1,157,540.00

Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC        25,000/day * 31 days * $1.1600 = $  899,000.00

These amounts will be billed to the acquiring shippers and once payments are received, PG&E will subsequently receive reimbursement.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

 

Thanks,

Elizabeth

Lisa, Steve Harris suggested I share with you our concerns on the subject of ""Shared Drives"".  We had some problems on last week with deleted files on the TW_NNG Shared Drive -""S"".  The Help Desk has resolved these problems, but in the process, we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  

Our concerns are such that some files should be viewed only by ETS, specifically TW.   Would you please check on this concern as soon as possible?

If you would, please update me on the status of this request.  If you have additional questions concerning this problem, please do not hesitate to call me (x35849).

Subject: Power's fine for now


We saw the Pediatric Orthopedist today.  First I must say it was one of the most smoothly run Dr. visits I've been on.  We had an appointment at 1:30 and low and behold we were talking to the Dr. at 1:30!  The Dr. was also very nice.  He answer our questions without being arrogant and he spoke in plain English.   

Basically he said the modern theory was that half of the cases went away on their own, so we have an appointment in 3 months to check on Power  establish a trend line.  In the mean time he's free to do what he wants to but allowed to sit out if his hip bothers him, i.e.  self limiting kind of like my top speed on a bike.  If at 3 months its getting better, we continue the agressive treatment by visiting every 3 months.  If it is not getting better then we look at something more intrusive.  He explained the crutches and braces that used to be the normal treatment were more to slow the boys down than anything else and recent studies had not proven them that effective.  Power is also allowed to take some Motrin or other over the counter pain medication if he wants. 

The Dr. discouraged anything like cross country running, but emphasized keeping the joint exercised was good, so no couch potato.  The Dr. okayed the wheels so bike and skates are back on the menu.  Judy is going to sign him up for the Wednesday swim in the indoor pool at the park in Katy.   

Further updates next January

This is the equipment for the proposed interconnect. The Enron ""e""nternet is down at this time and I will e-mail your the Engineering Standards when it is running. Jim Williams will be here this PM and I will give him a typical I/C package drawing and Material list set that you can review. This is a typical set and for your proposed I/C, a few modifications to package would be required but it is 80% of what is used at most I/C. 

You can develop a cost estimate from this package with your modifications. 

If any questions or if I can be of assistance, please contact me.

The I/C is a 10"" UltraSonic designed for a range of 35 mmcfd to +100 mmcfd. 
By using the US meter, this allows a wide range of volumes without changing out the tube when Agave want to increase the volumes.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

"RE: I heard 3 Italian Maybe's","J,  I don't have a problem committing to Italy and purchasing airfare when it makes $ sense with the thought that we can always cancell just like we did in Sept.  I don't worry too much about having to cancell, but I think a lot will shake out over the next 6-8 weeks here at 1400 Smith.  I'll keep working Dot to see if she and Tom are willing to commit to a spring vs. fall timeframe.  I suspect Janell and Dennis will be no go for anytime in 02.  If Dot and Tom are game then we can talk with D & T and P & J about meeting Jane and Barry to make our party and even 8.  If Dot and Tom are not available to go, I'm more comfortable just making the traveling party a foursome.

I still think we're GO, but I heard Dorothy and Kim do the ""it depends on
Enron"" and Janell has the broken leg issue.  Hopefully it all works out
well.  We're not at the deadline yet but at some point we'll have to make a
call.

The first hurdle is the U of H accelerated Italian course in mid February
which I plan to attend unless we've aborted.  The real deadline is somewhere
around D-30 days when the air fare/schedule becomes harder to get.

All Team Members:  Please try to get your bullet items to Kim for her review no later than 10:00a on Friday mornings.  Kim has an awesome responsibility of getting the bullets to Steve by 11:00a on Friday mornings.

We will need your assistance in obtaining these objectives.  Let's try our best to get items in on time, even if means updating a few items after lunch.

Can you assist me in this effort?  Yes, you can!!!! (smile)

Have a great weekend....

Dear Ms Bastida:
 
    I'm not certain where to direct  this request, so, if contract admin is not the right group, I hope you will  call me or route this request to appropriate group ASAP.
 
    I have some clients (munis in  Southern California) who are interested in tradeable rights on SoCal's system  and possibly obtaining their own transport on TWPL.  
 
    I have an old (1991)  Transwestern system map, and I would like to get an up to date set of  system maps (system & laterals, compressors, delivery points, etc) at your  earliest.
 
    Please do not hesitate to call  me should you wish to discuss this or if there is a charge.
My mailing address & phone (for charges for the  maps or questions) are as follows:

You might want to send these to Kim 

Some brief comments:

1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period of at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiration date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before the expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as this is optionality without any cost to them. 
2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to establish an ""Initial Recourse Rate"" prior to the open season in order for their proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the ""proportionate reduction"" requested. 

We need to get Paul Cherry working on the credit of MGI Supply ASAP.

I have also discussed these comments with Pemex and they do intend on giving us feedback on the rate we offered within the next week.  It is Pemex's intention to move forward with this LOI with an agreed upon rate (even though it currently says ""To Be determined"") prior to execution.  I will keep you posted as we get more information.  If you have any comments regarding any of these issues, please feel free to contact me, otherwise, please look forward to review our next draft prior to us sending it back to Pemex.

Subject:	NYMEX Technical Update

Since December 3rd, we've had a market structure in place that cited 2.960 as a key pivot on the prompt continuation chart; that is, if prices were to close > 2.960, the longer-term market structure would change to a bullish bias breaking out from the range-bound trading we've seen over the last three weeks.

On Tuesday night, December 25th, prompt JAN 02 reached a high of 3.050 during Access and then proceeded to close at 2.911 at the end of the regular pit session on Wednesday, December 26th.  Furthermore, prices continued to erode during last night's Access and closed at 2.775.  Currently, JAN 02 is trading at 2.680 on its expiry, and FEB 02 is trading at 2.700.  

With the inability of the prompt to close > 2.960, and a subsequent sharp drop in prices, it is logical to infer that 3.050 was definitely a short to intermediate term top. What this means is if the move from 3.440 to 2.180 was an A wave down (a 1.260 decline), and the move from 2.180 to 3.050 was the B wave up, then the downside targets (C wave down) are 2.270 (.618 of A=C) and 1.790 (A=C).

In the CPUC's meeting today, the Commission approved the proposed RLS/Peaking tariff which provides for a bypass peaking rate when customers bypass their system except for peaking service.  It appears they approved the June 19th Proposed Decision which establishes a cost based rate made up of four components--Customer Charge, Public Purpose Program charge, Reservation Charge and a volumetric Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge.  As soon as the Order is published I'll review the final Order and advise if this is still true or if any changes were made.  SoCal will have 10 days from the Order to file an Advice Letter with conforming tariff sheets.

Randy,

Listed below are some companies/individuals we have used in the past to provide translation services.  The first two would be the preferred.

CD Language Solutions, 713-661-9553, email: languagesolutions@prodigy.net

mellis.sanford@enron.com (can't find her number); she teaches Spanish at Enron

interlingua - Muriel Dupont # 713-957-2040

Carlos Varela #281-646-9754 (phone and fax), email is:  cvarela7@yahoo.com

If you are interested in using one these options I suggest we get a price quote first.  Since these people are scattered about in Houston, they like to do things over email if files are electronically available.  If not, I recommend using a courier service - such as City Central at 713-623-0303 (never had a problem with them).

If you have any questions or need any additional information please let me know.

Kim,
As we discussed and agreed, we continue to plan on having the Transwestern meter for the new interconnect into Southern Trails located on our property at Blanco.  Will are planning for Transwestern to tie into it's pipeline and extend piping over to our site where the meter will be located.  Transwestern may need to aquire a small length of right-of-way from El Paso that will connect the TW property to the site we are getting from El Paso.  TW personel will have unlimited acess to this site.
We will create a lease agreement to lease the footprint for the meter to TW. 
As we discussed, this facility must be in operation on May1, 2002. 
Thank you for all your help.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
Gaylen

Kevin,

In following up with the Chief Credit Officer ( who is out today ) another person ( Steven Tilley in Credit ) returned my call. He advised they were not impressed with the letter and that Bankruptcy was a possibility. I replied that this is the best that we could offer short of a guarantee and that no one can predict one/two years down the road. I offered our financials which they will send a CA. I believe it would help it you could discuss their issues. I explained that improving their status was not possible, but Tilley continued to pursue. 

I have set a time on Monday at 8:30 CST for us to call Michael Sessa, Chief Credit Officer and Tilley.

Please advise if that will work for your schedule.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of February 3, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   First of all thanks to all of you who responded to the need for
financial help in our medical work in Bolivia. I can't recall
experiencing such generosity. We are going to be able to give them more
than they requested. Plus, several people are already on the list to go
down with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange
getting medical supplies to the clinic. Wow! Thanks.

   The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to ""the
truth"" and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious
and spiritual well being. We have become ""fact fundamentalists."" I also
deal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing
with terrorism. The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from
Ethiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood.

   What follows is a full text of the presentation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Is The Story You're Telling With Your Life the Truth?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist
complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked
how long it took him to catch them.

   ""Not very long,"" answered the Mexican.

   ""But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?"" asked the
American.

   The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet
his needs and those of his family.

   The American asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""

   ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a
siesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my
friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs. I
have a full life.""

   The American interrupted, ""I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help
you!

   ""You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the
extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger
boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a
second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of
trawlers.

   ""Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can negotiate
directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant.
You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los
Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge
enterprise.""

   ""How long would that take?"" asked the Mexican.

   ""Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years,"" replied the American.

   ""And after that?""

   ""Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting,"" answered the
American, laughing. ""When your business gets really big, you can start
selling stocks and make millions!""

   ""Millions? Really? And after that?""

   ""After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near
the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take
a siesta, and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends!""

   Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a
wonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about.

   I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase
""Journey Into Wholeness."" It is so easy for those of us in the West to
think that that journey is out there somewhere, in the outer world. The
goal of spiritual work is to become a ""self."" Or, to become aware of
the Self. I can't adequately explain to you what this self is. It is
the center and, at the same time, the circumference of the personality.
It embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness. The Self is known
as the Christ in Christianity.

   Journey into Wholeness. The root meaning of the word ""holiness"" is
this wholeness. Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the
faculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a
dignified place in our personality. Usually for those of us in the
Western world our need, as reflected in the story of the Mexican
fisherman, is relatedness; relatedness to ourselves as well as to
others. This is the principle of equality I've spoken to you about so
often. We who speak English are limited to one word for ""love."" In
Sanskrit there are ninety-six words for love. We are highly specialized
in technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings.

   Jesus, and other Eastern spiritual teachers, saw the outer world to
be of little importance. The place where the kingdom of God was was
inside and among us. For us, however, reality is in the outer,
material, physical world. One of the ways this has affected Christian
theology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique, so
distinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death.
The religion out of which we came, Judaism, thought that after death
what happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the
sunrise. Yes, it has individuality while it exists as a separate
entity, but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great
primal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality. Does a drop of
water cease to exist when it falls back into the sea? Well, yes and no.
Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more. Jesus knew that the
ego was a great troublemaker for us.

   We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals. To
threaten this notion of who we are is hell. We protect what we call our
individuality at all costs. Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed
a life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual
human life.

   You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our
lives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do. Those
were the questions that shaped, by the way, what became our Bible.
After every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the
questions: Who are we and what are we to do?

   e.e. cummings once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is doing
its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle
any human being can fight, and never stop fighting.""

   I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into, let us
say, a Methodist church. During the sermon, the visitor got so excited
that whenever the preacher made a point, the Pentecostal man would
scream out, ""Praise God!"" or ""Hallelujah!"" or ""Amen!"" The ushers were
so distraught about the Pentecostal's behavior that the head usher went
down the aisle and whispered to him: ""You'll have to keep quiet? The
pastor's right in the middle of the sermon!"" The Pentecostal man said,
""Keep quiet? How can I keep quiet? I've got the Holy Spirit!"" To which
the usher said, ""Well, you didn't get it in this church!""

   The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make.
You see, he didn't have the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit had him! And
that's the problem with much of our theology. We wish he had the Holy
Spirit. There's a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit
in the nice, neat, tidy confines of our categories and barriers. We'd
like to put God in a box.

   Get this: Nobody has the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit always has us
and, given our Western orientation, that scares us so that we resist
and repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails. We want
a God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable
and controllable. We want a religion that is safe. A journey that is
predictable. There is no true spiritual journey that is that way.

   We modern people have been victimized by own modernity. Of course,
we've benefited - we have the sciences, technology, modern medicine,
even emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things.
But it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and
spiritual life.

   For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality.
If God can't be proved by modern means, then God must not be.

   Second, modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality -
with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts. Modern
Western culture is the only culture in human history that has
identified truth with factuality. We are, as Marcus Borg calls us,
""fact fundamentalists."" If a statement isn't scientifically or
historically factual, it isn't true. These two things are serious
mistakes and deadly to the journey inward.

   Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact
fundamentalists. Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire.
Conservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true
at all. This is why they emphasize the literal and historical
factuality of biblical texts. They both agree - facts are what matters.

   If I had a magic wand that worked, one of the things I would do is
to get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of
these positions are.

   What we've got when it comes to having faith today for most people
is whether they can believe ""iffy"" things or not. That, to most people,
is what Christianity has become. It is as if what God wants most from
us is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true.
And, if you can't believe them, then you don't ""have faith"" and
probably aren't a Christian.

   Listen carefully: Faith has to do with your relation to God, to
Self. Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not.

   I'm going to come back to this in the weeks ahead.

   Let me see if I can give you an example. One of the questions that
has persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what
Jesus' view on violence might be. This has been raised since the events
of 9/11. What would Jesus have us do? Does professing to be Christian
mean trying to live as Christ might live? And if so, why aren't we
doing what he asks us to do?

   First of all, I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in
response to 9/11. My hunch is not much. His interest was not in that
sort of thing. Besides, he had little political power.

   If we went to him and asked, I think he would probably tell a story.
He might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist. That's what the
parable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time.

   ""Who are you he might ask?"" Then tell a story to us as we stand
there with our mouths open and scratching our heads.

   Maybe he would tell a story like this:

   One day a rabbi, in a frenzy of religious passion, rushed in before
the ark, fell to his knees, and started beating his breast, crying,
""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!"" The cantor of the synagogue, impressed by
this example of spiritual humility, joined the rabbi on his knees. ""I'm
nobody!  I'm nobody!"" The custodian, watching from the corner, couldn't
restrain himself, either. He joined the other two on his knees, calling
out, ""I'm nobody! I'm nobody!"" At which point the rabbi, nudging the
cantor with his elbow, pointed at the custodian and said, ""Look who
thinks he's nobody!""

   I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood. I think that
one of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to
convince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus. What God is
interested in is saving human beings. That being the case what we must
do is be human. The Christian conspiracy, I'm going to call it, against
being human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be
like Jesus.

   A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan: WWJD. The goal was
to ask before doing any and everything, ""What would Jesus do?""

   If Jesus were here today, would he have worked for Enron? Would he
have been on the board of directors? If Jesus were here today, would he
go to church? Which one? The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up
was that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go
swimming because we had a lot of water in our town. Would he be a
Republican or a Democrat? Would he be involved in the political
process?

   The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this
by the extravagant way that he lived his life. He wasn't married; he
didn't hold down a job; he didn't have to raise kids. The Roman church
has it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual
dimension, neither did his mother.

   What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love. The extravagant way
that Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that
God has for us. Boundless love. Inexpressible love. It is like God
comes down and puts arms around us and says, ""This is how much I love
you. Now love yourself like that."" This was the thing that marked the
ministry of Jesus. So Soren Kierkegaard writes, ""To will to be that
self which one truly is, is the opposite of despair.""

   How do you do that? Well, to be the self you truly are is to have a
particular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of
that history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you can't. To
accept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and
compassionate about our limitations. It is like you get up from where
you're sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look
at the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have
compassion for that person. It is that kind of acceptance.

   We are not to be like Jesus. We are to be Christ-like. There is a
world of difference.

   Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people. All of the
stories that you find in the New Testament are like that. Look at the
stories of his ministry. If a man can restore sight to a blind man, he
gives that person a new lease on life, a new self-confidence. If a man
can absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness, he gives her
the gift of self-respect. The crippled, the insane, the leper, the tax
collector, the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in
need of self-esteem and he extended it to them.

   The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the
moneychangers out of the temple. It may be temporarily embarrassing to
be kicked out of your accustomed place of business, but it has been
known to lead to self-respect. The message is: You're made for
something better than this. You are loved by God. This self-compassion
is foundational for the abundant life and I'm sure that the response
Jesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest
of life is this kind of love.

   He would tell a story. One of his central teachings was: You shall
know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free. (But first it's going
to mess with your life and upset you!) So, let me tell you a story
about Truth to ponder. This story is from the Ethiopian culture.

   Long ago, Fire, Water, Truth, and Falsehood lived together in one
large house. Although all were polite toward each other, they kept
their distance. Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room.
Fire constantly leapt out of Water's path.

   One day they went hunting together. They found a large number of
cattle and began driving them home to their village. ""Let us share
these cattle equally,"" said Truth as they traveled across the
grasslands. ""This is the fair way to divine our captives.""

   No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood. Falsehood wanted more
than an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment. As the four
hunters traveled back to the Village, Falsehood went secretly to Water
and whispered, ""You are more powerful than Fire. Destroy Fire and then
there will be more cattle for each of us!""

   Water flowed over Fire, bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone.
Water meandered along, cheerfully thinking about more cattle for
itself.

   Falsehood, meanwhile, whispered to Truth. ""Look! See for yourself!
Water has killed Fire! Let us leave Water, who has cruelly destroyed
our warmhearted friend. We must take the cattle high in the mountains
to graze.""

   As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain, Water tried to
follow. But the mountain was too steep; And Water could not flow
upwards. Water washed down upon itself, splashing and swirling around
rocks as it tumbled down the slope. Look and see! Water is still
tumbling down the mountainside to this day.

   Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop. Falsehood turned to
Truth and said in a loud voice, ""I am more powerful than you! You will
be my servant. I am your master. All the cattle belong to me!""

   Truth rose up and spoke out, ""I will not be your servant!""

   They battled and battled. Finally they brought the argument to Wind
to decide who was the master.

   Wind didn't know. Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether
Truth or Falsehood was more powerful. Some people said, ""A single word
of Falsehood can completely destroy Truth."" Others insisted, ""Like a
small candle in the dark, Truth can change every situation.""

   Wind finally returned to the mountain and said, ""I have seen that
Falsehood is very powerful. But it can rule only where Truth has
stopped struggling to be heard.""

   And it has been that way ever since.

   I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is
that he would likely tell a story. And then he would remind us that we
ourselves are telling a story with our lives. After saying that,
perhaps he would ask, ""Is the story you are telling with your life the
truth?""

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

"RE: Replacement of J Bolton","Paula, 
I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.  It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.  Let me know when you would like to rally.

Thanks, Kim.

P.S.  Paula, congratulations on the new grandbaby!  I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well!

We just received this information regarding our new corporate expense card.  I'm not sure I see any benefits by getting one of the new Wright Travel Cards vs. using the EFCU.  Would you please look this over and let me know your thoughts.  If I choose to stay with the EFCU, I would probably like to get  a different card from the current EFCU Master Card so that I can keep my business and personal charges separate.  

Can you provide me your thoughts?

Subject:	Message from Morris Brassfield - ETS Travel and Entertainment Card Announcement

I am pleased to announce completion of negotiations with Wright Express to provide a travel and entertainment program for Enron Operations Services Company.   Travel and entertainment cards will be provided to any individual employed by the pipeline companies, who is required to travel on company business.   Each employee will be required to complete the attached application and agreement form, secure management approval and fax to Mary Ann Johnson at (713) 345-3479.   The T&E card will be mailed directly to the applicant. 

Implementation
Employees may use the T&E cards for domestic and international business travel.  Monthly, each employee will be required to complete an expense report utilizing the XMS system, if expenses are incurred.  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .    Approved business travel expenses will be reimbursed to the employee via direct deposit or check, depending on how your payroll is currently processed.  Personal use of the card is discouraged.

The Wright Express travel and entertainment card has contingent liability, whereas, the employee's personal credit may be evaluated if:
*	Outstanding balances exceeding $3,500 or delinquent payments beyond 25 days past the due date.
*	A monthly line of credit for business travel exceeding $3,500.

Employees who are required to travel on Company business and expect to exceed the monthly $3,500 spending limit, may request a higher limit.  If you routinely require a spending limit exceeding $3,500 per month, please check the box under ""Company Information"" on the attached application form.  Your request will be submitted to Enron Operations Service Management and Wright Express for approval.  You will be notified of approval or denial concerning your request.
	
All travel and entertainment MasterCard accounts are due each month to Wright Express.  Failure, by the employee to pay Wright Express each month, submit expense reports or submit receipts may trigger card cancellation.

Procedure
The travel and entertainment procedure can be found on the ETS website at http://www.ets.enron.com/pandSM/Employees will be responsible to review this procedure and comply with all requirements.  Following receipt of the signed, approved application and employee agreement form, employees should expect to receive a T&E credit card within ten to fifteen working days, but no later than March 15, 2002.

Card Activation:
Upon receipt of the travel and entertainment card, you will be required to follow the instructions on the sticker using the activation call-in number.  Following activation, you may immediately begin to use your T&E card.

Rewards Program
Wright Express travel card holders may participate in a rewards program, which is outlined in an attached document.  All fees charged by Wright Express for the rewards program is the employee's personal responsibility. 

Please address all questions concerning the travel and entertainment program to Bruce Martin 713-345-1833, Cheri Sublet 713-345-3475, Mary Ann Johnson 713-345-3479 or Morris Brassfield 713-646-7006.

DIRECTIONS FROM LISA:

Hello Everyone-  Here are detailed directions to the beach cabin for the
Nov. 30  girl's weekend.


Directions to the Polk Beach Cabin:

Go south on IH-45.

Take the Harborside Dr. exit when you get to Galveston and turn left
under the highway (this is the first exit after crossing the causeway,
so be watching for it).

Travel approx. 6 miles on Harborside Dr. to Ferry Rd.

Turn left on Ferry Rd., go to the end, and catch the ferry to Bolivar (
this is a free drive-on ferry operated by the Texas Hwy Dept.).

After exiting the ferry you will be on Bolivar Peninsula Hwy 87.  Travel
approximately 11.5 miles to the Emerald II edition (the Crystal Beach
water tower is a good land mark when you are getting close and the
Emerald II edition is the first road after the post office).

Turn right into Emerald II (there is a small green sign).  After
entering, turn left on Flamingo, and follow the curve around to
Eastview.  The cabin is on the right about half way down and is located
on the corner of Eastview and Crestview.  The address is 919 Eastview
and ""J.S. Polk"" is written on the side.

The telephone # is 409-684-0195.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone!!

James ran numbers.  $.22 for 10 yr. for 43,300/d is a DCF of 16.57% with no resubscriptions.  This looks better than any of the 5 year cases on either a 120/d case or 150/d case.  Thoughts?  We have not approached Duke with a 10 yr term yet.  Thanks, Kim and Michelle

No bullets just an FYI for you.

El Paso Field Services called this week to inquire whether TW?Enron would consider selling off any of its assets.  I spoke with Gina Tylor about who to refer this question to and she said Eric's group.  Kevin and I called EPFS back and they are interested specifically in buying the Atoka and Crawford laterals.  While such a sale of assests would have a big impact on TW, it's alittle too early to tell if EPFS is serious.  I'll keep you posted.

Have a Safe & Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !!

 

THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS 

By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced 
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out 
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the 
holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine 
without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate 
second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, 
they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your 
favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think 
so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. 
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you 
follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to 
New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. 

1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on 
   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In 
   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where 
   they're serving rum balls. 

2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine 
   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than 
   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. 
   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's 
   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. 
   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than 
   you think. It's Christmas! 

3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of 
   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill 
   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. 

4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk 
   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a 
   sports car with an automatic transmission. 

5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control 
   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? 

6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. 
   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the 
   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
   eggnog. 

7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like 
   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position 
   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before 
   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of 
   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them 
   again. 

8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. 
   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one 
   dessert? Labor Day? 

9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the 
   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, 
   have some standards, mate. 

10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the 
    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. 
    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just 
    around the corner.

Due to higher swings in the SoCal window causing higher line pack, parks were not made available most of the month.  TK continues to challenge our ability to accomodate PNR's.

"Rome Hotel - Respond immediately please","Hey guys and girls,

Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of the trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate response from the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.  I believe it is a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they charge).  From the article in my book, they have recently remodeled.  They are located near our Hotel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza Del Popolo.  The rate is 430,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we won't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancellation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says they have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cancellation with our reservation.  

I think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from the others, if at all. 

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  

Thanks, Kim.

40% of the total sum, upon the reciept of your
personal response, I will than send to you via fax or

The purpose of this memo is to inform you of organizational changes for ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.

	Security found purse & briefcase around 11 pm last night -- someone on 49 had taken it to their cubicle; I guess they 
	were waiting for someone to show up asking about it, but then they left or went to a meeting, and weren't there when

Hi Dot.

Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see 
what she says.

Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.

	Kim -- Do you know someone named Audrey Robertson?  She books the 49/C2 room.  I need to know if someone 
	turned in a purse and a briefcase this morning (left there).  And, if not, who booked that room after Stan's 8 am -9:30 
	staff meeting was over.

	(I've tried to call her; got her no. from Cindy Stark, but no answer.  I don't know if she is in today or not.  I went up to 
	49/C2 and no purse or briefcase is there.  Yes -- I am losing it!)

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday. 

Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.  

Thanks for your time,

Kim.   X33098

Pursuant to our conversation earlier today on the marketing strategy for incremental delivery capacity at SoCal Needles, Michelle and I researched the contracts with primary deliveries at PG&E Topock.  Following is a list of the discounted rate shippers to Topock:

PG&E Trading
40,000 MMBtu/d
$0.10.75


SMUD
10,000 MMBtu/d
$0.17

(There are no shippers with EOC delivery points who would move their delivery point to Topock on a primary basis.)

"RE: Questar San Juan Hub Interconnect","Earl,

We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.

Subject:	Questar San Juan Hub Interconnect

All,

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a ""Payment Plan"" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.  

We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.  After execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.

Thanks, 
Kim    713-853-3098

"Questar OBA","Bill,

Here are the changes to the OBA.  Please review.  Also, please look at para 5(c).  Since this gas will only be a San Juan supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.  So, if the TW San Juan pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San Juan Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.  


Questar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?


Thanks,  Kim.

The project C.014724 - Gray County Pipeline - was ready fro service on 12-14-01. The Interconnect C.014798 - Gray County Interconnect - has not gone into service because of the bankruptcy filing by Enron. Vendors, will not ship us some transmitters and other start up materials unless we can pay for them up front. We have tried to work with them on payments and no luck to date. We are trying another option where a local contractor will purchase the material and we will pay them for the service. As soon as we can get these issues settled, we can place the I/C into service.

Subject: TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)



DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated flow I was showing on the outage report was 130 mmcfd, (per Eric Faucheaux Planning) and the actual affect is 180 mmcfd.

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/01 to 12/01/01) Darrell is going to post something on it today.

I also had a WT2 outage on the report that the field was asking for. It showed a complete Station shut down for 24 hours. Darrell and I talked the field into moving it to next year. (Early March) If you have any questions let me know.

Subject:	New Contract System - Impact on One-part/Two-part Indicator
Importance:	High

Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.  

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

I did receive the signed I/C Agreement from Questar late on Friday.  I am currently routing it for approval for TW's signature.  If putting a hold on this meter would help improve the in-service date, I would definitely recommend it.  Would you please provide me your thoughts.

Jo, I actually mentioned this in our TW staff meeting with Steve yesterday about using the OBA's to balance this point for November service if the interconnect was not ready.  We could carve out a few minutes after one of the morning meetings to discuss this with Market Services - both TW and NNG representatives to work out the details for their shop.  FYI, Michelle is working with Burlington to deliver gas to NNG@Gray on their firm contract as well as discussions with Oneok to deliver gas to TW@Gray.

fyi.  I had requested Earl to provide an update on this interconnect.  If we have actual flows scheduled (and we know we have 25,000 of firm contracted) before the 12/1 date, we might have to do something at Halley to balance flows.  Should we start working out the details of that?

R-O-W has gave 30 day notice to adjacent landowners
Survey has been completed for pipeline
SHPO & F&F survey being completed on pipeline route
Valves has been quoted for a 8 -12 week delivery, unacceptable. Have requested buyer purchase Grove Valves with a 4 week delivery.
Should know on pipe this week for delivery and cost.
The existing Gray county I/C will be relocated to P-3 as a complete unit
An 8"" meter tube and two 12"" valves have been located from surplus for installing at the original I/C with dry flow measurement
Installation will be T&M to reduce time frame for bid package and drawings and allow quicker contractor move in and start up.

The target date is 11-1-01, but with the delay, 2 1/2 months, in approving the P.A., as stated in the original cost estimates, E&C required a June approval to meet the in service date of 11-1-01, we have a forecast ready for service date of 12-01-01. We will expedite materials and installation in an attempt to meet the target date.
If any questions, lease let me know

	""On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000.""

Rob Cooper (of US Gypsum) asked me to send him an email concerning our decision to not to force USG to provide the remaining 8 months of LOC and also asked me to verify a couple of other points.  Below is my reply.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Paul, please provide the dollar amount needed in the blank below.
______________________________________________________________--

Rob,

After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims, we will not proceed in seeking the additional $___________ letter of credit (worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges).  The current letter of credit valued at $__________ is sufficient.

Also, our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1, 2002.  In our latest discussions with SOCAL, they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time.  It would probably be best for you to discuss this with them yourself to verify its availability completely and thoroughly.

Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Best regards,

Mark

Hi,

The new grandbaby Samantha, her mother and father are doing fine. She is on her way home this afternoon if the pediatrician believes that she is ready to be released.

Regarding Jim's resignation, I agree that we should not be pressured into putting anyone on the board that will not assist us in moving forward and handling the complex issues that the board faces this year. Jim indicated that he would wait to resign for as long as he could or until we find a replacement. We can discuss this further tonight. I'm available anytime after 6:30 pm. We could either get together or all go out to dinner at Hungrey's or where ever if that works. Since the candidates to replace Jew Don Bony are coming to the Spires tomorrow night, I would like to attend that meeting if everyone is agreeable.

Let me know what works for this evening with everyone.

Kim
Monday I will be on vacation.
I have listened to the message from Questar and it seems like that the Morongo Valley area ( with R.O.W issues) is a few miles away 
from the SOCAL interconnect. 
The distance from Needles to SOCAL interconnect is approximately 90 miles. The horse power requirements to handle up to
100 mmcf/d from Needles to SOCAL is around 2,500 hp.

Based on the above, and also assuming that SOCAL has the capacity to handle up to 100 mmcf/d at a pressure of 850 psig
at this location, the conversion/ compression cost is as follows:


Conversion costs for 90 miles:		 $9,000,000 

Compression cost:		           	 $6,000,000	

Total costs				$15,000,000

Note: As we have discussed before this cost is based on EE&CC cost estimate of 1997 plus 5% escalation for each year.

Hey, did we decide whether you were going to Florida with me in July?  The
meeting starts for me on Sunday, 7/14 and runs through Wednesday morning the
17th.

If you're interested, we could fly up on Thursday or Friday before and you
could fly out on Sunday the 14th.

This is apparently very close to Miami, so there may be someone we know that
we could visit.  I'm sending you a map via your hotmail account.

See if your job situation will permit you to go with me!

Good to hear from you Kim.  First, I did get the check.. I've been out of the office for over two weeks so it will be cashed this week sometime. Sorry about that.   I had not heard anything about a suprise party for Rich in Houston but regardless, with Red Rock, annual outages etc...  it would probably be a difficult time for me.  If I can help with anything please give me a yell.  The next trip to Houston, will probably tie in with a family vacation to Tx. sometime in July.  

We are making arrangements to give Rich a retirement party in the field as well.  I was responsible for donations as you know (got to keep it quiet now but we are getting him a four wheeler).  Rick and Arnie are setting up the party which will probably be on April 13 and most likely in Belen, Nm.  

Again, the check will be cashed this week. and thanks to all of you....  My wife is making a card and we will have your names included...

Tiny, 

I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.  Will you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.

Good luck on Bisti!

Thanks, Kim.

DD -

Well, perhaps your poor Texas cousins need to make another trip up there to 
see their rich Arkansas relations, their mountain hideaway and that fabulous 
object d'art that you're rumored to have on loan from the Tate (not to be 
confused with O. L. ""Spud"" McLanahan's ""Tater"" Museum, with its current 
exhibition titled ""Homage to the Yam"").

Once we return from Bella Italia (perhaps even planning while climbing steps 
up to or down from an Amalfi aerie, assuming we can spare enough breath to 
speak), we could look at a November or December date for a long weekend.

I can't tell you how much Kim and I are looking forward to another trip across 
the pond with the A team.  Six weeks and counting, I'm thinking, and I can 
already taste the first glass of vino rosso at Alla Rampa.  It's been too 
long.

Tonight, we're hosting a flood-delayed Father's Day (Tom) and an early 
birthday (Wanda) combo-dinner at Pappas Bros Steakhouse.  Tomorrow evening the 
Donnellys are arranging a sitter so that the grown-ups can meet for dinner and 
a movie that doesn't have a single purple dinosaur or juice box or singing 
cowboy (although there may be other music in a movie titled ""Captain Corelli's 
Mandolin,"" I suspect -- just to get us in the mood for the trip).

Hope golf is treating you well, and that you're abusing the hell out of those 
little dimpled aerospheres.

Looking forward to seeing you guys in six weeks for la dolce vita in Roma.

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

I just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.


http://hotelcondotti.com/rooms.html

http://www.hotelfirenzeroma.it/ing/hotel.htm

Please check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think.  The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice.  We know that Firenze was fine and I'm certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game.  

John, do you have a preference?  Paul please talk with Judy and let me know what your vote is.   Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome.  Once I tally the votes, I'll confirm the hotel.


Thanks, Kim.

"Italy, again","My Italian Amigos,

I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.  They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.  They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD).  The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.  I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located.  This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.  

Is this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?

Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.  I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.

Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.



P.S.  We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8!

"RE: Red Soup Recipe","Hattie,
 
This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.
 
Good Luck!
 
Kim.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	""On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000.""

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

Subject:	Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

	I am not sure what the deal will be, as I am waiting to get a referral and to get into the neurosurgeon.  However, I spoke to a surgeon friend of mine in San 
	Angelo this weekend.  She says I should not plan on being able to go.  She said if it were just a month later, I might could make it.  But she says that, 
	even if I get the surgery scheduled soon, that there will be a lot of rehab and that first of Oct. is too soon to stop rehab.  I was hoping to get some definite 
	answers to questions today, but neither my regular doctor (who said she would call me back today after she received the information on the tests done 
	by the neurologist, etc.), nor the nerologist, who I left a message for, called me back.  So, I am not positive about anything...  The neurologist made it 
	sound like the recovery from this new ""microsurgery"" was not that difficult or long but he was not specific about the exact period.

	Do you have any back-up takers for going on the trip, in the event my doctors say ""no way""?

I'm so glad you know what the problem is.  My brother had a similar micro-surgery last year.  He went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days.  Will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery?  Is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to Italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery?  Keep me posted.  Thanks, Kim.

	Kim --

	Thanks for the note -- I had a cat scan yesterday, along with more hip x-rays.  Tomorrow, I have something called an EMG -- ""electro-myogram"" -- sounds 
	similar to the old ""myleograms"", so I just assumed it would be similar -- dye into the spinal cord & take pictures.  However, Staci looked it up on the 
	Internet for me and reported that it is a series of needle probes into various muscles to check for nerve problems, and is somewhat painful -- just what I want 
	at this point!   Surely doesn't sound too great...  oh well, still hope to find something out by tomorrow around noon...
	
	I did hear from a friend of mine, who had something similar a few years ago; she opted for some injections into her back, which worked, so that would be 
	better than surgery or continuing like this, at least. The neurologist did say last week that it is not necessarily my back (altho' that is the most likely 
	cause of this) but said that it could be something in my hip...  So, maybe I'll have a number of options, like physical therapy, injections, etc. and not just 
	surgery.

Dot,

Please keep me posted on your tests.  Also, don't forget to tell the doctors that you just need the really BIG shot now so that you will be ready for Italy in the fall.  Don't over-do it!  I does take time for the back to heal.  

I had lunch with Sue Neville yesterday and she had some great advise for the Amalfi Coast(she and her family just returned from Italy).  On one of the islands near the Amalfi Coast, there are plenty of ""natural spa's"" with salt water, fresh water, hot, cold, dry and wet saunas.  Sounds like a good stop and may even be helpful to your current condition.

Stay flat!

	Update -- went to see neurologist on Friday (only got in that early because I practically yelled at a number of people for several hours on Thursday -- I guess they think people can afford to wait 6 weeks to see if they feel any better!  They were willing to set me up with an appointment in Sept., can you imagine???).  

	Anyway, the neurologist knew what nerve is pinched but not where it is getting pinched, where the problem is coming from -- could be my back or my hip.  Having x-rays and cat scan on Monday pm, with something called EMG on Wed.  Let you know what I learn.

FYI,

 8/08/01, is the next Outage Coordination Commercial Review meeting.  There will be a few changes to the monthly meeting. First, you will see the name has changed. The change was made to help maintain our focus of the meeting. Which is review the outages where flows are affected and discuss their impact with the Commercial groups. The meeting will focus mainly on outages that have some throughput loss. If you have any questions or concerns please give me a call.  

Thank you

To the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items, it will expedite our discussion (just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information) :

Price Spreads for ROFR contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy.
Imbalances on OBA's
Analysis of I to I spreads.  -  Review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads.  Would we have made more money?  Is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an I to I rate?
Update Map - coordinate with Darrell, Facility Planning and NNG.
West Texas Leg - discussion on our preparation for the Facility Planning/Marketing Strategy Meeting.
Arizona Strategy - including Sun Devil.
Pooling.
Analysis of our business sold and utilized.  FT, Alt. Points, IT and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points. (On this item, we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information)
Weekend on call schedule - update
Phones

Frequency of our staff meeting.
Industry Conferences
Vacation Schedules

Subject: 

On 01/04/02, M Kester, S Dernovich & R Aragon met with Bryan Dils and Jack Gasten (both Senior O & M Technicians) of Transwestern.

The TW reps agreed that the best method to accomplish the Blanco interconnect would be for TW to tap its existing 30 inch (formerly NWPL Ignacio-Blanco) pipeline that is running N-S approx 120 lf east of the proposed S Trails Blanco Meter site.

To accomplish the tie in would then require about 120 lf of 20 inch (or perhaps 12 inch) pipeline, parallel to the right of way corridor that Questar has already acquired from TW for the extension to WFS Milagro.

The custody transfer meter facilities and any control facilities would then be installed on the Questar site.

TW stated that pressure ranges between 928 to 950 psig in this  30 inch pipeline.

Agreement needs to be finalized on who installs the tap, pipeline tie in, and meter facilities.    It would be good if TW would agree that Questar could accomplish all work, with the exception of the tap of the 30 inch pipeline.

In any event, S Trails needs to contribute our meter parcel site for the location for meter facilities, whether TW or Questar installes these facilities.  

The TW reps were going to convey this info to Ron Mathews of TW.   Conceptually, this location is as shown on the TW dwg, dated 11-26-01, prepared by RLM.

The Questar group is also determining how the parcel size can be expanded, from the current 75 by 100 to about 100 by 125, to accomodate all these facilities.   Paragon's rep is negotiating parcel acquisition with El Paso for this site.

Kim-

Listed below are the issues, pretty much as written, in the meeting on the West Texas Leg.  Some are self-explanatory while others are somewhat cryptic.  I will follow up with a list that better defines each issue, and you might have your guys think about each as well.  We'll get back together soon (I'm not sure I can do it this week), and discuss an action plan.

-	CS 9 fuel
-	Atoka Lateral 	We have both supply and market opportunities within the lateral itself
-	Turbocharge the Atoka #3 units
-	Look at Zia pressure obligation on the contract
-	Agave replacement gas at Atoka #3
-	Complete the loop between WT-1 and WT-2
-	Coolers to WT-2
-	Pecos compressor re-wheel and engine upgrade
-	200 	300 (WT-2 to Pecos) flow study
-	Look at Block Valve 16 bi-directional interconnect w/Sid Richardson, and ability flow incremental above 340 on the total system
-	Look at Keystone into NNG; back to TW south of WT-2
-	Check pressure of Stations 6 & 7, and PNM receipts
-	MAOP restriction on Panhandle leg due to encroachment

Let's talk.

Thanks,

MG

Subject: RE: Procedures for Transwestern Gas Control/Marketing Morning Meetings


        Please ignore the previous memo.  I had a wrong date in it.  Thanks. Lynn

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.
 
Lynn

I'm still OK taking off tomorrow and next week.  Maybe we stay home this weekend to be with Herschel, and if he is better, then we can take him to my mom's on Mon or Tue and go on to the Hyatt Hill Country next week.

Subject:	El Paso Had Market Power



In a release from Natural Gas Intelligence according to FERC staff counsel, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy possessed market power during the summer of 2000 and violated FERC's marketing affiliate standards. The article states that El Paso had market power after May 2000 for at least two months when pipeline capacity constraints created a separate relevant geographic market in California. The evidence pointed to the now-infamous February 7 and 9, 2000 telephone conversations showing that the operating employees of El Paso Merchant, El Paso Natural Gas and Mojave Pipeline ""were not functioning independently,"" according to staff counsel. 

The phone conversations took place just days before El Paso pipeline began its open season for 1.22 Bcf/d of firm, capacity on its system (bound for California), all awarded to El Paso Merchant.

Before and during the open season, EPME gained new information about the restructured long-term tiered discount on Mojave to Wheeler Ridge while potential non-affiliate shippers were not according to counsel. As a result, counsel find that EPME's group had an undue competitive advantage with the new Mojave discount generating a successful bid for the El Paso pipeline capacity. 

FERC Chief ALJ Wagner is expected to issue an initial decision in early October.

Amaco LaPlata
Northwest Pipeline - La Plata

WFS LaMaquina
WFS Milagro - Blanco Hub
TransColorado - Blanco Hub
Burlington - Blanco Hub

I hope this is not to much trouble...   My priority for now lies with Amaco/La Plata... No hurry on any of the others..  Thank you so much

Since Jeff Fawcett left, do either of you have an interest in giving his desktop access to Prophet X software (via the FIMI server)  to someone else in your group?  Since TW is still paying Jeff's user fee, I need to either have FIMI remove his permission from the server, or I can have them change the permission on the server to a different user.

Please let me know what you would like to do, and I'll take the appropriate action with FIMI.

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Questar Can't Sell from Proposed Pipeline Under New CA Rate 
Although not giving up its search for customers in California, Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp.'s oil-to-natural-gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners of New Mexico remains stymied in operating its portion within California under a newly revised ""peaking tariff"" for Southern California Gas Co., according to Questar officials who have been analyzing the new rate established Aug. 2 by state regulators.  Questar is looking at alternative uses for the California portion of the approved interstate pipeline. 
""We can't work with (the rate) as it is,"" said Chad Jones, a Questar spokesperson. ""It definitely doesn't go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in Southern California. It still doesn't level the playing field. Although it is better than the current RLS (residual load service) tariff; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCalGas competitor. 
""Customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state, and higher rates for balancing services. We're at the point where we're not going to stop trying to market capacity on Southern Trails, but we're definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the California portion (of the 700-miles, 16-inch-diameter pipeline)."" 
One of the alternatives would be to operate the California part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the Long Beach Harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the California-Arizona border. That's the alternative, however, Jones said, but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline's 120 MMcf/d capacity is still Questar's preference. 
After months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives, the California Public Utilities Commission last week established a new ""peaking"" or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a SoCalGas competitor, allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility, SoCalGas. 
The CPUC tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers, while trying to ""encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry-picking or overbuilding,"" according to CPUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Questar officials said Tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources, and they are ""not about to go head-to-head with the established big boys"" in lobbying California's governor or state legislature, Jones said. ""Thus, we're still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in Southern California in the name of promoting competition."" 
The east-of-California portion of the Southern Trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid-year next year, Jones said.

Subject:	Contract Discount specs- 2 questions

I'm looking at Quickplace Business Requrement BUSRQ13.doc ""Setup & Maintenance of Contract Level Discounts""
I have a question about a couple of discount data elements defined for TW.

#1
On p. 11, the requirements define values for Item (31) Discount Type:
TW 
M - Negotiated
D - Discounted

? In CBS, ""M"" flags ""priority"" rates which are like NNG's Tariff Exceptions.  
Does TW plan to use the Deal Sheet to enter both discounts & all priority/exception rates?  for discounts and for 
priority rates associated with FERC-defined Negotiated Rates?  Do you plan to differentiate between FERC Negotiated Rate exceptions  and other exceptions like surcharges, low-load GRI Reservation contracts, or points where normal tariff rates are not applicable?

NNG
C-Competitive
S-Settlement (I dont' think ""S"" has been used for anything except a few Gathering deals stemming from the Global Settlement).  

------
#2
Item (27) Tier Indicator
How do different types of Tiered TW rates work?
A=Range Average
C=Daily Range
D=Daily Tier  (Tier volume applies to flow per day?)
R=Range
T=Tier
Z=None (does this just signify a non-tiered discount?)

NNG Tiered discounts can be 
D=Based on levels of daily flow
M=Based on monthly volume levels - used mainly with tiered-reservation rates. 
    For example, if a contract has MDQ of 10,000, Monthly Tiered discount could be for
$4 on first 5000
$3 on next 2500
max rate on remaining 2500

The legal description for the proposed Southern Trails interconnect north of the Blanco Hub is Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, San Juan County, NM.  This is on the old NWPL receipt line coming off the 30"" Ignacio - Blanco line into the Blanco Hub upstream of the El Paso Blanco measurement.  Bottom line is it's the same place we talked about earlier this week.

  Yes Ronnie, I would still like to do that for 2 reasons.

1.	It moves the overhaul on unit 401 into March, which is the same month we are doing the tie-ins at Station 1 and 3. And since there will be a flow restriction from those tie-ins we can coordinate the two outages together and save a little of the flow loss.
2.	Starting and finishing the overhauls earlier will keep us away from our summer comments, if there are problems or delays.    

       If  there are no objections, I will change the dates to the new schedule listed below.

Note:

Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.  The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.

This difference is mainly due to the following:
$10.0m   -   negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
$ 2.7m   -    SoCal rate issue - $not collected
$ 1.8m   -    additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.  

Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

Please call me at x36709 if there are questions

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.

At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.

SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.  SWG hopes to have a decision to move forward by year end 2001.

Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)

Kim,

At one time there was someone in marketing looking at developing salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

I99-07-003  SoCal Unbundling.  SoCal filed its Advice Letter No. 3015 to implement the CPUC's Dec. 11th decision to unbundle the SoCalGas Transmission and Storage Systems however the filing only addresses Ordering Paragraph Nos. 9-15 of the decision.  This section of the order directs SoCal to outline within their tariff the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement arrangements for allocating stranded costs.  It does not address capacity or open season issues as dictated by the order.  We will investigate the filing with SoCal as to the status of addressing these issues. 

A01-10-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  In regard to filing comments on EGA's motion to strike the testimony and related materials on embedded cost-based allocation versus the long-run marginal cost methodology for the hearing on Monday, Jan. 7, 2002, it was decided not to file comments, but continue monitoring the proceeding.  By participating Transwestern will continue to have the option of addressing any of the issues raised by other parties.

CPUC Infrastructure Report.  The Commission has issued its report and assessment of the state's gas infrastructure for the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide reliable amounts of competitively priced gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.

Agreement - Revised 


Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a ""permit"" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their ""ducks in a row"" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.
Kirk

Hi Kirk,

I just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was
going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me
know if we can do anything for you.

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk

"FW: Article on SoCal ""Peaking"" Rate","Glen,

Can you help interpret this impact of this decision on California customers for us?  Since we are looking at the Southern Trails system again, is this really good for them?  Exactly what is the rate the peaking customer would be charged?

Many thanks, Kim.

Subject:	Article on SoCal ""Peaking"" Rate

New Peaking Rate for SoCalGas Could Spur Bypass 
After various fits and starts surrounding the issue over a number of months, California regulators Thursday established an alternative demand stand-by charge, called a ""peaking rate,"" for Southern California Gas Co., which could open up the utility to ""economic bypass"" by interstate pipeline projects lined up and ready to go at the border. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) rejected the utility's own proposal as ""anti-competitive."" 
""This case has been very contentious,"" said the lead commissioner assigned to the case, Richard Bilas. ""For the most part, the response to SoCal's application was negative."" Noting active opposition from large end-users, merchant generators and interstate pipelines, Bilas said that it is difficult to find an ideal peaking rate for gas. CPUC President Loretta Lynch dropped an alternate proposal to support Bilas. 
Ideally, the regulators are trying to keep the utility and its captive customers whole, while not deterring the option of what they call ""economic bypass,"" said Bilas, noting that SoCalGas' proposals did not ""reflect market reality. The new rate calculation is very complex, and potential competitors have yet to comment on its impact. 
A number of proposed interstate pipelines are lined up at the border awaiting a decision which would make it economic for them to proceed into SoCalGas territory, including an expansion of Mojave to Sacramento, Questar Corp.'s proposed Southern Trails oil-to-natural gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners area to Long Beach, and Kinder Morgan and Calpine's Sonoran pipe to San Francisco.
Up to this point the utility's residual load service (RLS) charges -- which customers of other pipelines had to pay in addition to charges paid to the transporting pipelines -- made it uneconomic to sign up on other lines. Called on by the CPUC to come in with a more moderate system, SoCalGas had proposed replacing the RLS charge with a peaking charge that customers said was just as onerous. 
The CPUC made its decision on a revised peaking charge unanimously on a 4-0 vote, with one of the five-member body's commissioners absent. 
The CPUC action establishes a peaking rate for SoCalGas customers who want to take only partial service from the utility and get their baseload service from another pipeline. Customers will be required to pay a monthly demand charge, public goods charge collected on a volumetric basis (so if there is no use, there is no charge), a reservation charge with a complex formula, and an interruptible peaking rate for volumes actually received. 
Peaking customers will be subject to daily balancing and a credit for service interruptions of firm capacity, which will apply to both new and existing facilities. 
""The new rate contrasts to the rate design in place for SoCalGas' standard full-requirements firm-load customers who pay for priority on a volumetric basis,"" Lynch said. ""We're changing the peaking rates so that customers not taking their full service from the utility will only pay for the amount of capacity they use on any given day. 
""The challenge for the CPUC in this case was to establish a peaking tariff for natural gas service that fairly compensates SoCalGas for standing ready to serve the peak needs only of some customers, while those customers go off its system for their baseload needs, but also to develop a tariff that allows SoCalGas to be able to compete with some of the energy company pipelines that plan to enter into SoCal's service territory. 
""We're trying to encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry picking or overbuilding for which core customers would end up paying for,"" Lynch added.

Houshyar -

Based on committee input yesterday and Patsy Bolton's investigation, I have
filled in the budget numbers for the attached board request.  I understand
that it needs to go before the Finance Committee prior to presentation to
the board, so I would ask your assistance in providing a copy to Lew Humke
and the other committee members.

I will be out of town on Thursday and Friday, returning late Friday night,
so I will not be immediately available to answer questions about the
proposal.  Should you need to contact me, I can be paged at (713) 687-6941.

Let me stress the time crunch under which we are working:  we were fortunate
to get a prime location at a reasonable per person cost tentatively booked
at this late date, but they are going to need a firm contract before the
actual date can be secured.  This does need board action this week.

Thanks for your help.  If you need to reach me today, my contact information
is shown below.  After today, you can reach me by pager.

Thanks again,

Just a couple of additional thoughts,  the cost estimate for ESD mods of $130,000 will typically be, about 25% more.  The E&C costs,  company overheads and construction support will increase these costs to around $170,000.  I did talk with Fred this morning and will relay the highlights of our conversation.  

The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 35 - 50 mmcfd.  The gas supply is from the Leedy Plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.  The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at Ivanhoe.  The gas end up with NNG on the North side of the lateral,  this Lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.  The 2 units at Ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG.  Since they have not run in some time, its probable to spend an additional $300,000 to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.  Then we would most likely have to design and resize the units for an additional guess of $350,000.

In order to abandon these units, I would recommend we abandon in place or Plant Held For Future Use.  My guess is about $15 - 25,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.  I do know that there is some drilling going on in the area,  I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any different than the current status.

Let us know your comments.

Here is an estimate for the upgrade to the Ivanhoe ESD system.   Please keep in mind that the HP at the location has not been in operation for several years and If it is ever required, we may be looking a major expense for that, too.  ($200,000+or-)

I have been contacted by Questar this morning and they brought up several options, They build, own and operate, and I indicated there wasn't a problem from E&C if this was the deal Marketing set up. He is to send preliminary designs for E&C to review and materials they use.

Here is the pricing information on the DTN feed.  I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the initial fee of $1,000 will be waived.

The minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25.  Do you want to see the real-time feeds?  It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users.  

Please let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP.  Also, there will be no additional cost to have this on the 13 floor and move it to our final destination (there used to be a large fee for moving locations).

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.

Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car). 

FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.  

Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.  She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.

Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.

I will keep you posted as we hear more.

I have 2 Alamo full size 4 dr/5 passenger  cars reserved for you. We do not
have to prepay. The all-inclusive
rate is 1,617250. ITL (approx 742.00) for the 12 days. This includes
collision and theft insurance, taxes and
unlimited mileage. I think that this is very good. 1 car booked under John
Watson and 1 under Dennis Dye.
They are manuals.

The ferry from Palermo to Naples is daily, departing at 800pm, arriving
700am. It looks as though the vehicles will cost between 111,600 and 134,600
each. The passengers in a double outside cabin are 96,500 to 111,500. ) I
believe, per passenger.

The ferry from Palermo to Livorno departs at 1100pm and arrives the next day
about 5pm. The double outside suite is
240,000. The coach seat is 120,000. Each car is 175,000 to 205,000. I need
to verify if the cabin rate includes the
passenger fee.

I had found a ferry to Salerno, but it only operates 1 day a week, not the
day you need.
I'll get back to you.

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

"Fuel Risk on Index to Index Deals","Steve and Dave,

As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index deals.  Here are my thoughts...

For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 could impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for this transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract will have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approximately 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over collected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have something less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collection.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assume after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seasonally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal.  

It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d of the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually burned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind fuel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actually used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not have additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity loss on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provided by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this particular day.  Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash prices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a price that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunity loss.  

Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?  Would you agree that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow?  

Thanks, Kim.

I'm so glad you know what the problem is.  My brother had a similar micro-surgery last year.  He went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days.  Will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery?  Is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to Italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery?  Keep me posted.  Thanks, Kim.

	Got the news today -- good news is we now know what the problem is & it can be fixed.  I have a protruding disc between L5 and S1 that is ""impinging 
	upon the nerve root for L5"" -- i.e., causing the numbness in my left leg and foot.  Bad news is -- surgery is the fix.  However, the neurologist says that 
	recovery from the surgery is pretty short, in light of the micro-surgery they now do on this.  Trying to get in to see the surgeon now, to see how soon 
	I can schedule something.  Keep you informed...

	Kim --

	Thanks for the note -- I had a cat scan yesterday, along with more hip x-rays.  Tomorrow, I have something called an EMG -- ""electro-myogram"" -- sounds 
	similar to the old ""myleograms"", so I just assumed it would be similar -- dye into the spinal cord & take pictures.  However, Staci looked it up on the 
	Internet for me and reported that it is a series of needle probes into various muscles to check for nerve problems, and is somewhat painful -- just what I want 
	at this point!   Surely doesn't sound too great...  oh well, still hope to find something out by tomorrow around noon...
	
	I did hear from a friend of mine, who had something similar a few years ago; she opted for some injections into her back, which worked, so that would be 
	better than surgery or continuing like this, at least. The neurologist did say last week that it is not necessarily my back (altho' that is the most likely 
	cause of this) but said that it could be something in my hip...  So, maybe I'll have a number of options, like physical therapy, injections, etc. and not just 
	surgery.

Please keep me posted on your tests.  Also, don't forget to tell the doctors that you just need the really BIG shot now so that you will be ready for Italy in the fall.  Don't over-do it!  I does take time for the back to heal.  

I had lunch with Sue Neville yesterday and she had some great advise for the Amalfi Coast(she and her family just returned from Italy).  On one of the islands near the Amalfi Coast, there are plenty of ""natural spa's"" with salt water, fresh water, hot, cold, dry and wet saunas.  Sounds like a good stop and may even be helpful to your current condition.

Stay flat!

They were willing to set me up with an appointment in Sept., can you imagine???).  

	Anyway, the neurologist knew what nerve is pinched but not where it is getting pinched, where the problem is coming from -- could be my back or my hip.  Having x-rays and cat scan on Monday pm, with something called EMG on Wed.  Let you know what I learn.

The work is completed and the project is closed.  The figures that I saw indicated that the project was under budget where Red Cedar might be receiving some change.  I think after a job has been closed and 180 days has passed then Property Accounting is the group responsible for handling the invoicing business that you are inquiring about.  Check with Kim Watson in this regard, she is currently working with some claim issues concerning the Calpine interconnect.  Perhaps she can direct you with the process.

At this point in time I need some assistance from Facility Planning in order to more specifically identify the areas EDG is concerned with.  Would you please let me know who I can work with on this one?

Also, earlier this year, TW constructed a new receipt point in the La Plata station yard for Red Cedar.  Red Cedar paid TW $450,000 for the new point stating that ""If the actual costs of constructing the new interconnect is less than $450,000, Red Cedar shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of the difference between $450,000 and the actual cost.""  Please let me know what the actual cost of the new facilities ended up being.  Thanks.

Listed below are some companies/individuals we have used in the past to provide translation services.  The first two would be the preferred.

CD Language Solutions, 713-661-9553, email: languagesolutions@prodigy.net

mellis.sanford@enron.com (can't find her number); she teaches Spanish at Enron

interlingua - Muriel Dupont # 713-957-2040

Carlos Varela #281-646-9754 (phone and fax), email is:  cvarela7@yahoo.com

If you are interested in using one these options I suggest we get a price quote first.  Since these people are scattered about in Houston, they like to do things over email if files are electronically available.  If not, I recommend using a courier service - such as City Central at 713-623-0303 (never had a problem with them).

If you have any questions or need any additional information please let me know.

Jeff

"RE: Trans Pecos Meeting","The MLP discussions have been on using Northern Border.  

Regarding KMI, Mark and I met with them before Xmas to see where they were on the rate.  They have not presented anything to their management team for approval beyond our original proposal.  

I believe that Stan is looking for the status of the game plan.  We are looking to lay out the game plan on how we would finance the project(if we project finance I think Stan and Danny are looking at securing enough money at the same time to do the Sun Devil, Trans Pecos and PG&E 20 mile line all together), define what the project return requirement is, determine the comfort factor of the project costs, staying in concert with KMI and making the final proposal to Pemex.  

I will make myself available at your convenience on Monday morning to discuss.

Have a great weekend.  Kim.

Subject:	New Mexico Power Plant Project

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

For your information, attached is the redlined version of the LOI from Pemex.  I have been discussing these comments with Dave Matney at Kinder Morgan.  I have also discussed these comments with Pemex and they do intend on giving us feedback on the rate we offered within the next week.  It is Pemex's intention to move forward with this LOI with an agreed upon rate (even though it currently says ""To Be determined"") prior to execution.  I will keep you posted as we get more information.  If you have any comments regarding any of these issues, please feel free to contact me, otherwise, please look forward to review our next draft prior to us sending it back to Pemex.

Thanks, 
Kim (X33098)

If the fuel is being nominated and scheduled the only volumes hitting the OBA are the diff. between scheduled and actual and that is what the OBA's are for as long as it is not being abused.

In the OBA meeting held today 01/03/02. Is the fuel being nominated or not at the Sid Richardson point #500395 or L.E. 8729? Yes it is and has been nominated as far back as I can retrieve information in TMS. The point came active in 12/1995 and remains active today. It is also part of their main OBA contract #21758. According to the information in CBS it was nominated and scheduled back then also. If there is more information or questions, please let me know. Thank you.

Hi Kim,

Just a note to see if you are still there at Enron.

I have gotten many e-mails back, mostly the tech guys, including Vince.

But I don't remember having got e-mails back from you, so maybe you are still there.

If so, I certainly wish you the best in whatever direction you ultimately take.

Obviously, Transwestern is an important pipeline and will continue to operate.

If we can be of help at any time in the future after the dust finally settles, please let me know.

Stay in touch!

Thanks,

Subject:	Bloomfield to Gallup Pigging

To recap past conversations, Bloomfield to Gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last February.  It is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig.  If this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity, re-application of the DRA will be considered.

How does pigging Bloomfield to Gallup the first week in October sound?  Darrell pointed out that would provide a week's run time on the Gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for September 29.

I suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig.  The afternoon of Monday, October 1, a conference call would be held.  If there were no complications with Gallup or any other issues, the pig run would be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday.

If you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Also please let me know if having the conference call at 2:00 p.m., CST, Monday, October 1, would work for you, and if not, then what time would be good.  I will plan on sending out the conference number and code next Monday, September 24.

Thanks,


John

Subject:	RE: Two proceeding changes

Christi --  I don't think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 either, and we are proceeding under the same schedule.  Several rehearing requests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES.  However, note the following which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercial and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without reading it.)  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this OMB ruling a good sign.  


As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market"" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, ""include an explicit discussion"").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when ""commenters"" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way.  OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after ""consulting with respondents"", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sends a signal!

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

As we discussed and agreed, we continue to plan on having the Transwestern meter for the new interconnect into Southern Trails located on our property at Blanco.  Will are planning for Transwestern to tie into it's pipeline and extend piping over to our site where the meter will be located.  Transwestern may need to aquire a small length of right-of-way from El Paso that will connect the TW property to the site we are getting from El Paso.  TW personel will have unlimited acess to this site.
We will create a lease agreement to lease the footprint for the meter to TW. 
As we discussed, this facility must be in operation on May1, 2002. 
Thank you for all your help.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a ""permit"" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their ""ducks in a row"" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.
Kirk

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a
vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be
approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in
the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect
agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk

Stan................just a reminder to follow up with the commercial group regarding the question about gas going off the system.  While we have capacity, the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers.  There was also the issue of better communication between the commercial group and the field.  They specifically mentioned a situation with ONEOK.  The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them, not our commercial group.

Again...............you did an outstanding job yesterday.

"FW: Attachment A - Payment Schedule","
All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay ""along the way"" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.


Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

"Italy","We have a response back from the Hotel Firenze (same hotel we stayed in before) in Rome for the last two nights of our trip (June 7 & 8) that they do have availability.  The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including.  They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.

I have not heard from the Hotel Conditti ( which is the hotel we had reservations for back in September and is located closer to the Spanish Steps than the Hotel Firenze) and hope to hear from them soon.  

I have also not heard back from the Marincanto Hotel in Positano.  I'll keep you posted. 

I thought we would give the Hotel Conditti another day to respond before making our decision.  If Conditti does not have space or is too pricey, are we OK with booking the Hotel Firenze?  I have not checked into other Rome hotels.  Let me know if you would like me to investigate others.

Please advise.

"RE: Tape","Hi Dan!

I am glad that your family is well.  My heart is so heavy with the tragedy of the WTC.  I cannot fully comprehend the enormity of it all.

I will be glad to bring the tape in.  I am actually going to be in the office late Sunday afternoon to begin packing my desk.  We are temporarily moving to the 13th floor mid next week while they reconstruct our floor.  

I will have the tape on my desk in an envelope with your name on it, too.  Also, I have a little book that you lent me with nice verses.  I will bring it as well. 

Thanks and take care.  Kim.

Kim,

Hope none of your family/friends were impacted by the WTC disaster.  We had a scare in our family.  My bro & sis-in-law, and 3 other cousins & their spouses are doctors.  Did not hear from them or about them for days.  Heard from my brother for the 1st time last night.  They were working round the clock helping the injured, so had no time to call!.  I was 90% sure they were OK, but that 10% caused sooooo much anxiety.  I just cannot imagine the plight of folks who probably are 150% sure that their loved ones are no more, but are still clinging on to some hope/miracle!.

I will probably swing by Enron tomorrow around 12:30 pm.  If possible, could you bring the tape on Logic of Sprituality with you.  If you are not going to be around, can you leave it on your desk!

Hope things are going well for you & Martha.  Please say hi to her. say hi to Janell too!

Take Care

Dan

"RE: Gray Interconnect","Jo, I actually mentioned this in our TW staff meeting with Steve yesterday about using the OBA's to balance this point for November service if the interconnect was not ready.  We could carve out a few minutes after one of the morning meetings to discuss this with Market Services - both TW and NNG representatives to work out the details for their shop.  FYI, Michelle is working with Burlington to deliver gas to NNG@Gray on their firm contract as well as discussions with Oneok to deliver gas to TW@Gray.

fyi.  I had requested Earl to provide an update on this interconnect.  If we have actual flows scheduled (and we know we have 25,000 of firm contracted) before the 12/1 date, we might have to do something at Halley to balance flows.  Should we start working out the details of that?

R-O-W has gave 30 day notice to adjacent landowners
Survey has been completed for pipeline
SHPO & F&F survey being completed on pipeline route
Valves has been quoted for a 8 -12 week delivery, unacceptable. Have requested buyer purchase Grove Valves with a 4 week delivery.
Should know on pipe this week for delivery and cost.
The existing Gray county I/C will be relocated to P-3 as a complete unit
An 8"" meter tube and two 12"" valves have been located from surplus for installing at the original I/C with dry flow measurement
Installation will be T&M to reduce time frame for bid package and drawings and allow quicker contractor move in and start up.

The target date is 11-1-01, but with the delay, 2 1/2 months, in approving the P.A., as stated in the original cost estimates, E&C required a June approval to meet the in service date of 11-1-01, we have a forecast ready for service date of 12-01-01. We will expedite materials and installation in an attempt to meet the target date.
If any questions, lease let me know

Subject:	RE: Transwestern EDI - Operationally Available and Unsubscribed Capacity


Everyone,

As stated below in Rich's memo, the quantities that will be posted in the new daily unsubscribed report are the same quantities that TW is currently sending in EDI files. As part of the permanent solution, the EDI process will need to be modied when the website is modified.

I would like to review messages that are sent in TW EDI files for unsubscribed capacity and operationally available capacity.

 TW currently sends a text message with each of the EDI unsubscribed capacity files that are sent to customers.  This message is:

	Capacity at these points is subject to the capacity available on the relevant path for the receipt and delivery point combination(s) requested. (2)  Please contact your Marketing Representative for information concerning point with capacity less than 5,000 Mcf/day. (3)  Transwestern is willing to consider expressions of interest concerning available capacity or requests for capacity.  Shipper interested in available capacity may either contact their Marketing Representative or submit a request for service to Transwestern Transportation Marketing, P.O.Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1199 or by facsimile to (713)646-8000.

For operationally available capacity, TW currently sends the following text message with each EDI operationally available file:

	The below listed capacity is an estimate of the unutilized capacity that will be available on the effective date above, until further notice is posted.  The capacity is only an estimate and is subject to change without notice due to the transient nature of pipeline operations.  There are no guarantees expressed or implied that this capacity will be available.  Formal nominations to the pipeline will be processed in accordance witht he company's tariff provisions for scheduling of all available capacity.

Please review and let me know if any revisions need to be made to the above text messages.

Thanks,
Mary

	Subject:	

	In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

	This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

Kim

It would cost approximately $515,000 to build all the necessary interconnect facilities to deliver gas to Questar at this location( please see attached ""B"" release from Engineering-Roswell). Since TW is constructing this project for Questar we need to add 31.16 % tax gross-up and that will make a total  cost of $ 675,427 for the project.

Again your previous cost of $702,000 , mentioned in the agreement with Questar, is fine because even ""B"" release cost estimates are approximately 15% ?.

If you any questions please call me at anytime.

Regards,
Mansoor

Subject:	Questar San Juan Hub Interconnect

All,

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a ""Payment Plan"" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.  

We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.  After execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.

Thanks, 
Kim    713-853-3098

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.
Randy

It's my understanding that Transwestern currently has firm deliveries at the Lonestar Ward Co I/C which is bi-directional.  Lonestar is planning on conveying the line to Sid Richardson who will turn the line into a sour gas line.  As a result deliveries (&/or receipts) will no longer be made.   The Lonestar Ward Co I/C, is currently listed as a 311 point.    Upon Lonestar's conveyance of the line to Sid Richardson, the abandonment of the I/C point would be reported to FERC in the annual 311 Report only if ground disturbance would occur in abandoning Transwestern's facilities.

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.

I am not certain that Susan has been made aware of where and which spaces have been allocated to her (Eric Gadd's group) with respect to the move.  In effort to make sure that no one falls through the crack, would you please coordinate with Susan as to which floor and specifically which cubical/office locations she can slot her people in.  Susan will also coordinate Steve Dowd with the rest of Eric's group in the move so we need to keep a space for him.  

Susan,

Kevin,

As a follow up to our recent discussions concerning the SoCalGas RLS or
peaking rate, I am forwarding to you the proposed decision of ALJ Brown.  My
understanding is that at yesterday's Commission meeting the Commission made
a decision to approve a change to the current peaking rate tariff.  I should
have their decision within a couple working days.  I am forwarding their
draft decision.

The expected PD rate design for the new peaking rate would include SFV rate
design principals, demand charges determined over highest recorded usage
over a 12 month period, and inclusion of public purpose program charges.  At
this point we'll call it a modified cost of service approach.

If you have any questions, please call.

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.  

Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.

Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.  

As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Questions or concerns????

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

CD Language Solutions, 713-661-9553, email: languagesolutions@prodigy.net

mellis.sanford@enron.com (can't find her number); she teaches Spanish at Enron

interlingua - Muriel Dupont # 713-957-2040

Carlos Varela #281-646-9754 (phone and fax), email is:  cvarela7@yahoo.com

If you are interested in using one these options I suggest we get a price quote first.  Since these people are scattered about in Houston, they like to do things over email if files are electronically available.  If not, I recommend using a courier service - such as City Central at 713-623-0303 (never had a problem with them).

If you have any questions or need any additional information please let me know.

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides billing information for July 2001 reservation invoices.  

Please be advised that the PG&E (Core) releases exceeded the maximum tariff rate as summarized below (the first three were special calculations based on index spreads and the last one was a fixed rate):

PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation           60,000/day * 31 days * $0.7081 = $1,317,066.00 
Sempra Energy Trading Corp.                           15,000/day * 31 days * $1.9951 = $   927,721.50 
Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.                                  50,000/day * 31 days * $0.7468 = $1,157,540.00

Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC        25,000/day * 31 days * $1.1600 = $  899,000.00

These amounts will be billed to the acquiring shippers and once payments are received, PG&E will subsequently receive reimbursement.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

 

Thanks,

Elizabeth

The missing information is the Dandby section from the Asset Binder.  It had a grey card-stock cover.  We can certainly keep a copy but they need the original back.  With all of the paper floating around the tables, it is likely to have been mixed up with some copies that were given to us.  Anyway, please check your stuff and see if this got in there.

"Declined: Meeting w Aquila and Steve thru Lunch","
Mark,  thanks for the notice of this meeting.  I'm glad you will be attending.  FYI, the Aquila folks purchased USGT from Nanci MacKenzie about 18 months ago and I'm not sure how they have incorporated the USGT organization into the Aquila organization.  Since you are the new kid, perhaps you can inquire as to the differences in these shops so that you can effectively deal with both organizations.  I'm not sure we've ever been clear on this.  Please continue to talk about Red Rock with these folks.  What would Aquila like to see TW offer?  What are their thoughts about the West markets?  What could TW do to get Aquila to be more active on our pipe? 

FYI, I am coming into the office Wed morning.  I will be in EB4179.  I need to meet with Martha and pack up this office.  I should be in by 9:00.  If your schedule permits, perhaps you and I could meet for a few minutes on Agave before your 10:00 Aquila meeting?

I'll call you when I get in.  

Thanks, Kim.

Subject: FW: A&M Football Scare



Texas A&M football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown powdery substance on the
practice field. Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while
the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the
FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually
the goal line.  Practice resumed when the FBI agents decided that the team
was not likely to encounter the substance again.


Ha! Ha!

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

Please plan to attend a meeting regarding TW's Order 637 filing immediately following Steve's staff meeting on Monday, March 24.  We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting.

Kim

The in-service date of May 1, will be very difficult to attain. Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other). These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect. Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations. 
The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP. 
We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002. 
If you have questions or issues, please let me know.


Thanks

Earl,

We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.

Thanks, Kim.

All,

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a ""Payment Plan"" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.  

We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.  After execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.

Thanks, 
Kim    713-853-3098

Gosh, I am so sorry we have not connected yet.  I have been on a fast run.  How early in the morning do you come in?  Do I need to be at my desk?  How late in the evening are you in? 

I will make time for you.  Thanks for your persistence.

Hi Kim,

	I'd like to schedule 10 mintues of your time so we can adjust your Business Objects file locations to the new ETS Marketing standard configuration.  When's a good time for you?  I'm available except between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday.  I'd like to help you complete this configuration as soon as possible.


Thanks,

Thanks Tiny. Kim and Darrell let us know how you want to do this and we'll move forward. If we can get some kind of agreement put together with Citizens on what they need maybe we can do these changes one time. As you know we have had a lot of issues with them since start up.

Subject:	Griffith Interconnect Pressure

I'm going to try and clear this up:

Robert Francen (928-226-2219) with Citizens called about the Griffith interconnect a couple of weeks ago.  He made a request that we configure our flow control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pressure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to check with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was that by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to switch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pressure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutting TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I called and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in agreement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going to communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm not sure how to handle his request at this point.  

Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pressure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dramatically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ourselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then getting into competing issues with El Paso.  

I do not care how we configure this point.  However, again it could have implications for marketing and gas control so, I prefer that you all make that call.

us
take his car out and then I'll drive it back on Thursday (he, Lora Lee,
Ivy
and an aunt are heading off to a B & B in the hill country after the
meeting).  I'd almost rather do that than chance the Lexus'
transmission,
given how jumpy it was when I drove it over the weekend.

Besides, I don't think we could fit three persons' luggage in the trunk

the Volvo.

If you would just coordinate an assortment of pizza's, that would be great.  I believe Morgan may have a couple of people in his group who are vegetarians, so we should keep this in mind when making some of the selections.

	How about a meeting?  I'm not sure how long I've known you but I know I've liked you since the first day.  You're a smart, capable Account Manager but we seem to be developing friction.  I know we both want the same thing; deals to go out as quickly and smoothly as possible... so where's our problem? It seems from my side (which could very well be WRONG) that we're constantly going over procedures, how the process works and what information I need... stuff everyone should know.  Maybe I'm wrong but it's very frustrating.  Maybe it's because NNG's system is automated and it's just harder to do TW deals.  Maybe it's because procedures weren't followed after Christine left and we've had to do lots of work to try and catch back up.  The Deal Capture team was also suppose to get a 3rd team member so it's VERY difficult to process all the NNG deals and TW deals at the end of each month... I think we did 75 deals in the last 4 days of October.  Let me know if you're available to talk this week... afternoons are best for me.

Great draft Maria.  I couldn't resist adding some stuff.  Remember Kathy's transcript correction?

The correction added ""on the same page"" to the ""same platform"" concept.  I inserted a paragraph that suggested that the Indicated Shippers aren't sure what the hell they want and keep changing their story so should be ignored.  Cut it if you like but it was amusing.

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
3.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.

Subject: 

Dear Colleague,

The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California
Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is
available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com
<http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on
the paper.

Here is a summary of the paper:

        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter
electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public
Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring
competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and
more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy
suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.

        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April
1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster
for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.
Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable
concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity
industry. 

        Although a few states have decided, based on the California
experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.
Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are
that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for
California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and
prices affect market outcomes.

        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity
regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred
beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance
to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity
industry. This section makes several points: 

*	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new
generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned
to meet growing loads. 

*	Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural
gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,
maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large
regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. 

*	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and
voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale
markets). 

*	Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with
artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to
offer retail services without favoring individual competitors. 

*	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply
and price risks. 

*	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,
ancillary services, and transmission congestion. 

*	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and
vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and
transmission). 


        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and
prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer
efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve
reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing
options. 

        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is
turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because
electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is
our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy
to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a
real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the
same time. 

        Although the problems that have occurred in California are
substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should
focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and
accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to
recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond
the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and
wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to
have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces
time varying prices. 

        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for
wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will
enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and
price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability
services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,
and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants
will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Sounds like we will be dealing with Rodger Swenke and not Bob Betonte or Richard Ishiwaka on GISB issues from now on.  Does anyone know Rodger or know what his duties are at Socal Gas?

Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,

It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to 
support Bob's participation in our organization.

The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke, Senior 
Pipeline Products Project Manager, SoCal Gas, to take the open seat on the 
EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob 
for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with 
SoCal Gas.     

Best Regards,  Rae

"RE: SJ Pipe Settling","Steve, 

Darrell informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned outage next week for two days.  We will talk with their commercial folks on Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop.  We anticipate that we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead with their September business as usual.  We will also talk with the other SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down the lateral while Burlington is down.  

Thanks, Kim.

The effect will be to the Burlington (low pressure) system only.   We can still flow 800 mmcfd down the lateral, we will just need to make up the low pressure volumes recieved from Burlington through the high pressure customers.  I've discussed with Darryl....

Today Burlington is flowing approximately 130 mmcfd.  Limited to 800 mmcfd down the lateral due to Gallups condition.

Importance:	High

A conf. call has been set up for Monday morning 9:00 a.m. CST to discuss a force majeure situation on the #3 unit at the San Juan Compressor Station.  877-795-3687 pin 475577 

Overview:  (for those uninvolved to date)
     In a walk through of the San Juan Station with the Team Thursday evening 8/16 it was noted that severe settling issues on yard piping existed.  The Team had been working with Engineering on developing an action plan to address over the last several months.  Upon a visual inspection we requested that the Team contact a local contractor and have the pipe cover (dirt) removed immediately to allow the piping to relieve itself.  This would provide the necessary time to follow up with Engineering and attain feedback on the status of the project and implement remedies.  The Team had a contractor on location the following Monday 8/20, and work removing the cover was completed this Monday 8/27.  However, the expected results were not achieved.  In other words the piping did not spring back to the degree that pipe stress concerns were eliminated.  We requested that a structural engineer be sent to the site immediately to evaluate the integrity of the piping.  He was on location Thursday morning (8/29).  In a phone conversation with Phil Dickenson (Trigon structural engineer) he mentioned that his immediate concern was how this much displacement could not induce high stresses.  However, no pipe coating cracks were visible so he wanted an opportunity to input the data in a model and evaluate prior to making any recommendations.  He did offer, that at a minimum, we stand a good chance of exceeding the .5 design factor, but without reviewing the data further he would not commit to a conclusion.  We asked that he work through the evening, if required, to provide the necessary information with regards to the pipes integrity.   While waiting on Trigons report, we notified the Team and asked that they contact Foutz & Bursham (local pipeline contractor) and get an evaluation from them on the estimated down time it would require in a worst case scenario to make the repairs/replacements.  (4 to 5 days)  We then requested that the Roswell CDC (Ernie DeLosSantos) determine the availability of approximately 150"" of X42 356 wall 10"" pipe, 12 ea. Y42  365 wall 90's, and 1 ea. Y42 365 wall 45.  (all material is available at Redman Supply in Farmington)  

Conclusion:    
     Mr. Dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us that we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels.  The stress levels calculated by Dickinson were in excess of yield as follows:  1.09% of SMYS at the connection between the recycle/surge line and the discharge header, and 1.01% of SMYS at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10"" recycle line.    His recommendation was that the piping be cut and re-welded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe supports, not subject to subsidence, be provided.

     Conference calls with Engineering (Spalding, Eisenstein, Rance, Pebdani, Minnoti ???) were set up to review the data with Mr. Dickenson and it was decided to have Greg McIlwain on location Monday in conjunction with Mike McCracken to initiate the necessary repairs.  After much discussion with Dickenson with regards to the modeling performed, Engineering indicated that the system is Operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early next week when repairs are made.  The repairs will be isolated to the #3 unit only so, the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days (48 hours).  However, furhter evaluation by McIlwain will confirm timelines.  

If anyone has questions through the weekend prior to Mondays call, I can be reached at 520-853-3253.

Planes, fires, and floods along with my inability to use the stairs as a means of escape plus her desire to be ""back on the ground"" again add up to our moving into a one story patio styled home in a neighborhood just a couple of miles east of San Antonio !
Just joking about the location. . .It's off I-10 at Eldridge.

Closing on that property will be the first few days of December. Closing on The Spires is not known just yet. As far as actually moving out, we hope to be in the new place before December 23.  I would like to make a ""transfer of positions"" before Thanksgiving.

TK - What happened to the Posted IT Rates that were on TW's website?  If no longer posted, then why?  And if this is the case, then I will need to modify the Transactional Report which is supposed to link to this website.  Please let me know.

Also, because of the new FERC reporting requirements for California deliveries, we need to ensure that all rates (discounted or negotiated) are promptly updated daily in CBS rates (prior to 10:30am for next gas day) so that we don't have any discrepancies between the FERC monthly report and the Transactional Report.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

What process needs to be followed in order to request a payment to be made to ENA per the terms of the agreement negotiated with Marketing when capacity is released on their behalf?  Please let everyone in the distribution know so they can follow these same procedures for next month as well.

Additionally, do we code the marketing fee revenues to a different account from the transportation revenues and how?

Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Yes, it does mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we can contract for on PNM--however, we have to use the capacity in accordance with our tariff and rates meaning if the PNM capacity is subject to recall (which I thought was the Commission's concern in the PNM order last year) then we can't use that capacity to sell firm service (not subject to recall) on our system.  I don't think we are relieved of our reporting requirements either that were required in the PNM order.  Maria--please comment if you think I have interpreted this incorrectly.

Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.

"Blanco Hub Schematic","Gaylen and Jodi,

Here is the schematic for the Blanco Hub, it has not been updated for your new interconnect yet.  

Gaylen, I got your voice mail on amending the payment schedule if you guys are purchasing most of the equipment and I am OK with amending it to reflect the change in spending.  I've got a draft that I will update for the spending.  I'll send it to you soon.  

By the way, do you guys have a list of the customers that will be attending your customer meeting next week?  I am scheduled for the second session.

Thanks, Kim.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Would you have some time today or tomorrow to discuss this?  Also, we should rally with Kevin Hyatt to discuss his ideas on Sun Devil and determine if we can use a similar strategy for Trans Pecos.

Subject:	Financing Arrangements

Kim:
I was hoping to catch up with you after Stan's meeting to discuss TW financing arrangements.  Their is still a very good possibility that TW could be added to the Cpt. 11 companies sometime in early Jan. (the Revolving Credit Agreement would be paid off as part of that process).  Two things to remember on new projects - (i) likelihood of TW cash for equity in deal is very low and (ii) If TW is put into Cpt. 11, the implications of its credit on the other counterparties.  If we can find other people's money and structure around the TW credit risk, we have a better chance (but still will be extremely tough).  As you heard this morning, cash is at a very high premium right now (especially with Red Rock expansion).

Thanks,

Kevin

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Terrific news that the meeting with EOG went well last Friday.  I will speak to Mark Kraus (EOG Commercial) to recap, in case he was not aware of the results.  An invoice needs to be sent to them for the equipment we have already ordered.  My preference is for them to pay prior to any installation.  And, of course we want to inspect everything before we pull our equipment out on September 1.  You also had a question about the Interconnect and Operating Agreement... one had already been executed last August stating Enron will operate and EOG will own.  Thanks.

Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated flow I was showing on the outage report was 130 mmcfd, (per Eric Faucheaux Planning) and the actual affect is 180 mmcfd.

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/01 to 12/01/01) Darrell is going to post something on it today.

I also had a WT2 outage on the report that the field was asking for. It showed a complete Station shut down for 24 hours. Darrell and I talked the field into moving it to next year. (Early March) If you have any questions let me know.

Subject:	RE: FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points

As I understand/interpret the Gallup contract, we can completely avoid electrical power demand charges (approximately $42,000 per month) if we do not run the unit during the power utilities peak power period.  If we can not shut down the unit, we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period.

Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day (5-7 PM), Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day.  Through access to Tri-States history data, I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be.  I can look at the current day's usage and estimate if today's peak will be higher than the higher of (1) my estimated peak or (2) the actual peak so far this month.  If so, the ""Probability today is a peak"" will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today.   The ""Probability now is peak"" approached 100 when an actual peak is underway.  The Tri-State Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway.

Note that it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak.  If the first day of the month has an estimated peak 1000 and last years peak for the same month, was 985.  It appears possible that this will be a power peak day.  Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was 1010.  Now on the second day of the month, the estimated peak is 965, not likely to be a power peak day.  The third day has an estimated peak of 1005, a possible power peak day.  If the actual for the third day is 1012, it now becomes the new peak for the month.  If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below 1012, they are not likely to be power peaks, and unit turndown is not required.

The point is, to completely avoid demand charges, we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month, and also on the third day.  The utility integrates their peak over a 30 minute period, thus the minimum time the unit could be down.  I'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month.

So far this month, I guessed a power peak on 10/1/01 starting at 20:18 and ending at 21:05.  The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was 10/1/01 starting at 20:30 lasting to 21:00.


I'm sorry for any confusion.  I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators.  If there are any additional questions, do not hesitate to call me at 87-7546.

Subject:	FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points



We have added some point to the Scada database that are provided to us
by Gary Choquette's Peak Power Predictor.  His message below describes
their function better than I would.

I've listed the points below with their descriptions, alarm value(s) and
comment.

Although these points are listed with the other Analog/Discrete points,
they are not coming from the field RTU.  They will act like normal
points so it's easy to put them together.  For those using the intranet
""Adhoc"" reports, they will show up on that.  The key is that the
Discretes that we receive from Gary all end in "".CC"" and the Analogs end
in "".SC"".  We also try to include the (CLC) in the description to depict
that the information is coming from the Closed Loop Control Systems.


Register	Description				Alarm Value
Gary's Comments

GALP.1901.CC	Tri-State Data Old - site Unavail (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Alarm 		(can not retrieve data from Tri-States site)
GALP.1902.CC	Tri-State Calc Off-Line / Data Error (CLC) 	0 =
Normal, 1 = Alarm 		(utility is off-line or error in the
data)
GALP.1903.CC 	Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Peak 		(a power peak is currently in progress)

GALP.7901.SC	Probability % Today is Peak (CLC)     HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that today is likely to be a power
peak day.
GALP.7902.SC  Probability % Now is Peak (CLC)       HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that a power peak is active now.
GALP.7903.SC	Peak Time (hour.min) (CLC)

I believe this approach allows TW to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financial risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release them from their contract obligations without penalty.  

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance that a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came from.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that  ""capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons including contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity.""  If the questioning customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, the confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants more detail, is that ""Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business and terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract termination subject to an indemnity or ""keep whole"" mechanism."" 

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow up on this later today.  DF

I am assuming these were the last contracts.  They are the last ones I was forwarded any how.  None the less, my top two concerns Today:

I assume we are going to compare the predicted economics to the actual economics then look at alternatives to options in Sun Devil (Like a GE turbine)  I've got an idea of what we can do for the fuel portion of this deal if we do look at turbines.
One of the issues dicussed in detail before we did this project with ECS was WHY is TW doing a deal with ECS versus a stand alone deal.  If I remember correctly, the pitch to FERC was that TW did not have the expertise to facilitate a peak avoidance alone.  Mary Kay Miller should remember these details...

Perry - We lost you on the original e-mail but definitely need your involvement.

Kim - Would you or someone in the TW commercial group be interesting in attending this meeting?
It's Monday, 1-2 PM.  Location to be determined.

Other Invitees include: Glen Hass, Mary Draemer (Ramona isn't available), Toby Kuehl, Darrel Schoolcraft (out of office), Maria Pavlou,
Ranelle Paladino & Rita Bianchi, 


From original meeting notice:
Are all of you available to discuss the changes to the Operationally Available Capacity report that the Commission is requiring of TW?  In case you haven't heard, FERC has specifically stated that TW needs to add a column to its Operationally Available Capacity report to capture day to day available sustainable capacity .  We would like to discuss how to get this changed within the 15 day timeframe that we were given.  This is a separate issue from the new California report that all pipelines serving California have to do by Sept. 30th.

Ramona, can you locate a room for this discussion?  Omaha will be in 7C1 extension 7017.  If anyone else needs to be included in this discussion, please invite them.  Thanks.

Subject: TW Capacity Affected for Red Rock Tie-ins 
The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result from tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assemblies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubbers will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the station yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjacent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line will produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respective horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

Subject:	CEC Infrastructure Report

The California Energy Commission has issued its final report on the California Infrastructure which is to be voted upon by the Commision on Wednesday.  Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report (123 pages).  There's an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages.  Although, as stated in the summary, the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices, they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices.  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter.  I'll keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting.  gh



IN NEW REPORT, CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY
Constrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas
prices in California last fall and winter, according to a report issued last week by a committee of the
California Energy Commission. The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the
issue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state.
After taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others,
the report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved. ?Insufficient receipt capacity
within California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso [Natural Gas Co.] pipeline system both contrib-uted
to the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000,? the Sept. 24 report said. The CEC is
scheduled to vote Wednesday on the report.
The revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame
entirely on that, noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels
during times of high gas prices. ?As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California,
buyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other. Whether prices during this period were, in
whole or in part, the result of a free market?s rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium, or
entirely the result of price manipulation, is beyond the scope of this report,? wrote Commissioner Michal
Moore, presiding member of CEC?s electricity and natural gas committee.
Pointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint (RP00-241) against El Paso Corp. pending at FERC, the
CEC added that it had ?every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented
by the CPUC.?
The report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El
Paso system in recent years. ?The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California, and not the upstream
customers. This is due, in part, to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to
firm capacity on the El Paso system. It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment
to deliver capacity paid for by California,? the report noted.
Moore?s committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version
from the CPUC, The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co., which all called for
consideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California (IF, 27 Aug,
1). The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the
range of 15% to 20% (IF, 13 Aug, 4).
The report went on to suggest that California ?can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a
regulated, cost-plus environment. Under price regulation, adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme
temperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes. Under today?s conditions, that is no longer the case.?
Moore added that the state?s ?virtual complete reliance? on gas for electric generation has contributed to
the new dynamics surrounding capacity planning.
More than 100,000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council
region demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid, the report continued, saying the CEC was ?encour-aged?
by recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERC?s stated intent to expedite
review of such proposals. The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co. is developing 375,000 Mcf/
day of additional receipt capacity, which should be ready by the end of the year. Also, Pacific Gas and Electric
Co. plans to add as much as 600,000 Mcf/day of capacity by 2003, according to the report.
It observed that intrastate pipelines, in particular those in Southern California, ran at close to full
capacity at times this and last year, which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate
pipelines to gas consumers, including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001.
High prices in the future could be held at bay with the in-state expansions and the CPUC?s recent approval
of SoCal Gas? plan to remove 37 Bcf of cushion and working gas from three storage fields in Montebello and
Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles County and La Goleta in Santa Barbara County (IF, 2 July, 3).
In addition to strongly emphasizing intrastate needs, the report recommended that the state ?analyze
the consequences of the increasing upstream gas demands on the El Paso pipeline system as they affect the
flows of natural gas and electricity? between California and the Southwest U.S. and Mexico.
According to the report, the state also should: encourage in-state gas production; re-evaluate design criteria
for the intrastate system in consideration of growing power generation demand; consider gas curtailment
mechanisms; ?optimize? storage; and encourage the creation of new storage facilities in the state.
The 123-page report is available on the CEC?s Web site (www.energy.ca.gov/reports/index.html).

We have agreement among the Regulatory Group and the Planning Group that the way the NNG unsubscribed reports are showing points currently is the way we would like to continue to show them.  Specifically, we would include all physical points that are valid for transport but would not include farm taps.  We would also not include non-physical points (such as zone points) except for Demarc.

The only question I had was on TW with respect to the ""new"" point established for the precedent agreements on the Red Rock expansion.  I wouldn't want to show both the physical points with the associated capacity and the ""new"" point with the same associated capacity (I don't know if this is the case, that was just the only unusual item we could think of on TW).

Call if I have further confused the issue.

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.

FYI,

 8/08/01, is the next Outage Coordination Commercial Review meeting.  There will be a few changes to the monthly meeting. First, you will see the name has changed. The change was made to help maintain our focus of the meeting. Which is review the outages where flows are affected and discuss their impact with the Commercial groups. The meeting will focus mainly on outages that have some throughput loss. If you have any questions or concerns please give me a call.  

Thank you

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Subject:	Sun Devil Open Season Results --CONFIDENTIAL--

Overall, the results from Thursday's open season on our Sun Devil Project were very favorable (see below).  Contract terms ranged from two to sixteen years.

San Juan 	84% subscribed	at targeted transport rate
Phoenix		97% subscribed	at nearly targeted transport rate
Cal Border	77% subscribed	at 61% of targeted transport rate

We obviously have some work to do on the California piece but overall, the market interest supports our efforts to move forward with all due haste to the next level.  With that in mind, we'll begin working on the next steps below:

Next steps-
	 - Finalize Level A hydraulic study (9/7)
- Prepare Level B estimate  (9/30)
	- Schedule on-site ROW reviews (9/10)
- Schedule briefing session with FERC in September
- Issue press release on open season results (week of 9/3)
- Mobilize commercial teams to firm up contracts (week of 9/3)

For now, please regard this memo as highly confidential.  We appreciate everyone's support and hard effort thus far--  now the real fun begins!  Look for more info to follow soon and regularly scheduled project update meetings to begin in September.  

Please call me with any questions / concerns at 853-5559.

Subject:	TW Capacity Affected for Red Rock Tie-ins 

The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result from tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assemblies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubbers will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the station yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjacent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line will produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respective horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

Tie-in	Schedule/Duration	Capacity	X-over Status
CS 2 ML	Oct '01 / 4 days	960 MMcfd	MLV 3010-open us/ds x-over; open us 30"" x-over

August 27, 2001

Dear Participant:

It is our pleasure to welcome you to the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program on October 31 - November 2 at the Doubletree - Travis 1&2 .  The program is designed to help leaders develop the skills necessary to manage direct reports.  The program focuses on participative management skills and has leaders and their reports working together to shape goals, standards, and operating procedures, that I believe you will find both relevant and enjoyable.

Program Details

The program will begin at 8:30 a.m. each day and end at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the first 2 days and at 3:00 p.m. on the third day.  Dress is informal.

Because of the full program schedule, there will be no time for regular business contacts.  Therefore, we ask that you clear your calendar for the 3 days and make arrangements for someone to cover your phone calls.

Preparation Materials

Enclosed is the Preparation Materials booklet that you should read over and bring to the program.

Distributing the Enclosed Questionnaires

As part of your preparation for the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program, you will also be distributing the enclosed questionnaires to your direct reports.  Many leaders spend a lot of time trying to figure out what their direct reports are thinking.  To help answer that question, one of the key components of this program is a confidential survey of your direct report's perceptions of your management skill.  The survey will help you to identify your strengths and determine areas in need of improvement.  You are the only person who will see the survey results, unless you decide to share them.

Distribute one of the enclosed questionnaires to each of the seven direct reports that you have selected.  You may wish to hand deliver each questionnaire so that you can personally explain its purpose.  In doing so you should emphasize that:

The reason you are asking him or her to fill out the questionnaire is to improve the quality of communication and effectiveness of work that transpires between you.

His or her responses are strictly confidential. (The survey report that you will see at the program will be the combined results of all your direct reports.)

The completed questionnaire must be received by the Forum Corporation for scoring no later than October 24th. Please allow 2 weeks for the questionnaire to travel through postal system.

The questionnaire instructions explain that the direct report must fill in the level he or she feels is required in each dimension and the level he or she feel you have attained.

I am confident that your direct reports will be happy to oblige.  The questionnaire should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Please note that a feedback report can only be generated for you when you use the questionnaire that I have assigned to you.  Should you or your direct reports misplace a questionnaire do not use a colleague's ""extras"" or photocopy questionnaires.  The questionnaires that have been assigned to you have a unique coding number which has been assigned specifically for you in order to create a custom feedback report.  The questionnaires assigned to you cannot be duplicated or modified in any valid way without my knowledge.  If you need replacement questionnaires for any reason, please see me and I will provide you with any extra questionnaires you may require.

I look forward to your participation in the program and know you will find it to be an interesting and rewarding experience.  If any questions remain unanswered, give me a call.

Sincerely,

DIRECTIONS FROM LISA:

Hello Everyone-  Here are detailed directions to the beach cabin for the
Nov. 30  girl's weekend.


Directions to the Polk Beach Cabin:

Go south on IH-45.

Take the Harborside Dr. exit when you get to Galveston and turn left
under the highway (this is the first exit after crossing the causeway,
so be watching for it).

Travel approx. 6 miles on Harborside Dr. to Ferry Rd.

Turn left on Ferry Rd., go to the end, and catch the ferry to Bolivar (
this is a free drive-on ferry operated by the Texas Hwy Dept.).

After exiting the ferry you will be on Bolivar Peninsula Hwy 87.  Travel
approximately 11.5 miles to the Emerald II edition (the Crystal Beach
water tower is a good land mark when you are getting close and the
Emerald II edition is the first road after the post office).

Turn right into Emerald II (there is a small green sign).  After
entering, turn left on Flamingo, and follow the curve around to
Eastview.  The cabin is on the right about half way down and is located
on the corner of Eastview and Crestview.  The address is 919 Eastview
and ""J.S. Polk"" is written on the side.

The telephone # is 409-684-0195.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone!!

Obviously we have called all our day-to-day contacts about the ongoing Internet situation.  I believe that we have been able to accomodate all nominations, even if by fax.  Since this is going on for the second day, I thought you may want to give a heads up to your marketing contacts.  If you hear of other companies that are having similar problems please let me know.

When I think of some of the folks who exemplify what Transwestern Pipeline is..... who's character Transwestern Pipeline was built on..... I just have a hard time  imagining Transwestern Pipeline without Kim Watson and Steve Harris.  

I am also so envious of you all.... (I'm turning green..Ha!)  I had serious hopes that KMI (Mrs. McDonald) would make a serious run at TW, but now, well we shall have to see.  If you all ever need a hard working, simple minded, trouble making, but dedicated field ops manager .... give me a call.   

I'm going to miss your enthusiasm.

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Subject:	 Update from the Socal Meeting

	
FYI, here is an update from our meeting today,	

I did some checking to follow up on the Socal Window issue discussed in the meeting  today with our TMS IT team and Mary Draemer to find out the exact date when we implemented the EDI Socal Capacity Window. It was implemented on April 27, 2000. Socal began sending us the window volume via EDI at this time. Prior to this date, they faxed it to TW and the reps. would load that volume into the capacity system for the Socal point. Linda Ward thinks that we have the old fax documents saved in the file room.

Mary and I also called the EDI Hub team to find out how far back they store our EDI files. Currently the EDI Hub keep six months of data then the archive it. We could get to that date if needed. They would be a charge involved to pull archived data.

Wayne on the TMS team will also check to see if this information is replicated to adhoc (meaning we keep a complete history), or if it is not replicated (meaning we only keeps six months of data).

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Thanks Ramona

It's Monday, 1-2 PM.  Location to be determined.

Other Invitees include: Glen Hass, Mary Draemer (Ramona isn't available), Toby Kuehl, Darrel Schoolcraft (out of office), Maria Pavlou,

From original meeting notice:
Are all of you available to discuss the changes to the Operationally Available Capacity report that the Commission is requiring of TW?  In case you haven't heard, FERC has specifically stated that TW needs to add a column to its Operationally Available Capacity report to capture day to day available sustainable capacity .  We would like to discuss how to get this changed within the 15 day timeframe that we were given.  This is a separate issue from the new California report that all pipelines serving California have to do by Sept. 30th.

Ramona, can you locate a room for this discussion?  Omaha will be in 7C1 extension 7017.  If anyone else needs to be included in this discussion, please invite them.  Thanks.

You might want to send these to Kim 

Some brief comments:

1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period of at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiration date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before the expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as this is optionality without any cost to them. 
2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to establish an ""Initial Recourse Rate"" prior to the open season in order for their proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the ""proportionate reduction"" requested. 

We need to get Paul Cherry working on the credit of MGI Supply ASAP.

This make sense to me, but please make sure you are OK with the final position now reflected in the Caminus system.  

Thanks, Kim.

Rudy,

Per your request, I have removed the 10,000/d of natural long fuel positions that were in Caminus for anticipatory hedges that were initially hedged with RMTC before those deals were terminated.  This reduced the VaR on the TW fuel book from $841k to $421K.  I did not remove the natural long position that was physically contracted (10,000/d) from Caminus.  To summarize, we had 20,000/d of natural long, 20,000 was swapped to a fix price, and 10,000 was physically contracted to perfect the fixed price hedges.  All 20,000/d of the swaps were with RMTC and were terminated.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Kim!   I hadn't quite made it through all of my e-mails, when I looked at Stan's Monday calendar and realized I didn't have a location for this meeting, so I called you to inquire.    Sorry for the oversight.

...in fact, would you consider taking this Friday off from work?  I just

see him......and we could catch the CFA show, too...

	Williams Launches uE Web Site For Cross Commodity Pricing 
	Tulsa-based Williams on Monday launched uE, a cross-commodity price index for both spot and future energy prices, as a companion to its web-based EnergyNewsLive.com. Similar to the Dow Jones for equity markets, the Williams uE will offer an equivalent benchmark for the overall price of energy, measuring the price average of eight individual commodities: electricity, natural gas, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, ethane, propane, residual fuel and jet fuel. 
	The site includes information on pricing trends including a national spot uE, forward uE, regional uE, commodity quotes, as well as daily, weekly and monthly commentary. Included on the site is EnergyPulse, which will feature Dr. Dennis O'Brien, director of energy and policy at the University of Oklahoma. EnergyPulse now airs every Friday on Williams' EnergyNewsLive site, and offers an analysis of trends in energy pricing and the impact the economy has on energy. 
	Williams uE was introduced a year ago when EnergyNewsLive debuted, and Williams said it has tested and refined the site for the company's own market activity. It also has been reviewed by the Energy Information Administration, said Williams. To view the site, visit www.williams-ue.com.
