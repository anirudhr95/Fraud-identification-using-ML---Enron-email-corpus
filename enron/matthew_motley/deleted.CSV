   Word of the Day for Wednesday March 6, 2002:

   frisson \free-SOHN\, noun:
   A  moment  of  intense  excitement;  a  shudder;  an emotional
   thrill.

     When  we  think  a  story  hasn't been invented, there's an
     extra frisson in reading it.
     --""Too true,"" [1]Independent, April 12, 1998

     As   every   parent   knows,   children  have  a  love-hate
     relationship  with  stories  about  monsters. They love the
     frisson  of  hearing about such terrifying creatures as the
     Cyclops  --  but  hate to think about what they might do if
     they bumped into one.
     --""Strange   but  true:  One  in  the  eye  for  all  those
     Homer-phobes,"" [2]Daily Telegraph, June 21, 1998

     When  we  stopped  in traffic at the Plaza de la Cibeles on
     the  Paseo del Prado, where a grandiose 18th-century statue
     of  the  goddess of fertility poised on a chariot seemed to
     be  waiting  for  the  light to change, a little frisson of
     pleasure  jolted  through  me,  because this part of Madrid
     reminded me of Paris.
     --""Counting  Pesetas  in  Madrid,"" [3]New York Times, March
     17, 1996
     _________________________________________________________

   Frisson  comes  from  the  French,  from Old French fri?on, ""a
   trembling,"" ultimately from Latin frigere, ""to be cold.""

   Word of the Day for Monday March 25, 2002:

   farrago \fuh-RAH-go; fuh-RAY-go\, noun;
   plural farragoes:
   A confused mixture; an assortment; a medley.

     Ivan Illich writes ""a farrago of sub-Marxist cliches, false
     analogies,  non  sequiturs,  false  or bent facts and weird
     prophesies.""
     --""The  Paul  Johnson  Enemies  List,""  [1]New  York Times,
     September 18, 1977

     Roy  Hattersley  will  upset  much  of  Scotland by calling
     Walter  Scott's  lvanhoe  ""a farrago of historical nonsense
     combined with maudlin romance.""
     --""Literary  classics  panned  by critics,"" [2]Independent,
     January 18, 1999

     From the moment the story of the Countess of Wessex and the
     Sheikh  of  Wapping  broke,  there  has  been  a farrago of
     rumour,  speculation  and  fantasy of which virtually every
     newspaper should be ashamed.
     --Roy  Greenslade,  ""A sting in the tale,"" [3]The Guardian,
     April 9, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Farrago  comes  from  the  Latin  farrago, ""a mixed fodder for
   cattle,""  hence  ""a medley, a hodgepodge,"" from far, a sort of
   grain.

   Word of the Day for Sunday March 31, 2002:

   gravitas \GRAV-uh-tahs\, noun:
   High seriousness (as in a person's bearing or in the treatment
   of a subject).

     At  first sight the tall, stooped figure with the hawk-like
     features   and   bloodless  cheeks,  the  look  of  extreme
     gravitas,  seems  forbidding  and  austere, the abbot of an
     ascetic   order,  scion  of  an  imperial  family  who  has
     foresworn the world.
     --John  Lehmann,  ""T.S.  Eliot  Talks About Himself and the
     Drive to Create,"" [1]New York Times, November 9, 1953

     And  we want to tell our readers about sharp, clever books,
     utterly lacking in gravitas, that we know will delight them
     on the beach or the bus.
     --Benjamin  Schwarz,  ""(Some  of)  the best books of 2001,""
     [2]The Atlantic, December 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Gravitas is from the Latin gravitas, ""heaviness, seriousness,""
   from gravis, ""heavy, serious.""

   Word of the Day for Friday March 22, 2002:

   arrogate \AIR-uh-gayt\, transitive verb:
   1.  To  claim  or  seize  without  right  or justification; to
   appropriate.
   2. To claim on behalf of another; to ascribe.

     What's  certain  is  that  another  American  President has
     arrogated  to  himself  the prerogative of dispatching U.S.
     military   personnel   on   an   overseas  combat  mission,
     disregarding  the constitutional mandate that only Congress
     may declare war.
     --""Imposing  'democracy'  in  Haiti,""  [1]The  Progressive,
     November 1, 1994

     A  measure  to abolish or radically restrict the ability of
     ministers  to  arrogate  powers  to  themselves  would be a
     necessary  adjunct  to  the  list  of  proposals  on  ""open
     government/parliament"".
     --Mike  Marqusee,  ""Stumped  for  success,  New Statesman &
     Society, January 19, 1996

     The  most  sinister  dimension of this form of 'terror' was
     that  it  became an intrinsic component of Fascist and Nazi
     governance,  executed  at  the  behest  of, and in complete
     subservience  to, the ruling political party of the land --
     which  had  arrogated  to itself complete, total control of
     the country and its people.
     --Bruce Hoffman, [2]Inside Terrorism
     _________________________________________________________

   Arrogate  comes  from  Latin adrogare, ""to take to oneself, to
   claim,"" from ad-, ""towards,"" + rogare, ""to ask.""

   Word of the Day for Saturday March 16, 2002:

   peccadillo \peck-uh-DIL-oh\, noun:
   A slight offense; a petty fault.

     No  peccadillo is too trivial: we learn that the mogul once
     blew  his  top  because  his  laundry  came  back  starched
     ("" 'Fluff and fold!' he screamed"").
     --Eric  P. Nash, ""High Concept,"" [1]New York Times, May 10,
     1998

     And  besides,  ""what  do they say? 'Don't judge lest you be
     judged.' Everybody has their peccadilloes.""
     --  ""Tyson  has  a  friend  in his corner,"" [2]Irish Times,
     October 21,1999

     Child  of  a  dominant  mother,  victim  of  a guilt-ridden
     conscience,  [St.  Augustine]  wrote  bewilderingly haunted
     'Confessions,'   in   which   infantile  peccadilloes  like
     stealing  apples  and adolescent fumblings with instinctive
     sexuality are bewailed with all the anguish of a frustrated
     perfectionist.
     --Geoffrey  Parker,  ""True  Believers,""  [3]New York Times,
     June 29, 1997
     _________________________________________________________

   Peccadillo   comes   from  Spanish  pecadillo,  ""little  sin,""
   diminutive   of  pecado,  ""sin,""  from  Latin  peccatum,  from
   peccare, ""to make a mistake, to err, to sin."" It is related to
   impeccable, ""without flaw or fault.""

"April Purchases","
We need to be prepared to purchase energy to cover West power April shorts. I propose we make purchases Tuesday AM. Are we comfortable that we know exactly what MWhrs must be covered by location? The issue, as always, is that money cannot be wired to the counterparties until detailed cash requests, including back-up (As prepared by Mo for March) is presented to the cash committee.

Mike/Matt: Are we jeopardizing our ability to effectively cover April if we wait to purchase on Wednesday AM (since Mo is out today)? I know AEP was concerned about our late buying for March. Please advise.

Thanks.

     The  tones  were  high-sounding,  mellifluous,  as  if  the

   Word of the Day for Monday February 25, 2002:

   tyro \TY-roh\, noun:
   A beginner in learning; a novice.

     It's  difficult  to  imagine  a  tyro  publishing a book on
     medical procedures or economic theory.
     --Philip  Zaleski,  ""God Help the Spiritual Writer,"" [1]New
     York Times, January 10, 1999

     He  was  a  sensitive,  fine soul alert to the pleasures of
     being  green,  a  tyro,  an amateur, unwilling to close his
     mind before it had been tempted.
     --Paul West, Sporting With Amaryllis

     And,   though   we  were  mere  tyros,  beginners,  utterly
     insignificant,  he  was  invariably as kind and considerate
     and  thoughtful,  and as lavish in the gift of his time, as
     though he had nothing else to do.
     --Leonard  Warren,  Joseph  Leidy:  The  Last  Man Who Knew
     Everything
     _________________________________________________________

   Tyro  is  from Latin tiro, ""a young soldier, a recruit,"" hence
   ""a beginner, a learner.""

   Word of the Day for Saturday March 30, 2002:

   friable \FRY-uh-buhl\, adjective:
   Easily crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder.

     Just  as  sometimes I feel that reading some of those books
     on  very friable yellow paper that come apart in your hand,
     and  come  unglued from the spine, and the print's all over
     the  page, and it seems to have been written for people who
     have  magnifying  lenses in their glasses, that's hard work
     too.
     --Angela Carter, [1]Shaking a Leg: Collected Writings

     The  house  was  so  alive  with vermin and tiny despicable
     things that it seemed no more than a shell surrounding him,
     crackling and friable and the same color in all its shadows
     as a forest.
     --Anne Rice, [2]The Vampire Armand
     _________________________________________________________

   Friable  comes  from  Latin  friabilis,  from friare, ""to rub,
   break, or crumble into small pieces.""

   Word of the Day for Friday March 1, 2002:

   prolix \pro-LIKS; PRO-liks\, adjective:
   1. Extending to a great length; unnecessarily long; wordy.
   2. Tending to speak or write at excessive length.

     It  was  a  cumbersome  book,  widely  criticized for being
     prolix in style and maddeningly circular in argument.
     --Simon  Winchester, ""Word Imperfect,"" [1]The Atlantic, May
     2001

     Montaigne  is  a  little too prolix in his determination to
     tell us almost everything that happens as he fishes his way
     across the country, and he gives us a few too many accounts
     of  the  people  he meets and of their repetitiously gloomy
     opinions.
     --Adam  Hochschild,  ""Deep  Wigglers  of the Volga,"" [2]New
     York Times, June 28, 1998

     Greenspan,  on  the other hand, is given to prolix comments
     whose   sentences   are  hung  like  Christmas  trees  with
     dependent clauses.
     --John  M.  Berry, ""Greenspan: A Man Aware of Feasibility,""
     [3]Washington Post, June 14, 1987
     _________________________________________________________

   Prolix   is   derived  from  Latin  prolixus,  ""poured  forth,
   overflowing,  extended, long,"" from pro-, ""forward"" + liquere,
   ""to be fluid.""

     Orley  had  once  been  forced to resign from a local men's
     club  for  casting  aspersions  on the character of another
     member's wife.
     --Thomas A. Underwood, Allen Tate: Orphan of the South

     love nothing better than to cast aspersions on each other's
     intellect and class loyalty.
     --Glenn Frankel, [1]Rivonia's Children

   Word of the Day for Monday March 4, 2002:

   obloquy \OB-luh-kwee\, noun:
   1. Strongly condemnatory or abusive language or utterance.
   2.  The  condition  of disgrace suffered as a result of public
   blame, abuse, or condemnation; ill repute.

     There  he  remained,  weeping  indignantly at her stream of
     obloquy,  bitterly  ashamed of his tears, until it was time
     for supper.
     --Jonathan Keates, [1]Stendhal

     Once  installed  in office he earned near-universal obloquy
     by  pushing through the biggest tax increase in the state's
     history.
     --Dan  Seligman, ""The Taxophiliacs,"" [2]Forbes, February 5,
     2001

     For  Britain  to  have  made  a  last imperial stand on the
     shores  of  the  South  China  Sea  would have risked local
     calamity and international obloquy.
     --Christopher Patten, East and West
     _________________________________________________________

   Obloquy  derives  from Latin obloqui, ""to speak against,"" from
   ob-, ""against"" + loqui, ""to speak.""

Crab Pate with Almonds 

List of Ingredients: 

1/2 cup butter 
1/2 cup chopped unblanched almonds 
1 small onion, chopped 
3 ounces cream cheese 
8 ounces backfin crab meat 
1 tablespoon brandy 
1/4 teaspoon ground mace 
salt to taste 

Preparation Instructions: 
Melt the butter over medium heat in a small skillet. When it foams, add the almonds. Turn the heat to low and saute the almonds, stirring often, until they are golden brown. Remove them with a slotted spoon and reserve. Cook the onion in the same butter, stirring often, until it is wilted and just starting to turn gold. Remove from pan. Reserve the butter. Use a processor, blender, or mortar and pestle to crush the almonds and onions to a smooth paste. In a small bowl, work the cream cheese until it is soft, then work in the almond and onion puree. Stir in the crab meat and seasonings, adding the reserved butter last. Let the pate mellow for 15 minutes or so, then taste it and adjust the salt. This pate will stay good for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator. Let it come almost to room temperature before serving, then serve with crusty French bread.

   Word of the Day for Wednesday April 10, 2002:

   pellucid \puh-LOO-sid\, adjective:
   1. Transparent; clear; not opaque.
   2. Easily understandable.

     The   prevailing   atmosphere   as   one  cruises  Kukulcan
     Boulevard, the busy strip where most of Cancun's 122 hotels
     are  clustered,  remains  that of an Orlando or a Las Vegas
     dropped intact next to pellucid Caribbean waters.
     --Larry  Rohter,  ""What's  Doing  in  Cancun.""  [1]New York
     Times, March 8, 1998

     In  her  scrupulous  and  pellucid  prose,  she  appears to
     distance herself from the optimistic Californian light.
     --Cynthia Ozick, ""What Writer's Writers Write."" [2]New York
     Times Magazine, January 2, 2000
     _________________________________________________________

   Pellucid  comes from Latin pellucidus, ""shining, transparent,""
   from  pellucere,  ""to  shine  through,"" from per-, ""through"" +
   lucere, ""to shine.""

   expatiate \ek-SPAY-shee-ayt\, intransitive verb:
   1. To speak or write at length or in considerable detail.
   2. To move about freely; to wander.

     He  had  told  her all he had been asked to tell--or all he
     meant  to  tell:  at  any  rate  he had been given abundant
     opportunity   to  expatiate  upon  a  young  man's  darling
     subject--himself.
     --Henry Blake Fuller, Bertram Cope's Year

     At  the  midday  meal  on fair day, a large one (meat loaf,
     boiled  potato,  broccoli),  Mrs. Lucas, married to the man
     with  the earache, expatiates on the difficulties of caring
     for  a  parakeet  her  daughter  has  unloaded upon her and
     which,  let  out  of  its  cage  for an airing, has escaped
     through the door suddenly opened by Mr. Lucas.
     --William H. Pritchard, Updike: America's Man of Letters

     His  relationship  with  his  family  was for many years an
     unhappy one, and he does not care to expatiate upon it.
     --Barbara  La  Fontaine, ""Triple Threat On, Off And Off-Off
     Broadway,"" [1]New York Times, February 25, 1968
     _________________________________________________________

   Word of the Day for Thursday March 21, 2002:

   logorrhea \law-guh-REE-uh\, noun:
   Excessive talkativeness or wordiness.

     By  his  own  measure,  he is a man of many contradictions,
     beginning with the fact that he is famous as a listener but
     suffers  from  ""a  touch of logorrhea."" He is so [1]voluble
     that one wonders how his subjects get a word in edgewise.
     --Mel  Gussow,  ""Listener,  Talker, Now Literary Lion: It's
     Official."" [2]New York Times, June 17, 1997

     It's also not good if your date has logorrhea.
     --Monte  Williams,  ""8  Minutes  in  the  Life  of a Jewish
     Single:  Not  Attracted? Next!"" [3]New York Times, March 5,
     2000

     Mr.  King,  who  possesses  an  enviable  superabundance of
     imagination, suffers from a less enviable logorrhea.

   Word of the Day for Saturday March 23, 2002:

   forlorn \fur-LORN; for-\, adjective:
   1. Sad and lonely because deserted, abandoned, or lost.
   2. Bereft; forsaken.
   3. Wretched or pitiful in appearance or condition.
   4. Almost hopeless; desperate.

     Henry  had  felt  guilty  at  abandoning his sister; he had
     married not once but twice, leaving Rose forlorn.
     --Anita Brookner, [1]Visitors

     In  these  forlorn regions of unknowable dreary space, this
     reservoir  of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the
     accumulation  of  centuries  of  winters,  glazed in Alpine
     heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the
     multiplied rigours of extreme cold.
     --Francis  Spufford,  [2]I  May  Be  Some Time: Ice and the
     English Imagination

     Bloch  remembers  that  Stephen  was  a  member of the Milk
     Squad,  comprised  of  children who were considered to need
     extra  nutrition,  and early photographs do show him as one
     of the smaller boys, in the front row, looking forlorn.
     --Meryle Secrest, [3]Stephen Sondheim: A Life
     _________________________________________________________

   Forlorn  comes  from Old English forleosan, ""to abandon,"" from
   for- + leosan, ""to lose.""

   To  clear  from  alleged  fault  or  guilt;  to  prove  to  be
   guiltless; to relieve of blame; to acquit.

     --Joseph  Wood  Krutch,  ""How Will Posterity Rank O'Neill?""
     [1]New York Times, October 21, 1956

     At  the  same  time,  they  said,  representatives  of  the
     inspector  general's  office  at  the  CIA  were  generally
     protective  of  the  intelligence  agents  involved  in the
     matter,  highlighting  evidence  that  seemed  to exculpate
     them.
     --Tim    Golden,    ""Guerrilla's   Asylum   Analyzed   Amid
     Contradictory Claims,"" [2]New York Times, December 12, 1996
     _________________________________________________________

   Word of the Day for Tuesday March 26, 2002:

   ratiocination \rash-ee-ah-suh-NAY-shun; rash-ee-oh-\, noun:
   The process of reasoning.

     For  all  their  vaunted  powers  of  ratiocination,  grand
     masters of chess tend to be a skittery lot.
     --""People,"" [1]Time, October 26, 1987

     The adventures of Sherlock Holmes proved so popular that it
     became  a  given that mystery tales should include a sleuth
     who  investigates a murder or other crime, and by virtue of
     intelligence,  ratiocination and perseverance solves a case
     that initially seemed unsolvable.
     --Maxim  Jakubowski, ""A beginner's guide to crime fiction,""
     [2]The Guardian, October 29, 1999

     There   is   no  question  that  Joyce  and  Nabokov. . .
     brilliantly  explored  and  expanded the limits of language
     and the structure of novels, yet both were led irresistibly
     and  obsessively  to  cap their careers with those cold and
     lifeless  masterpieces, ""Finnegans Wake"" and ""Ada,"" more to
     be  deciphered  than  read  by  a handful of scholars whose
     pleasure is strictly ratiocination.
     --""How   I   Learned  To  Stop  Worrying  And  Love  'Barry
     Lyndon,' "" [3]New York Times, January 11, 1976
     _________________________________________________________

   Ratiocination  is  from Latin rationcinatio, from ratiocinari,
   ""to compute, to calculate, to reason,"" from ratio, ""reckoning,
   calculation, reason,"" from reri, ""to reckon, to think.""

     The  processes  of  nature,  which  most  writers  extol as

     darkly by Kerouac.
     --Ellis Amburn, [2]Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of
     Jack Kerouac

     Let your deeds themselves praise you, for here I leave them
     in all their glory, lacking words to extol them.
     --Cervantes, Don Quixote de la Mancha

     Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free,

   Word of the Day for Monday March 11, 2002:

   nescience \NESH-uhn(t)s; NESH-ee-uhn(t)s\, noun:
   Lack of knowledge or awareness; ignorance.

     The  ancients  understood  that  too  much  knowledge could
     actually  impede  human  functioning -- this at a time when
     the  encroachments  on  global nescience were comparatively
     few.
     --Cullen  Murphy,  ""DNA Fatigue,"" [1]The Atlantic, November
     1997

     He  fought  on  our behalf in the war that finally matters:
     against   nescience,   against  inadvertence,  against  the
     supposition that anything is anything else.
     --Hugh  Kenner,  ""On  the Centenary of James Joyce,"" [2]New
     York Times, January 31, 1982

     The notion has taken hold that every barometric fluctuation
     must  demonstrate  climate  change. This anecdotal case for
     global warming is mostly nonsense, driven by nescience of a
     basic  point,  from  statistics  and  probability, that the
     weather is always weird somewhere.
     --Gregg  Easterbrook  ""Warming  Up,""  [3]The  New Republic,
     November 8, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Nescience  is  from  Latin  nescire,  ""not to know,"" from ne-,
   ""not""  +  scire, ""to know."" It is related to science. Nescient
   is the adjective form.

   Word of the Day for Sunday March 24, 2002:

   comport \kum-PORT\, transitive verb:
   To conduct or behave (oneself) in a particular manner.

   intransitive verb:
   To  be  fitting;  to  accord;  to agree -- usually followed by
   'with'.

     Considered  friendly  and funny in private, the queen has a
     formal,  remote air in public that some people attribute to
     shyness  and others say is a reflection of her belief that,
     as  monarch,  she  should  comport herself with dignity and
     restraint.
     --Sarah  Lyall,  ""Tradition  and Personality Keep Elizabeth
     Far  From  Her  Subjects,""  [1]New York Times, September 5,
     1997

     Her  aides comport themselves like members of a cult, their
     faces a jittery mix of adoration and fear.
     --Maureen  Dowd, ""Siamese Senators,"" [2]New York Times, May
     26, 1999

     It   comports   with   the   clear   meaning  of  the  U.S.
     Constitution.
     --""Making  War  the  Legal  Way,""  [3]Denver Rocky Mountain
     News, March 26, 1998

     Fairchild  says  he decides cases ""to comport with previous
     law and also with justice.""
     --Cary  Segall,  ""Fairchild Keeps on Judgin',"" [4]Wisconsin
     State Journal, August 1, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Comport  comes  from  Medieval French comporter, ""to conduct,""
   from  Latin  comportare,  ""to  carry, to bring together,"" from
   com-, ""with, together"" + portare, ""to carry.""

   Word of the Day for Wednesday April 3, 2002:

   probity \PRO-buh-tee\, noun:
   Complete and confirmed integrity; uprightness.

     Unless  some  light  is  shed  on  shady  dealings and some
     probity  restored,  more  young  lives will be blighted and
     careers choked off.
     --Norman Lebrecht, [1]Who Killed Classical Music?

     To  suggest  that  this  exemplar  of financial probity was
     enriching  himself  at public expense was to shake the very
     foundations of the new Republic.
     --William Safire, [2]Scandalmonger
     _________________________________________________________

   Probity  is  from Latin probitas, from probus, ""good, upright,
   virtuous.""

"All-Employee Meeting - Thursday, April 11, 8:30 a.m. (CST)","As Steve Cooper has mentioned in his voicemail messages, there will be an All-Employee Meeting this Thursday, April 11.  The meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. (CST) in the Imperial Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Unfortunately, the full ballroom was not available until late May, but we did not want to put off the meeting until then.
Capacity at the Hyatt will be limited to 1,400 people seated, with additional room for approximately 200 people standing.  As an alternative to attending the meeting, employees in Houston will be able to listen to a live audio stream and view the slide presentation on their computers at http://home.enron.com/employeemeeting/.  The question and answer portion of the meeting will not be broadcasted.  Shortly after the meeting, the audio broadcast and the slide presentation will be available for all employees at home.enron.com.
Given the current environment and continuing media interest surrounding Enron, we will take extra security precautions at the Hyatt.  Employees attending the meeting will be required to show their current photo employee badge and each badge will be crosschecked with a current employee list.  No one will be permitted into the meeting without their badge.  Due to space constraints, contract workers will not be permitted to attend the meeting.  We recognize that this security process will take time, so check-in will begin at 7:45 a.m. We apologize for any inconvenience this process creates and appreciate your understanding and patience.
We encourage you to submit questions for the meeting in advance.  Please send them via email to ""Office of the Chief Executive"".

   Word of the Day for Sunday March 3, 2002:

   celerity \suh-LAIR-uh-tee\, noun:
   Rapidity of motion or action; quickness; swiftness.

     Though  not in the best of physical form, he was capable of
     moving with celerity.
     --Malachy McCourt, [1]A Monk Swimming: A Memoir

     Furthermore,  as  is  well known, computer technology grows
     obsolete with amazing celerity.
     --Alan  S. Blinder and Richard E. Quandt, ""The Computer and
     the Economy,"" [2]The Atlantic, December 1997

     The lightning celerity of his thought processes took you on
     a  kind  of  helter-skelter  ride of surreal non-sequiturs,
     sudden  accesses of emotion and ribald asides, made all the
     more  bizarre  for  being uttered in those honeyed tones by
     the impeccably elegant gent before you.
     --""A life full of frolics,"" [3]The Guardian, May 19, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Celerity  is  from Latin celeritas, from celer, ""swift."" It is
   related to accelerate.

   Word of the Day for Thursday February 28, 2002:

   ineluctable \in-ih-LUCK-tuh-buhl\, adjective:
   Impossible to avoid or evade; inevitable.

    ... ineluctable as gravity.
     --Marilynne Robinson, [1]The Death of Adam

     California's  vision of itself as a car culture grew out of
     the  impracticality of mass transit in reaching most of its
     scenic  wonders, the innate restlessness of its inhabitants
     and the ineluctable attraction of an open road.
     --""From  the  Land  of  Private  Freeways Comes Car Culture
     Shock,"" [2]New York Times, October 16, 1997

     Linnaeus'  classification scheme became popular not because
     it captured some ineluctable truth about nature. Rather, by
     the  botanist's  own  admission, the system divided species
     based  more  on  intuition  than  science,  much  as an art
     historian might group paintings into schools.
     --""Cultivating a New Tree,"" [3]Los Angeles Times, September
     25, 1999
     _________________________________________________________

   Ineluctable  is  from  Latin  ineluctabilis, from in-, ""not"" +
   eluctari,  ""to  struggle  out of, to get free from,"" from ex-,
   e-, ""out of"" + luctari, ""to struggle.""

Lessons of Enron...The value of diversification. 

Dear Valued Customer, 

One of the harshest lessons to emerge from the $60.7 billion wipeout of Enron has been the losses suffered by Enron employees who placed too much faith - and too many of their limited retirement assets - in company stock. 

The Enron fiasco also affected millions of other Americans who encounter serious risk arising from holding too much stock in a single company. 

Searching for the lessons of Enron <http://wwwrd.0mm.com/eng063091+266998867>, Financial Engines researchers went to the data and ran thousands of simulations on portfolios with varying combinations. Their research and insights into the benefits of diversification may surprise you!

A: You should include your real estate investments in the Financial Engines Investment Advisor
 service only if they now or will some day generate income that you invest towards your retirement or if you plan to sell your real estate at some point. 

To include the investments you make from rental property income from now until your retirement: 
Click the Personal info tab, and then click Investments. Click the account and fund/stock in which you invest your rental income. The service assumes that all of these investments continue until the age you selected as your retirement age. If this income will continue in retirement, please follow the steps I explain below. 

To include rental income in retirement: 
Click the Personal info tab, and then click Benefits. In the Retirement benefits area, click Add benefit and fill in the appropriate information. 

To include the liquidation of real estate in the future during your retirement: 
Click the Personal info tab, and then click Benefits. In the Retirement benefits area, click Add benefit and fill in the appropriate information. Be sure to select one time payment for the Duration.

   Word of the Day for Thursday March 14, 2002:

   raconteur \rack-on-TUR\, noun:
   One who excels in telling stories and anecdotes.

     An  excellent  raconteur,  he had a varied stock of stories
     and enjoyed the joke just as much when it was on himself as
     he did when it was on some one else.
     --""Rockefeller  Wit  Endeared  Him  to Friends; He Relished
     Quip  by Will Rogers About Him,"" [1]New York Times, May 24,
     1937

     Korda's  tone  of  voice  is  affectionate  and urbane, his
     manner  that of the accomplished raconteur who never spoils
     the story with a heavy-handed moral, relying for his effect
     on the telling anecdote and the apt phrase.
     --Lewis Lapham, ""Adventures in the Book Trade,"" [2]New York
     Times, May 23, 1999

     He  has  an  excellent raconteur's mind, memory, vocabulary
     and  tongue,  brings  in a story just at the right time, in
     the  right  manner,  serves  his anecdotes perfectly either
     piping hot or ice-cold as tragedies.
     --Anatole Pohorilenko and James Crump, When We Were Three
     _________________________________________________________

   Raconteur  is from French, from raconter, ""to relate, to tell,
   to  narrate,""  from  Old French, from re- + aconter, ""to count
   up, to reckon.""

   Word of the Day for Monday April 8, 2002:

   recalcitrant \rih-KAL-sih-truhnt\, adjective:
   Stubbornly resistant to and defiant of authority or restraint.

     If  they  lingered  too long, Clarice hurried them along in
     the  same annoyed way she rushed recalcitrant goats through
     the gate.
     -- Kaye Gibbons, [1]On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon

     As   Mr.   Lincoln  and  his  Union  generals  insisted  on
     unconditional  surrender,  the  end  of  slavery,  and  the
     specter  of an egalitarian nation where race and class were
     in   theory   to  be  subordinate  ideas,  so  recalcitrant
     Southerners  by  the summer of 1864 dug in deeper for their
     Armageddon to come.
     --Victor Davis Hanson, [2]The Soul Of Battle

     This  recalcitrant  fellow  was  the  only  dissenter in an
     otherwise unanimous recommendation.
     --Sherwin  B.  Nuland,  ""Indoctrinology,""  [3]New Republic,
     February 19, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Recalcitrant  derives from Latin recalcitrare, ""to kick back,""
   from  re-,  ""back""  + calcitrare, ""to strike with the heel, to
   kick,"" from calx, calc-, ""the heel.""

   Synonyms:   unruly,   ungovernable,  intractable,  refractory,
   willful,  headstrong,  wayward,  disobedient.  [4]Find more at

   Word of the Day for Tuesday March 19, 2002:

   levity \LEV-uh-tee\, noun:
   1.   Lightness   of   manner   or   speech,   especially  when
   inappropriate or excessive; frivolity.
   2. Lack of steadiness or constancy; changeableness.

     They sat there in their formal bargeman's rig... looking
     solemn:  they were part of a ceremony, and levity, winking,
     whispering, smiling, had no place in it.
     --Patrick O'Brian, [1]The Hundred Days

     I must say that if the doctor was indulging in levity at my
     expense, it is a levity I find in the worst possible taste.
     --Alfred Alcorn, Murder in the Museum of Man
     _________________________________________________________

   Levity is from Latin levitas, from levis, ""light.""

   Word of the Day for Thursday April 4, 2002:

   taciturn \TAS-uh-turn\, adjective:
   Habitually silent; not inclined to talk.

     On stage she seemed to become transformed, and the contrast
     was even more noticeable given her shy, taciturn character,
     shrouded  in  the  impalpable  veil  of  gloom  that always
     surrounded her.
     --Pino Cacucci, Tina Modotti: A Life

     A  balding,  stocky, taciturn man who wore glasses, he gave
     an impression of distance and seriousness.
     --""Diana's  Driver:  Unsettling  Piece in a Puzzle,"" [1]New
     York Times, September 21, 1997

     In  the  company  of  even his close literary and political
     friends he was shy if not taciturn.
     --""Passionate voice of the press,"" [2]Irish Times, November
     4, 1997
     _________________________________________________________

   Taciturn  comes  from  Latin  taciturnus,  from tacere, ""to be
   silent.""

     The  Pen  which  gives. . .  permanence to the evanescent
     thought of a moment.
     --Horace Smith, Tin Trumpet

     Every  tornado  is  a  little  different,  and they are all
     capricious, evanescent and hard to get a fix on.

     Born,"" [1]New York Times, May 11, 1999

     The  accidentally  famous. . . may write books, appear on
     talk  shows,  and, in so doing, attract even greater public
     attention.  This  type  of  celebrity status, of course, is
     brittle and evanescent.
     --Lawrence M. Friedman, The Horizontal Society
     _________________________________________________________

   Word of the Day for Tuesday March 12, 2002:

   desideratum \dih-sid-uh-RAY-tum; -RAH-\, noun;
   plural desiderata:
   Something desired or considered necessary.

     No  one in Berkeley -- at least, no one I consorted with --
     thought  art was for sissies, or that a pensionable job was
     the highest desideratum.
     --John  Banville,  ""Just  a dream some of us had,"" [1]Irish
     Times, August 24, 1998

     Immense  wealth, and its lavish expenditure, fill the great
     house with all that can please the eye, or tempt the taste.
     Here, appetite, not food, is the great desideratum.
     --Frederick Douglass, [2]My Bondage, My Freedom

     A  technical  dictionary ... is one of the desiderata in
     anatomy.
     --Alexander Monro, Essay on Comparative Anatomy
     _________________________________________________________

   Desideratum is from Latin desideratum, ""a thing desired,"" from
   desiderare, ""to desire.""

   Word of the Day for Monday April 1, 2002:

   lachrymose \LAK-ruh-mohs\, adjective:
   1. Given to shedding tears; suffused with tears; tearful.
   2. Causing or tending to cause tears.

     At  the farewell party on the boat, Joyce was surrounded by
     a lachrymose family.
     --Edna  O'Brien,  ""She  Was the Other Ireland,"" [1]New York
     Times, June 19, 1988

     I  promise  to do my best, and if at any time my resolution
     lapses,  pen  me a few fierce vitriolic words and you shall
     receive  by  the next post a lachrymose & abject apology in
     my most emotional hand writing.
     --Rupert Brooke, letter to James Strachey, July 7, 1905

     The  game is perpetuated by the sons in a sometimes vicious
     sibling  rivalry  that  inevitably subsides into lachrymose
     reconciliation.
     --Arthur Gelb and Barbara Gelb, [2]O'Neill: Life With Monte
     Cristo

     Meanwhile,  a  lachrymose  new  waltz,  ""After  The Ball Is
     Over,"" was sweeping the nation.
     --Benjamin   Welles,   [3]Sumner   Welles:   FDR's   Global
     Strategist
     _________________________________________________________

   Lachrymose is from Latin lacrimosus, from lacrima, ""tear.""

   Word of the Day for Tuesday April 2, 2002:

   abscond \ab-SKOND\, intransitive verb:
   To  depart  secretly;  to  steal away and hide oneself -- used
   especially   of  persons  who  withdraw  to  avoid  arrest  or
   prosecution.

     The criminal is not concerned with influencing or affecting
     public  opinion:  he simply wants to abscond with his money
     or  accomplish  his  mercenary  task  in  the  quickest and
     easiest  way  possible  so  that he may reap his reward and
     enjoy the fruits of his labours.
     --Bruce Hoffman, [1]Inside Terrorism

     Pearl,  now  an orphan (her father having absconded shortly
     after  her  conception),  has  been  taken to live with her
     great-aunt Margaret in the north of England.
     --Zoe Heller, [2]Everything You Know
     _________________________________________________________

   Abscond  comes  from Latin abscondere, ""to conceal,"" from ab-,
   abs-, ""away"" + condere, ""to put, to place.""

   Word of the Day for Thursday March 7, 2002:

   malediction \mal-uh-DIK-shun\, noun:
   A curse or execration.

     There  Justice  Minister  Bola  Ige,  confronted  with  the
     general incivility of local police, placed a malediction on
     the  cads.  Said  the  Hon. Bola Ige, ""I pray that God will
     make big holes in their pockets.""
     --""Sic  Semper Tyrannis! Oppressors Face People's Justice,""
     American Spectator, May 1, 2001

     A  conspiracy  of  infamy so black that, when it is finally
     exposed,  its  principals shall be forever deserving of the
     maledictions of all honest men.
     --Joseph  McCarthy,  quoted  in  [1]Venona: Decoding Soviet
     Espionage in America, by Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes
     _________________________________________________________

   Malediction  comes from Latin maledictio, from maledicere, ""to
   speak  ill,  to abuse,"" from Latin male, ""badly"" + dicere, ""to
   speak, to say.""

   Word of the Day for Saturday February 23, 2002:

   sybarite \SIB-uh-ryt\, noun:
   A person devoted to luxury and pleasure.

     This  worldly  cleric, nicknamed ""the sybarite of Saumane"",
     friend  of  Voltaire  and  a  social  luminary in Paris and
     Avignon,   lived  a  high  old  life  within  the  medieval
     fortifications of his chateau in Provence.
     --""The  dubious  charms  of  Citizen Sade,"" [1]Irish Times,
     April 17, 1999

     Beneath   the   prudish   disapproval  that  colored  Upton
     Sinclair's assessment of California's wealthy sybarites was
     an  amused  astonishment  at how hard they worked at having
     fun, at how deadly serious they were about pleasure.
     --Richard  White,  ""What California taught America,"" [2]The
     New Republic, December 1, 1997

     And  when  the  final  blessing  of  a  perfect French cook
     appeared  to  make our domestic picture complete, we became
     utter  sybarites, frank worshippers of the splendors of the
     French cuisine.
     --Samuel Chamberlain, [3]Cl?mentine in the Kitchen
     _________________________________________________________

   Sybarite  is  derived  from  Greek Sybarites, from Sybaris, an
   ancient  Greek  city noted for the luxurious, pleasure-seeking
   habits of many of its inhabitants.

   Word of the Day for Friday March 29, 2002:

   nonagenarian \non-uh-juh-NAIR-ee-uhn; no-nuh-\, noun:
   A  ninety  year  old  person;  someone  whose  age  is  in the
   nineties.

     There  seemed  to  be  relatively  few [1]octogenarians and
     nonagenarians  alive in the early 1930s. Contrast that with
     my  current  practice,  in  which  I  see a great number of
     patients in their eighties and nineties.
     --Stephen  L. Richmond, ""Tales from the Death Certificate,""
     Physician Assistant, January 1999

     Good  health  is  essential, of course--a gift that none of
     these  nonagenarians,  having  outlived  friends  and loved
     ones, takes for granted.
     --Roy  Huffman, ""Working Past 90,"" [2]Fortune, November 13,
     2000
     _________________________________________________________

   Nonagenarian  derives  from Latin nonagenarius, ""containing or
   consisting   of   ninety,""   from  nonageni-,  ""ninety  each"",
   ultimately  from novem, ""nine,"" as in November, originally the
   ninth month of the old Roman calendar.

   Word of the Day for Saturday April 6, 2002:

   demagogue \DEM-uh-gog\, noun:
   1.  A leader who obtains power by means of impassioned appeals
   to the emotions and prejudices of the populace.
   2. A leader of the common people in ancient times.

     This  was  to  have  held a sculpture of a Roman charioteer
     driving  four  horses,  but  the  work was never completed,
     leaving behind what looks like a diving board or a futurist
     balcony,  ideally suited for a demagogue exhorting a throng
     below.
     --Michael  Z.  Wise,  ""A Fascist Utopia Adapted for Today,""
     [1]New York Times, July 11, 1999

     A  consummate  demagogue,  McCarthy  played  upon  cold war
     emotions  and  made  charges  so  fantastic that frightened
     people believed the worst.
     --Arthur  Herman,  Joseph  McCarthy: Reexaming the Life and
     Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator

     Even  when  he  showed  his  true colors as a demagogue and
     trickster,  Stalin  did  so  in  such  a crisp and weighty,
     confidence-inspiring  manner that he bewitched not only his
     conversational partner but himself as well.
     --Milovan  Djilase,  Fall  of  the  New Class: A History of
     Communism's Self-Destruction
     _________________________________________________________

   Demagogue  derives  from  Greek  demagogos,  ""a  leader of the
   people,""  from demos, ""the people"" + agogos, ""leading, one who
   leads,"" from agein, ""to lead.""

   Word of the Day for Wednesday March 13, 2002:

   indomitable \in-DOM-ih-tuh-buhl\, adjective:
   Incapable of being subdued or overcome; unconquerable.

     Now,  late  in his career, when he could no longer pull off
     all of the individual moves that had once set him apart, it
     had become increasingly obvious that what had distinguished
     him  was  his  indomitable  will, his refusal to let either
     opposing  players or the passage of time affect his need to
     win.
     --David  Halberstam,  [1]Playing  for Keeps: Michael Jordan
     and the World He Made

     Because  of  his  strength  and  toughness  as  well as his
     constant attention to the welfare of his army, his soldiers
     affectionately called him Old Hickory. Hickory was as tough
     a  substance  as they knew, and General Andrew Jackson was,
     in their minds, indomitable.
     --Robert V. Remini, [2]The Battle of New Orleans
     _________________________________________________________

   Indomitable  is  from  Latin  indomitabilis, from in-, ""not"" +
   domitare, from domare, ""to tame.""

"Retention & Severance Plan","
To:  All US Domestic Employees
From:  Office of the Chief Executive

Earlier this week, we reached final resolution with the Creditors' Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies, or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy.  Later this morning, we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court.  It will be public and posted on the court's website, but we have posted the plan on <http://home.enron.com>.  (See link below).  Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan.  After that, the court may approve or modify it.  We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April.

We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors' Committee.  To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court, a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.  This plan meets that criterion.

We know all of you are interested in the plan's details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future.  To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work, we should first explain some near-term restructuring goals.

As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders, restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold, as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows.  We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy.  We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity.

This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate non-core assets or wind down the estate, as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business.  Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring, the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization.

The proposed plan is retroactive to March 1, 2002, and has a maximum value up to $130 million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections.  It includes the following components:
Severance benefits valued up to $7 million,
Retention payments valued at $40 million, and
Liquidation incentive pool, which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate, with a minimum value of $7.4 million and a maximum value of up to $90 million, one percent of the estate's cash collection target of $9 billion.

SEVERANCE BENEFITS
A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan.  Under the proposed plan, employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service, with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of $4,500.  If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause, he or she is not eligible for severance benefits.

Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees.  This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  The details of those plans have been shared with employees of non-debtor companies.

RETENTION
Under the proposed plan, retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely, or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring.  Regrettably, not all employees will receive retention.

An eligible employee's retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary.  At the beginning of each quarter, or three-month period, eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors.  The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period.

An employee participating in the retention program will receive 25 percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period, with payouts as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 75 percent of the earned retention for a period is non-vested, deferred, and will be paid to an employee after February 28, 2003.

If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February 28, 2003, an employee will receive all deferred retention, plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated.  Employees' earned and deferred retention payments are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention, with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received.  Depending on an employee's personal circumstances, a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated.

If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention.  He or she would not be eligible for severance.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL
Under the proposed plan, employees identified as critical to the sale of non-core assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool (LIP).  The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate.

Enron's management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each $500 million dollars is collected, also called a ""collection milestone"".  Fifty percent of an employee's earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached.  The remaining 50 percent of the earned liquidation incentive is non-vested and deferred.

If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter, but progress has been made, a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of $1.85 million.  Fifty percent of an employee's quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 50 percent of an earned advance will be non-vested and deferred, and will offset against future incentive payments.

All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events:
1.		Enron's reorganization is complete; or
2.	the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause, or
3.	upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections.

Employees' earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits.  If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

OTHER ITEMS
Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the 90-day period prior to its bankruptcy's filing.  To that end, creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate.  The Creditors' Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company, and stays with the company through August 31, 2002, or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause, whichever comes first.

All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits, deferred quarterly retention payments, or deferred liquidation payments.

We know how long you have waited for details about this plan.  We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week.  Although the Creditors' Committee has approved it, this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court.  Therefore, it is possible an employee's status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court.  Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan.

   Word of the Day for Thursday March 28, 2002:

   doula \DOO-luh\, noun:
   A  woman  who  assists  during  childbirth  labor and provides
   support  to  the  mother,  her  child  and  the  family  after
   childbirth.

     Chris   Morley   launched  Tender  Care  Doula  Service  in
     Valencia, California, seven years ago to provide nonmedical
     postpartum care workers (or doulas) to frazzled new moms.
     --Roy Huffman, ""Healthy returns,"" [1]Entrepreneur Magazine,
     February 1, 1996

     Unlike  midwives,  who  deliver  babies and are licensed to
     perform  medical  tasks, labor doulas provide emotional and
     physical support to the laboring parents.
     --Stephen  L. Richmond, ""One Labor-Intensive Job,"" [2]Time,
     March 12, 2001
     _________________________________________________________

   Doula  derives  from Greek doula, ""servant-woman, slave,"" akin
   to [3]hierodule.

ENRON POSTS JOBS
The company is reinstituting a job posting process to help fill open positions.  In the midst of restructuring, the number of job openings is understandably limited.   However, postings will be updated regularly.  Within the job posting system called jobOps, an employee can apply for a position by using their current employee profile as their resume or modify it to create an updated resume.  Employee's can still update their profile information in eHRonline.  At this time, only current employees will be able to apply for a position from within jobOps.  You may access current postings by visiting https://hrglobal.enron.com/JobOps.  The system can also be reached by clicking on the jobOps link from http://Home.enron.com or http:hrweb.enron.com.  

COMPANY RESUMES SERVICE AWARDS
Enron has resumed its Service Awards Program to recognize employees' years of service to the organization.  Employees in both debtor and non-debtor companies are eligible to receive service awards upon their employment anniversary every five years.  Employees who are nearing an employment anniversary or passed an anniversary while the program was suspended will soon receive by mail a brochure and order form that allows them to select their individual gift.  The selection of gifts has recently been updated yet still includes favorites such as pen and pencil sets, knives, jewelry or grandfather clocks depending on an employee's years of service to the company.  Service award notification, gift catalogues, and order forms will be available to eligible employees online in the near future.

   Word of the Day for Tuesday April 9, 2002:

   quondam \KWAHN-duhm; KWAHN-dam\, adjective:
   Having been formerly; former; sometime.

     A  quondam flower child, she spent seven years at the Royal
     College  of  Art,  before  becoming a lecturer at Edinburgh
     School of Art.
     --""Interview:   Cool,   calm   collector,""  [1]Independent,
     December 13, 1997

     For  the  unregenerate  ""peasant""... had gone there with
     the   successful   glass   distributor,   shrewd  investor,
     versatile talker, and quondam [2]bon vivant whose motto was
     ""The best is good enough for me.""
     --Ted Solotaroff, [3]Truth Comes in Blows: A Memoir

     There  was  an  exception  to  this in the form of Mrs Edna
     Parsons,  a  formidable  Englishwoman who had once been the
     Prince's  nanny  and now served as proctor, supervising his

   loquacious \loh-KWAY-shuhs\, adjective:
   1. Very talkative.
   2. Full of excessive talk; wordy.

     The  meeting  went  on  for hours, accommodating loquacious
     bores who were each allowed their say.
     --Andrew  Sullivan,  ""Gay  Life,  Gay  Death,""  [1]The  New
     Republic, December 17, 1990

     In  drawing  a sharp contrast with the loquacious Ginsburg,
     her  new  lawyers  appeared for just a few moments and said
     virtually  nothing  to reporters before retreating into the
     building.
     --Peter  Baker, ""Lewinsky Replaces Ginsburg,"" [2]Washington
     Post, June 3, 1998
     _________________________________________________________

   Loquacious  comes  from Latin loquax, ""talkative,"" from loqui,
   ""to speak.""

Next week, the long awaited Retention/Severance Program will be rolled out to employees.  The latest information I have heard is the plan will be filed with the court on Monday, but the Office of the Chairman will be sending out an e-mail and perhaps a voicemail to let us know.  Julie and I will be meeting with each of you to explain the plan as it pertains to you.  I anticipate these meetings will begin on Tuesday.  In advance, we appreciate your patience in the process.  There is a lot to cover, and it will take us some time to do so.  It's exciting to finally have the long awaited plan!

On another note, please use your discretion, and if you do not have a critical project with a tight deadline bearing down on you, please take the afternoon off to enjoy your family or start your trip or whatever your plans might be.  All I ask, please be professional and don't leave earlier than noon, and don't leave a deadline in a lurch.  

Please enjoy the Easter week-end, forget Enron, and come back next week to learn about your opportunities with Enron.  It will be great to have some certainty back into our lives so we can make our personal decisions.

  <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>	The Crown Room Club offers a useful oasis when you travel, with data ports and computer access (at select locations), free local telephone calls, fax machines, desk space, fully staffed bars, comfortable chairs and more.

The regular membership rate is $475 annually, or $725 for you and a spouse.

In order to receive $20 off the rates listed above, be sure to join by April 15. To enroll, visit any Delta Crown Room Club or print an application from delta.com/crcapplication <http://e-mailprograms.delta.com/AC/Clickthru?q=ad-_4jAQzEESOiE-Nnih6DfwYmgkVIE>.   <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>

  <http://www.delta.com/images/emailprograms/spacer.gif>	Offer is not retroactive and may not be combined with any other offer, discount or award. A Crown Room Club membership obtained by the redemption of frequent flyer miles is not eligible for this one-time bonus-mileage offer and the $20 discount. If membership purchased includes a spouse card, only one SkyMiles bonus and $20 discount will apply. When mailing a check as payment for your Crown Room Club membership, be sure to deduct $20 from the membership fee for your applicable SkyMiles membership level. Allow six to eight weeks for the bonus miles to appear in your account. Mailed applications must be postmarked by April 15, 2002. Faxed applications must be received by April 15, 2002. All standard Delta SkyMiles program rules and conditions apply. Offer is nontransferable.
