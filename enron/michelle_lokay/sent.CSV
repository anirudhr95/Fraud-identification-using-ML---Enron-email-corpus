I have a family friend who is trying to fill an accounting/office
administration position.  It is a family who has oil and gas interests,
partnership interests and other family investments.  They use KPMG as their
accountants but they need someone in house to input data and prepare monthly
reports for them and to give to the accounting firm.  Salary range is around
$40,000 and includes health insurance and parking.  They are located
downtown.

If you know anyone interested and qualified, have them email me.

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 
Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market


Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila


Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.

"Joke: Computer or Husband?","Happy Holidays!  

 

 

Dear Tech Support,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0
uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed
undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes
the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to
no avail. What can I do?

Desperate

> >---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Desperate,

First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,
while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the
command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.

Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and
Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to
Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad
program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.

DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend
program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a
limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend
Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.

Good luck.

Subject:	Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 

Here is how I see the February release, with the 50/50 sharing mechanism:

ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.1020 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $71,400 [$0.1020 x 25,000 x 28 days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will be adjusted for a capacity release credit of $56,700  [($0.1020 - $0.021) x 25,000 x 28 days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $14,700 [$0.021 x 25,000 x 28 days]
ENA will be looking for a payment of $14,700 for their portion of the shared upside


I'd copied your format for January...what do you think of the February numbers?

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	ETS Office of the Chairman  
Sent:	Monday, March 11, 2002 2:09 PM
To:	DL-GA-all_ets
Subject:	Severance Summary Plan Description - Domestic Pipeline Assets

We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. 

At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of ""safety net"" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.

The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under ""ETS HR Manuals"". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . 

I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

Stan

Mojave/Topock
I have two months with different measured volumes than you have. Please fax
the Daily Volume Statement for Meter ID: 0009214-01, Meter Name: TW/Mojave
Topok I/C (DEL), DRN: 000068288 for October 2000 and July 1999.  My fax
number is 719-520-4810.

CIG/Tumbleweed
I have looked back through October 1995. 
Measured Volume Difference. 
Jul-01  CIG = 65 dth TW = 0
Mar-00  CIG = 25 dth TW = 0
CIG is the custody transfer meter. Do you need meter statements to correct
your records?

Scheduled Volume Difference
Jul-00  CIG = 839,636   TW = 839,638 Difference = (2)
Apr-00  CIG = 163,162   TW= 163,134 Difference = 28 
Oct-98  CIG = 84,505   TW = 85,107 Difference = 602
Aug-98  CIG = 326,831   TW = 326,397 Difference = 434
Jul-98  CIG = 212,226   TW = 202,228 Difference = 9,998
May-97  CIG = 86,770   TW = 99,972 Difference = (13,202)
Apr-96  CIG = 5,447   TW = 5,522 Difference = (75)
Jan-96  CIG = 59,790   TW = 62,000 Difference = (2,210)

Could you re-check your scheduled volumes?

Michelle:  

ok we are all set up.  We are going to do a snow shoe trip on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. for 2 hours.  Supposedly easy trail, just enough to work up a sweat.  Then we are going to drive (45 minute scenic drive) to Hot Springs, Co.  Probably have time for a lunch.  Our messages are set up for 3:00 p.m. and we get to soak in any one of 21 sulphur pools at our leisure.  Sounds divine doesn't it?

Since they have to put salt on the pavement the guy suggested that we bring our own flip flops.  He says we can rent towels and robes but if I remember I'll bring them for us as backups if they don't have any available.

So looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops.  Oh yeah, do you have a warm pair of boots.  We can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots.  If you don't think you have a pair let me know and I can bring an extra pair along.  Hopefully they won't be too big for your tiny feet.  But boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks!

Let me know,

Terri Dickerson

Dear Tech Support,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0
uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed
undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes
the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to
no avail. What can I do?

Desperate

> >---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Desperate,

First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,
while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the
command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.

Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and
Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to
Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad
program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.

DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend
program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a
limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend
Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.

Good luck.

You have two cows.  You borrow 80% of the forward value of the two cows from your bank, then buy another cow with 5% down and the rest financed by the seller on a note callable if your market cap goes below $20B at a rate 2 times prime. You now sell three cows to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at a 2nd bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more and this transaction process is upheld by your independent auditor and no Balance Sheet provided with the press release that announces that Enron as a major owner of cows will begin trading cows via the Internet site COW (cows on web). I am sure you now fully understand what happened.

Susan,

Per our conversation today, Transwestern Pipeline and PG&E Trading can wait until after the upcoming holidays to discuss PG&E's right of first refusal on the 61,000 MMBtu per day that is currently posted. In fact, Section 13 (H) of Transwestern's FTS-1 rate schedule indicates that Transwestern could wait until July 31, 2002 to notify PG&E Trading as to the terms of the best offer. PG&E Trading would then have two weeks to notify Transwestern of its desire to match. I, however, suggest that we begin discussions of the outcome of the posting sometime in January.

I hope that your Holiday Season is everything you are hoping it will be. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Best Regards,

A primer on how to succeed in business:

Capitalism

You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.  Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.


Enron Capitalism

You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed
company, using letters of credit  opened by your brother-in-law at
the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated  general
offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for
five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by your CFO
who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on
six more.

Subject: NWP System Notice - System Operations


Post Date: March 15, 2002
Category: CRITICAL NOTES
Subcategory: MISCELLANEOUS
Subject: System Operations

Notice Text:
All Shippers Letter #02-033
Date:	3/15/02
Time:	11:00 a.m. MST

Subject: System Operations

The purpose of this letter is to inform Northwest's shippers of how it
intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by Questar Pipeline
at Clay Basin and by Transwestern Pipeline at its La Plata facilities.

Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from
April 2, 2002 through April 15, 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests
on April 16 and 17, 2002.  During this time Northwest will have no access to
Clay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La
Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5,
2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.

During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compressor
have exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in,
Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwest
will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result
cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.

If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the
Questar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following
steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line
pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut
north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata
to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling
through Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries
from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate
confirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate;
and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.

If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do
not exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility
during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers can
help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule by
securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson
Prairie storage during this work.

Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of
the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the
situation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system
restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest is
confident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the
Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.

If you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Services
representative.

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

"Brief of Amsterdam Weather Conference","Weather Trading 
Energy and weather are so inextricably tied to one another that it is sometimes hard to separate the two. The demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter. If, therefore, you have an unusually cool summer, the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated, and the same in case of an unusually warm winter. Several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand, and would face serious financial losses in such cases. 
Weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations. It is no surprise, then, that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by Tom Fletcher, head of weather trading for Mirant <http://www.mirant.com/>. 
In describing weather trading, Fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 1997. Fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product. He went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how Mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor. 
With presentations from other market leaders such as Centrica, I-Wex, Spectron, Aquila, LIFFE, Mirant, Bewag, Aon and Entergy-Koch, Weather Trading Europe <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/> provided three days of the latest developments in European trading. 
The conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market-where is it and how to access it; data issues-the state of play in European weather data and how you can best utilize the information you've got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills. 
As weather trading takes its place in the online world, there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives from corporations to avoid the market becoming a predominantly speculative industry.

Michelle:  

ok we are all set up.  We are going to do a snow shoe trip on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. for 2 hours.  Supposedly easy trail, just enough to work up a sweat.  Then we are going to drive (45 minute scenic drive) to Hot Springs, Co.  Probably have time for a lunch.  Our messages are set up for 3:00 p.m. and we get to soak in any one of 21 sulphur pools at our leisure.  Sounds divine doesn't it?

Since they have to put salt on the pavement the guy suggested that we bring our own flip flops.  He says we can rent towels and robes but if I remember I'll bring them for us as backups if they don't have any available.

So looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops.  Oh yeah, do you have a warm pair of boots.  We can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots.  If you don't think you have a pair let me know and I can bring an extra pair along.  Hopefully they won't be too big for your tiny feet.  But boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks!

Let me know,

We still need to bill Conoco the TCR II Surcharges on 20,000 MMBtu per day.  Maybe Michelle can get with Conoco and see how they want it billed.  If they want it billed on their new contract, maybe we can do an amendment.  If they want it billed on the old contracts, then you need to contact someone in the contract group to see how we bill it since the contracts are expired (i.e., overriding the CBS system or something).

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).

I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Thanks!

Jeff

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 
Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign 20,000 
mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the period beginning 
June 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002.  During the four month period beginning 
October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 2003, the primary receipts will be 
reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.  Beginning March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary 
receipts will be increased to 20,000 mmbtu.  

For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 
2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options prior to 
electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.
