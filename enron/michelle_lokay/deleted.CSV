"TW CAS Hands -on Training","Michelle,

A few months ago, TW Marketing and Fac. Planning had a meeting to discuss TW CAS system issues. At this meeting, you indicated that the TW Marketers would like to have some training on CAS. I have discussed with Perry Frazier & he would like to set up 30 minute one on one hands-on training sessions with each individual. 

Can you coordinate with your team & identify a list of TW Marketer's who would like to have CAS training? I will work with Perry to schedule the training times.

Thanks Ramona

Subject:	February -1 Capacity Analysis System ( CAS) meeting
Importance:	High


There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

Have a Safe & Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !!

 

THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS 

By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced 
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out 
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the 
holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine 
without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate 
second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, 
they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your 
favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think 
so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. 
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you 
follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to 
New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. 

1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on 
   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In 
   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where 
   they're serving rum balls. 

2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine 
   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than 
   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. 
   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's 
   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. 
   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than 
   you think. It's Christmas! 

3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of 
   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill 
   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. 

4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk 
   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a 
   sports car with an automatic transmission. 

5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control 
   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? 

6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. 
   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the 
   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
   eggnog. 

7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like 
   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position 
   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before 
   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of 
   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them 
   again. 

8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. 
   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one 
   dessert? Labor Day? 

9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the 
   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, 
   have some standards, mate. 

10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the 
    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. 
    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just 
    around the corner.

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","


The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 14
Beginning today through 3/19, the Corporate Security team will replace the GRC.dat file in W:\scripts\UpdateGRC and W:\scripts\logon\Win2000\original to point NAV clients on nahou-apnav01 to nahou-apnav02 (only about 650 left).  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
From 11:00 - 11:15 a.m., the Corporate Security group will remove the svceu_SAPConnect account from CORP Domain Admins group.  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m.., the Unix Team will upgrade the Time server.  Timex.ect.enron.com which is now on a Unix desktop network will be moved to a production network and to Netra T1 hardware. It would be doing the same activity as Rolex which was replaced on Monday. All clients are now pointing to new Rolex server & Timex.  No impact is expected.  

Mar. 15
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will replace the switch on the Extranet link HOPIX1.  This change will cause intermittent outages for those external companies using this link to access the Enron Network.

Mar. 15
From 8:00 p.m. through 3/17 at 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 15
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Corporate Server team will place Nahou-appr1 into the Corp Domain.  This change will affect applications using the R drive. 
Mar. 16
From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Telephony Services will perform the monthly maintenance on the CMS (Call management) systems.  This maintenance affects only call center reporting.  No impact to users is expected.
Mar. 16
From 2:00 - 4:00 p.m., the Blackberry Network Team will perform maintenance on a component of the Blackberry Network.  Some customers may experience delays in receiving messages.  It is also possible that messages sent from he Blackberry may be returned.  Returned messages can be resent after the maintenance is complete.
Mar. 18
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will change the DHCP scopes to update the secondary WINS and DNS entries.  This change will affect workstations that get their IP addresses via DHCP.  All scopes are renewed on a 24-hour basis so all changes should be completed by 3/19.  No impact is expected.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 
Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.  All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates.

"ETS and Corporate Change Control, addition","
A new change control has been added...

Mar. 22
From 5:00 - 7:00 p.m., the EDI team will migrate the ECNET server from the 172.28.176.249 network.  This migration will cause a total outage for the ECNET server.  Applications accessing this device via IP address will need to be changed to reflect the new IP which is 172.16.2.22.  The EDINET server at 172.28.176.21 will also be migrated the week of Apr. 6.  More information regarding that change will be available next week.

"Procedures for Transwestern Gas Control/Marketing Morning Meetings","The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 25, 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.

"ETS and  Corporate Change Control","
The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.  Each block of numbers will experience an outage of a few minutes during which calls made to an affected number will not go through and will not roll to voice mail.  The numbers affected are: 345-5000...6999; 713-646-6000...6599; 713-646-7000...7999; 713-646-8200...8399; 713-646-8600..8699; 713-646-9700...9799; 713-345-0200...2999.  The number 713-345-7000 to access voice mail will not be affected by this maintenance.  However, any number within these maintenance groups will be affected regardless of whether it was moved from 3AC.  This change will impact ETS users.

"Energy Derivatives/Electric Power Seminars","Quick question:

I was wondering if you know anyone who could benefit
from a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk 
 management policy, gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or 
 electric power trading.  
 
 If you do, please make them aware of  PGS Energy Training's
upcoming seminars in downtown Houston (in February) and
downtown Philadelphia (March). 
 http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
Available seminars include:
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)
    6) How to Value Electric Generation Assets as Real Options 
    7) Fundamentals of Value-at-Risk (Soli Forouzan)
 
For seminar dates and hotel information, call 412-279-9298 
or visit  http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
 You can also save money by bringing a group of 4 or more. 
 With a group rate, your cost for $1,295 seminars is reduced 
 to $895 per attendee-- a savings of $1,600 from regular 
 prices. The group price for the $695 programs is $495.
 
As you know, successful people invest the they time need to
improve their career prospects and increase their value to
their organization.  Hope to see you there!

"FW: A&M Football Scare","


Texas A&M football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown powdery substance on the
practice field. Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while
the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the
FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually
the goal line.  Practice resumed when the FBI agents decided that the team
was not likely to encounter the substance again.


Ha! Ha!

"RE: Western Gas Sales Confirmation","Michelle,

In reviewing the latest gas sale to WGR effective April 1, I found that the referenced downstream contract (CR 27608) that WGR would be using is not valid for April activity.  Dennis Lee confirmed that the contract is considered a Red Rock expansion request that may start in June.  Do you want me to contact WGR and have them change the contract that we hand-off to?  WGR has  contract 24042 set up for another gas sale effective April 1.  Let me know how you would like me to proceed.

Thanks,  Bert

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","
The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 21
From 5:00 - 7:30 p.m., the Corporate Unix team will perform maintenance on dns1-corp.  Dns1-corp is the primary dns server for enron.com domain.  Queries to enron.com domain will be forwarded to dns2-corp which is the secondary dns server.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the Messaging team will update the virus engine on Mailsweeper servers. This will be done on a monthly basis for better protection against new viruses.  No impact is expected.
Mar. 21
From 8:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 23
From 5:00 p.m. through 3/24 at 7:00 a.m., the Envision system will be taken offline to perform backups.  Users will not be able to access information located on Envision during this maintenance.
Mar. 25
From 9:00 a.m. through 4/5 at 3:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will make WINS/DNS changes on all servers to reflect the new server settings.  Devices that require a reboot will be submitted via a separate change control.   Some impact may occur during these changes and that information will be forwarded as it becomes available.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.  
Future Changes:
ENS backbone will be upgrading the code on the floor switches in the very near future.  Individual companies will be contacted as the floors are scheduled.  This will result in network outages for ETS and will be coordinated with ENS.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.

Feb 27
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will block all ICMP messages from all Internet routers.  These changes will be made on the Houston, Ardmore EIN, and Omaha Internet routers.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 27
From 9:00 - 10:00 p.m., the Messaging team will upgrade Nahou-MSBES01P, Nahou-MSBES02P and Nahou-MSBES03P to SP2 and apply a hotfix.  This change will result in a five minute delay sending and receiving Blackberry messages.

Feb 28
From 7:00 p.m. through 3/1 at 1:00 a.m., the Unix team will upgrade the ftp.enron.com server from existing Ultar2 to E450 as well as upgrade ftp to Proftp ver. 1.2. This maintenance will result in a total outage of the ftp.enron.com site.  The old sites moby.enron.com and sparky.enron.com will no longer exist after this change.  Support staff should ensure jobs going to the enron ftp server use ftp.enron.com.  Any questions about this maintenance, contact me at 713-853-3381 or 713-859-6676.

Mar. 6
At 12:00 p.m., the Gas Measurement team will decommission the MIPS server (IP address 192.168.175.62).  All users and processing should be pointing to PGAS as the MIPS system is not longer being updated. The MIPS server will be powered off at this time but the equipment will not be moved until later.

"Dinner to be rescheduled","
All,

When I set the date for the dinner at our house, I forgot that it was around ""Spring Break"".  So, not wanting to cause any conflict in schedule and wanting to help promote family time, I decided to CANCEL the dinner for March 16 and RESCHEDULE for another time.  Sarah and I look forward to having everyone over so we'll put our heads together and come up with a better date.

Hope this hasn't caused any inconvenience,

Mark

"TW Cashouts","CIG
The terminated CIG OBA had language to cashout at the NGPL MidCon price in
the month after the OBA was terminated (10/31/01).
The 11/2001 index price was $2.173/dth * 1,443 dth = $3,135.64 due CIG
through October 31,2001.

Mojave
The old Mojave OBA does not have cashout language related to the 11/30/2001
termination date, therefore the current month pricing would be used for
cashout.
The March Bloomberg Natural Gas El Paso, Topock, AZ (Mojave) index price is
$2.30/dth * 162,111 dth = $372,855.30 due Transwestern through November 30,
2001.

Please let me know if you agree and I will prepare cashout documents.

This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the ""View Printable Page,"" that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

I added an extra ""Printable Page"" button on the page so that the entire page can be printed out.
Michelle, please let me know if you still have problems to get to the TW Unsubscribed Capacity page. Sorry about the delay.

Importance:	High

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

Please go to http://twdev.ets.enron.com our testing site to view the modified TW Unsubscribed Capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want. I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Thanks!

Michelle, 
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is
an informal agenda listing of topics:

1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  

2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks,

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.

ARTICLE:
Will the U.S. regulate CO2 from power plants, giving a massive lift to the
fledgling market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions?

The U.S. Congress continues to discuss regulation of CO2 from power plants
as part of a comprehensive package to address power plant air pollution.
Hearings were convened late last year by the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee to discuss the merits of a four-pollutant power plant
strategy-controlling SO2, NOx, mercury, and CO2 emissions in a coordinated
fashion.

The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks,

"RE: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington","Richard,

What process needs to be followed in order to request a payment to be made to ENA per the terms of the agreement negotiated with Marketing when capacity is released on their behalf?  Please let everyone in the distribution know so they can follow these same procedures for next month as well.

Additionally, do we code the marketing fee revenues to a different account from the transportation revenues and how?


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 
Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Subject:	Rates Changes


Keep in mind that when you do amendments to move primary points around, the rate must be changed in CBS for the corresponding new paths.  Otherwise, CBS reflects  max rates.

It would also be helpful when a new contract is executed that the rate be put in CBS; otherwise, again CBS reflects max rates.

It is important to get these rates in CBS as the forecasting model pulls all rate information from CBS.  If CBS reflects max rates the revenues will be grossly over estimated.

Thanks for your help!

Subject:	Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 

Here is how I see the February release, with the 50/50 sharing mechanism:

ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.1020 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $71,400 [$0.1020 x 25,000 x 28 days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will be adjusted for a capacity release credit of $56,700  [($0.1020 - $0.021) x 25,000 x 28 days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $14,700 [$0.021 x 25,000 x 28 days]
ENA will be looking for a payment of $14,700 for their portion of the shared upside


I'd copied your format for January...what do you think of the February numbers?

This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

MS reps
Call your shippers ASAP and provide an explanation as to why they are paying late.  There seems to be a few shippers who always pay late - North Star Steele, CMS, KN.  If you feel that we need a marketer to get involved with your late payers, please contact them.

I have a family friend who is trying to fill an accounting/office
administration position.  It is a family who has oil and gas interests,
partnership interests and other family investments.  They use KPMG as their
accountants but they need someone in house to input data and prepare monthly
reports for them and to give to the accounting firm.  Salary range is around
$40,000 and includes health insurance and parking.  They are located
downtown.

If you know anyone interested and qualified, have them email me.

3,000/day is being schedule at Wolf Creek and we are not receiving volume thus increasing Continental's imbalance.

Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled?

* Emissions Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Emissions trading options are ripe for the picking - so how can you make
sure you're ready to profit from GHG?  Let's face it - you can't really
afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the
international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per
annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how
you can best seize this exciting nwe market opportunity.  As ever, the
conference will be driven by the industry leaders in this arena, backed up
by expert advice from those helping the indsutry make the right moves in
emissions.

* Weather Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Today's business is all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather
derivatives has become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging at
utilities, airlines, and agriculture have at hand to off-set risks
associated with temperature and precipitation.  With over 70% of Europe's
companies facing weather-related risk, knowing about the latest advances in
weather trading is a necessity.

Eyeforenergy's latest event will be run in conjunction with our European
online trading conference, Energy Trading in the New Economy, and
Eyeforenergy's Emissions Trading 2002 event, so you can learn about the
latest developments in energy and emissions trading all under one roof.

Click here for further information:
http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/


* The Business of Fuel Cells for Transportation
  Dearborn Hotel, Detroit, Michigan
  April 30 - May 1, 2002

As manufacturers are increasingly developing technologies with the energy
industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.

"FW: BR/TW Window Rock Meeting Scheduled for Dec 3rd","Here is the agenda.

Topic #2 in the list is what we will need prior to the meeting.  This had been discussed the last time we were in their office.  Let's discuss these pressure scenarios, etc. before we meet them.

Subject: BR/TW Window Rock Meeting Scheduled for Dec 3rd


Michelle, 
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is
an informal agenda listing of topics:

1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  

2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks, 

Greg Hills

"FW: A&M Football Scare","
Texas A&M football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown powdery substance on the
practice field. Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while
the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the
FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually
the goal line.  Practice resumed when the FBI agents decided that the team
was not likely to encounter the substance again.

Stan................just a reminder to follow up with the commercial group regarding the question about gas going off the system.  While we have capacity, the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers.  There was also the issue of better communication between the commercial group and the field.  They specifically mentioned a situation with ONEOK.  The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them, not our commercial group.

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign

four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28,
2003, the primary receipts will be reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.  Beginning
March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary receipts will be increased
to 20,000 mmbtu.  

For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February
28, 2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options
prior to electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.

Today's News	
 Allegheny Energy Supply Company, Salt River  Project and Sempra Energy Resources Announce Open Season for Proposed  Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation System   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]    PHOENIX, Jan. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- The Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation System (Desert Crossing) is holding an Open Season for customers interested in capacity, beginning today and extending through Feb. 8, 2002.     Open Season is a process in which customers interested in acquiring natural gas storage capacity in a storage facility, and/or transmission capacity on a pipeline, submit bids setting out the terms under which they will agree to purchase the capacity.     Upon completion of the project, the Desert Crossing system will include a 10 billion cubic foot, high-deliverability natural gas storage complex and associated pipeline, located in the Hualapai Valley, north of Kingman, Arizona.  The associated pipeline, spanning roughly 300 miles from outside of Las Vegas to Southwestern Arizona, is projected to be an 800 million cubic feet per day system that will connect the storage complex with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in Arizona and southern Nevada (see map of proposed system at http://www.desert-crossing.com ).     Project sponsors Allegheny Energy Supply Company, the generation and trading subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE ); Salt River Project (SRP); and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE ), said that Desert Crossing will provide a consumer-driven, market-responsive storage and pipeline system to serve the growing needs of the southwestern United States for power and peak period gas supplies. Limitations on natural gas transportation and storage in Arizona and southern Nevada, along with past and projected increases in gas demand by consumers in the region, have resulted in market conditions that make this storage and pipeline project attractive.     ""As proposed, this project with its north-south pipeline configuration will be uniquely situated to increase shippers' and consumers' options for sourcing natural gas and to provide new transportation capacity to the Arizona and southern Nevada markets,"" commented Michael Morrell, president, Allegheny Energy Supply Company. ""The increased storage and transportation capacity will enhance energy reliability at cost-effective prices, which is good news for consumers and shippers of natural gas.""      SRP's associate general manager of power, construction & engineering, David Areghini, concurred.  ""As we continue to diversify our fuel sources by adding new gas-fired power plants, it is important that we increase our ability to obtain the necessary amount of natural gas supplies.  The Desert Crossing project will help ensure an economical and clean energy source for consumers and others in the Southwest for many years.""     ""The additional natural gas supplies will help balance the region's escalating energy demands, especially those of electric generators, as well as provide the potential to help reduce future price spikes in the Southwest,"" said Dwain Boettcher, vice president of planning and analysis for Sempra Energy Resources. ""The hourly scheduling flexibility built into the proposed tariff was designed to transform the way storage service is offered in the future.""     Customers participating in the Open Season and awarded capacity will have unprecedented flexibility with respect to gaining access to the markets and diverse gas supplies in the Southwest.  These customers will be able to optimize their portfolios, because Desert Crossing will be situated at the Southwest's energy crossroads.     The project is subject to obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals and sufficient commitments from third parties during the Open Season. Project scope and costs will be announced at the conclusion of the Open Season. To participate in the Open Season and for more information about Desert Crossing, visit http://www.desert-crossing.com .

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

"Travel Services","
While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.  

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.    

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.  
If you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned, or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies, please
call me 713 328-5139, or email lhinson@allianceworldwide.com

"Red Lake Storage project","You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market


Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila


Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.

THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS 

By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced 
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out 
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the 
holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine 
without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate 
second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, 
they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your 
favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think 
so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. 
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you 
follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to 
New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. 

1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on 
   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In 
   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where 
   they're serving rum balls. 

2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine 
   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than 
   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. 
   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's 
   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. 
   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than 
   you think. It's Christmas! 

3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of 
   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill 
   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. 

4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk 
   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a 
   sports car with an automatic transmission. 

5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control 
   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? 

6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. 
   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the 
   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
   eggnog. 

7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like 
   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position 
   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before 
   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of 
   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them 
   again. 

8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. 
   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one 
   dessert? Labor Day? 

9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the 
   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, 
   have some standards, mate. 

10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the 
    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. 
    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just 
    around the corner.

Hi Michelle - here are the months that there are scheduling discrepencies
from January 1998 forward and the scheduled volume that I have. I can fax
you the daily volume for each of these months so we can narrow down the
research.

01/00  Mojave 842,128 TW 842,127   Difference = 1
03/00  Mojave 912,977 TW 912,917   Difference = 60
06/00  Mojave 606,535 TW 606,534   Difference = 1
09/00  Mojave 1,674,721 TW 1,662,566  Difference = 12,155
11/00  Mojave 857,540 TW 854,874   Difference = 2,666

12/01  Mojave 616,730 TW 616,524   Difference = 206

Sent:	Wednesday, November 21, 2001 10:17 AM
To:	All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON
Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 11	
From 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m., the Envision team will perform hardware maintenance on the Envision system.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16

From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the ""View Printable Page,"" that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

I added an extra ""Printable Page"" button on the page so that the entire page can be printed out. 
Michelle, please let me know if you still have problems to get to the TW Unsubscribed Capacity page. Sorry about the delay.

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

Please go to <http://twdev.ets.enron.com> our testing site to view the modified TW Unsubscribed Capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want. I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Thanks!

"Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading in Europe"," <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/>	 Three trading conferences under one roof...
at the Hotel Okura, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2001	 
 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/>

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Aquila, Systeia Capital Management, Mirant, LIFFE, Element Re, Entergy-Koch Trading, Risk Management Solutions, Centrica, Utilicorp, weatherXchange, Aon Capital Markets and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c459583>...

UBS Warburg estimates that profits
from European power trading alone
will top $2.4 billion in 2002

Add natural gas and oil and you're looking at a huge pot of pure profit, only available to those companies that know how to best take advantage of the rise of deregulation and online trading in the European market. 

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it - you really can't afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.

Subject: Next Wednesday's Meeting Agenda



Michelle, 

Sorry for the delay in getting this to you.  The following is a partial list of items that Williams would like to discuss in our meeting on Wednesday November 14th at 9:30 a.m.  Other questions will probably surface as we move through our discussion.

I would like to start with an overview of the OBA and why the change.  And as we go through the new OBA these questions can be addressed as we get to the appropriate section.  Does that work for you?  

1.  Methodology of clearing the ending imbalance as of November 30th. How does WFS  pay back the ""old"" imbalance while also delivering volumes on the ""new"" OBA?

2.  How will payback be scheduled when your line runs full all of the time? 

3.  We currently net all of the points in the San Juan area.  Will this still be the case? 

4.  How do we handle situations that have occurred multiple times this week where TRW has lost compression.  If this occurs after Intraday 2, how do we makeup during the rest of the month if you cannot accept payback?

5.  When an under delivery occurs, who determines the responsible party and how will the associated volume be excluded from penalty when caused by Transwestern?

6.  What happens when Transwestern accepts Intraday 2 nom increases but cannot accept the physical flow needed to rate out the day?

7.  How do you propose we track separate volumes / imbalances depending on who caused the shortfall? 

Please call if my questions need clarification. 

Thanks

This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the ""View Printable Page,"" that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Richard,

What process needs to be followed in order to request a payment to be made to ENA per the terms of the agreement negotiated with Marketing when capacity is released on their behalf?  Please let everyone in the distribution know so they can follow these same procedures for next month as well.

Additionally, do we code the marketing fee revenues to a different account from the transportation revenues and how?


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 
Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.  All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates.  

I have also been advised by Marketing that another posting may occur for January 2001 (partial month) but nothing has been finalized.  I will send an updated file if necessary.
  
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
