"NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

Gil,

Initial Mirant offer was at 199 BP over 5 year UST.  They are coming in at
high 180BPS.  Also, surety is only for $50MM and we may have need somewhat
in excess of that.  We have asked bond counsel if the opinion as to tax
exemption of the bonds would be intact if we substituted a (i) the second
place bidder or (ii) a prior bidder that failed to clear the tax exempt
hurdle rate but that now was offering to adjust their bid to that level.
Accordingly, TEAC has asked that we canvass current thinking of Enron and El
Paso.  The supplier selection is once again competitive. Therefore, the
higher your discount factor, acceptance of the basic form of the documents
as presented, and ability to perform on a timely basis, then the greater the
likelihood that you may be selected to complete the transaction.

*	Below is a spreadsheet that shows current volumes.  Market prices
are current (10/22) for NYMEX but must be adjusted to Tennessee 500 Zone 1.

*	 Also attached is the Gas Purchase Agreement.  It has been amended
to provide for cures in the event of a termination event, and that should
make the GPA more appealing to surety bond providers. Another draft is due
out shortly.  We would expect to agree in substance within a week, and enter
into the GPA by just after Thanksgiving.

*	Please disregard the Surety Bond form attached to the GPA and refer
to the separate surety bond form attachment below. This basic form has been
approved by at least one surety provider.

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss where your
current pricing would be and the time that you might be expect to perform
within.  Thanks,  JN

Subject:	Storage Injections

The VNG book should currently only have 4 injection tickets.

1. Forward sale to VNG (Paper inventory) - Sitara 699457 (Volumes are hedged-any deviations from the monthly volume need to 
	be communicated to Risk so that Tag can be altered)  Price is at index plus WAC of transport and injection variables.

Applies to following Sitara tickets	
Tickets  represents volumes that ENA borrowed at a zero price and are priced at injection costs. Volumes are hedged.  If the monthly volumes in the sitara tickets deviate from the original volumes, please communicate to Risk so that TAG can be adjusted to reflect the actual monthly injections.
Volumes are currently in at a  ratable injection schedule and can and should be adjusted to reflect the best 'economic' injection schedule. 

These tickets should not be put in as sales to VNG.

2.  Forward sale to Dominion - Sitara 725453
	
3.  TCO CPR Pipeline Exchange - Sitara 723220.  Serves same purpose as CNG injection ticket.  Please advice if this ticket should be 
a sale to TCO as opposed a CPR ticket to allow for proper scheduling.

4.  Transco WSS CPR Pipeline Exchange - Sitara 594261. Please advice if this ticket should be 
a sale to Transco as opposed a CPR ticket  to allow for proper scheduling

Sale to VNG and ENA injection tickets should not exceed the maximun quantity allowed to inject in all storages for the summer months.

Clarissa....can some one explain to me what Sitara 730186 represents? It looks like a sale to VNG.  Do this volumes need to be moved to
another ticket? Please advice.

"confirmation of WV gas","
John,
 
I still have not received written confirmation that the gas being supplied  to the Trust is 100% West Virginia Production.   You have assured me  verbally that such is the case.  However, I am sure that you understand  that it is not the least bit unreasonable to have such a certification in  writing.  I need such a written certification ASAP since  Mountaineer/Allegheny needs proof in order to provide the WV transportation  rate.
 
Please fax me such a certification today if at all possible.  If that  is not possible,  please send me an email stating that such a certification  will be signed in the next day or two.
 
I am attaching the memo that I faxed and emailed to you about a week ago  that I thought would facilitate getting the certification ASAP.
 
Thanks very much and regards,

To: S-2 Customers

Re: TETCO ASA and Global Settlement Filing Effective 12/1/01

On October 31, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed its annual Applicable Shrinkage Adjustment (ASA) 
and its final Order No. 636 Transition Cost filing in Docket No. 
RP02-36-0000.  Included in the filing were revised rates and ASA 
percentages designed to retain in-kind the projected quantities 
of gas required for the operation of TETCO's system, including 
percentages under Rate Schedule X-28 which Transco utilizes to 
render service under its Rate Schedule S-2.  The revised rates 
and fuel percentages have a proposed effective date of December 
1, 2001, and if accepted as proposed would result in the 
following changes in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 rates and fuel 
percentages: 

Injection Rate - $0.0020 decrease
Withdrawal Rate - $0.0048 decrease
Injection Fuel Percentage - 0.08% decrease
Inventory Level Fuel Percentage - 0.02% decrease
Withdrawal Fuel Percentages:
     Winter Period - 0.03% increase
     Spring, Summer and Fall Periods - 0.09% decrease

In response to FGT's letter of December 6 regarding contracts 5879, 6020, 6089, ENA will remarket the capacity using the capacity release mechanisms allowed in the normal course of business.

"Fort Pierce Pipeline Requirements","Ruth,

Welcome to the Fort Pierce Repowering Project, aka ""FPRP"", (now that John has become a traitor err trader).  The following list contains the latest and greatest natural gas needs for this project (if anyone copied notices any discrepancies with my information, I need to know yesterday <- that soon):

Pressure Requirements:  per the Mitsubishi 501F technical specs, required pressure at the inlet is 530psi, however, this does not include losses.  Therefore, the required pressure off of FGT's mainline needs to be 560psi.
Hourly Gas Requirements:  even though we have reviewed various turbine configurations, the amount of hourly gas needed for this project has managed to hover around 2,100mmbtu/hr using 16 hour/day run cycles.
Looping vs Lateral:  we are willing to defer to FGT's recommendation provided that a single meter configuration be used as opposed to a dual configuration.
Timing:  plans are for the plant to be running in a simple-cycle configuration by June '02 and a combined-cycle configuration by Sep '02.  Therefore, we will need pipeline construction completed by Apr '02 for start-up and testing.
Phase VI Strategy:  the plan has been to either get this construction rolled into the Phase VI expansion (it would be the first piece of Phase VI initiated in order to meet our time deadline) or to have the construction covered by FGT's blanket for normal construction.
FGT Deadline:  It is my understanding that FGT needs to finalize the Phase VI plans by April 30, 2001.  

That is everything that comes to mind at this time. If you or anyone has any comments, changes, questions or interesting anecdotes, let me know.

Thanks,
Mathew

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

   I've followed up on the arbitration issue.  We can delete arbitration if
   SOCO will agree to exclusive venue in the state courts of Harris County,
   Texas or the federal courts in the Southern District of Texas.

   I'm only in the office till 1pm CST today and then I'm out for the

   I'll push this through to get it finalized before I leave today if at
   all

      Outside counsel needs the number and I asked what he in fact needs --
      I'd
      assumed EIN.  However, he actually needs the organizational ID number
   (I
      guess that's what it is called) assigned by the secretary of state
      (probably) when the company is formed.  The number may be found in
   the
      articles of incorporation.  If you can't find the numbers in the

cc:	Cynthia Franklin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT 

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

John - Apologies for the long note below but I believe it will be useful to get into the detail to resolve our Colonial recall issues.

Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.

Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.

Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.

Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.

Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.

Thank you - Scott Dozier

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

"NYSEG","John-
I have been helping David Draper to review the NYSEG positions we currently have, and accurately reflect our exposure, based on LDC restrictions.  The one factor that I hope you can help with is the physical constraints in delivering gas to NYSEG off of certain pipes.  It appears as if most of our position is based upon deliveries off CNG, which I don't believe has any physical constraints.  However, we also have small positions requiring us to deliver off of TCO, Iroquois and Algonquin.

Based on the pricing I see in RGS, there is obviously some issue with delivering off of TCO in the winter.  I'm wondering if you can help explain this, as well as any other issues you are aware of here.  

It's probably easiest to talk through it rather than e-mail about it, but I assumed you were trading.  You can call me at x35514 when you have some time.  (If David has already contacted you about this, let me know and you don't have to repeat yourself.)

The rumors of my demise have been greatly exagerated!  Congrats to Maxfield
as we knew all along which conference was the stronger.  I will net out all
""outstanding"" debts against Eric's schedule.  However, I refuse to pay out
any winnings until all accounts have been settled.  I will not get stuck
holding the empty bag; I understand now why Eric didn't want to have
anything to do with the money.  I trust everyone can read this e-mail and
deduce
how much you owe me.  I will give the ""outstanding"" franchises until Jan.
4th to contact me and arrange payment terms without being disgraced by
having
their names mentioned as being ""outstanding"" at this point of the season.  I
would prefer to not mention any names, GRASS, unless I have to!

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Re: Colonial Outstanding AR","Yes.  That would be good.  However, John and I have spoken and Dick Jenkins and I have spoken.  I have confirmation from both of these traders that the mechanism for the recall was to purchase the gas back at an agreed price, different from the sell price (creating multiple back-to-backs with Colonial).  Therefore, the way these items sit in our system seems correct.  Furthermore, I have left a message with Colonial's accountant (Fri May 11) on this stating our position and that they needed to work internally to determine if there should be a conversation between our marketers and their marketers.

I think it might be useful for you, Meredith, and I to sit down and talk about specific paths for these items, especially Dec/00.  At the very least that would help me put my ducks in a row when I am talking to Colonial about collection on Dec/00.  Under our current position Colonial owes us for Dec-00.  Wednesday is good for me.

Thanks.

Scott,
Meredith Homco and I both were working on Tetco during the December 00 and March 01. Meredith mentioned to me that she had gone over some items regarding this issue previously with someone is settlements.  I'd like for us to get with her and see if we can't get this resolved faster with her involvement. I'm out of the office today at an off site customer meeting but could be available tomorrow.  Meredith -- what does your schedule look like Wednesday afternoon? Can you save 10-20 minutes for me and Scott. Please let me know you availability.

Cindy

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

John - Apologies for the long note below but I believe it will be useful to get into the detail to resolve our Colonial recall issues.

Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.

Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.

Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.

Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.

Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.

Thank you - Scott Dozier

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

"Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts","Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

I need to lock in TCO pool supply for my customer starting April 02 through July 04. Yes, this term is correct and they in fact want to lock this in soon (at the latest Tuesday morning). I have attached their load profile below. They are looking for a Nymex plus applicable basis quote. BUT, they want seasonal pricing (i.e. a winter quote and a separate summer quote). In other words they want to see 5 different prices (Apr02-Oct02, Nov02-Mar03, Apr03-Oct03, Nov03-Mar04, and Apr04-Jul04). I hope this makes sense and if you have any questions please call me at 502-214-6364 or send me an e-mail. Thanks for your help in advance.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Organization Announcement","Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

"Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement for MEGS Pipeline (Project Pluto)","Kevin,

Attached please find an intial draft of a purchase and sale agreement for the MEGS pipeline (Project Pluto).  The document is based on the form of the agreement that was used when we purchased the asset.  For review purposes, I have also included a comparison version to show the differences between the agreements.

There are several issues that we need to discuss.  As a summary, these include:

- In the purchase and sale agreement, you will note areas (e.g., the recitals, schedules and exhibits) where I have noted that further text remains to be drafted.  In particular, we need to discuss those schedules that identify what documents and contracts we have disclosed to Duke, given that LJM at one point in time was the indirect beneficial owner of this asset through it's one time ownership of MEGS LLC (see Section 3.15 disclosure statement);

- Sections 2.2, 3.10 and 11 require Jerry Seade's tax review;

- Whether for credit purposes, we need some form of payment guaranty / commitment letter from the parent company of Duke Energy Field Services (see section 7.4(g));

- The assignment agreements that will be required for the Gathering, O&M and Guaranty Agreements.  Per the terms of the Gathering and O&M Agreements, no counter-party consents are required; however, a consent will be necessary for the Guaranty Agreement.

I would suggest that we try to meet later this afternoon to discuss this agreement (I am tied up until 1:30 or so.)   Thanks.

 

Comparison Version:

"RE: Enron MW/Peoples Master","Gregg/Richard, great work on getting Peoples to work with us.  I will look for a copy of their letter requesting assurance that you mentioned.  Please let me know what PGL decides about buying the NSS inventory (13.5 Bcf).

Until we hear from them, please do the following:
(1) Identify alternative Jan/Feb NSS markets for as much as you can withdraw.  Hopefully PGLC will buy the inventory as planned, but if they do not we need to have alternatives worked out.  
(2) Detail your plans for liquidating the inventory in the PGL Hub (3.78 Bcf - enovate 1.08 Bcf and EMW 2.7 Bcf).  As part of that, please provide details on the total already committed to (a) physical baseload sales, (b) physical option sales and (c) remaining inventory.  Regardless of the hedges that were in place, we need to get any uncommitted gas out of the ground and sold (preferably pre-pay) as soon as possible.
(3) Forward copies of the documents which evidence our rights and obligations under the three storage agreements (EMW/NSS, EMW/ PGL Hub and enovate/PGL Hub).  If no documents exist, please forward any documentation (correspondence, emails, copies of invoices, etc.) which would evidence Enron's to the to the inventory.  Please fax any such documentation to me at 713-646-3460.     

Please complete the above in time for us to discuss sometime Friday.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

Subject:	Enron MW/Peoples Master

As everyone is aware, Peoples provided notification to Enron MW, L.L.C. of its desire for credit support or termination effective December 28th of the Master Physical Agreement between EMW and PGL.  Richard and I met with Raulie, Dave and Tim this morning to discuss the implications of the termination and our ability to continue to fulfill our obligations regarding the deals that are subject to the Master.  After much discussion, they (PGL) have agreed to delay any termination until either the end of January or February (they are going to discuss internally which makes more sense).  Therefore, unless a higher power overturns our agreement, PGL intends to issue a letter amending their previous notification/assurance letter.  If anyone has any questions or comments, please let Richard or me know at your earliest convenience.

Thanks  - Gregg

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"FW: Enron de Mexico - Legal and Regulatory Allocations","FYI...

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Williams, Jaime  
Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 5:38 PM
To:	Killen, Faith
Cc:	Helton, Susan; Irvin, Steve; Vu, Nancy H.
Subject:	Enron de Mexico - Legal and Regulatory Allocations

Hello Faith, I want to mention to that a couple of weeks ago, Louise Kitchen mentioned to me that we should review the Outside Legal and Regulatory cost allocations for our group, since the ammounts previously allocated were impacting our budget in a very important way.  I touched base with Susan Helton, who touched base with you and we were instructed to talk to legal (Jeff Hodge) and to Regulatory Affairs (Rick Shapiro), and so I did. They both listened to our 2002 business plan, and revised our numbers.

The cost allocation for Outside Legal that Jeff Hodge (and Mark Haediecke) are proposing for Enron de Mexico, for 2002 is $133,000 USD.
The cost allocation for Regulatory Affairs for the same period, proposed by Rick Shapiro, is $250,000.

I hope this is OK with you, but please do not hesitate to give me a call at your convenience.

Best regards.

"CGLF for tomorrow","I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.  For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.  After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.


Here are the deal numbers and volumes.


Deal		Current Vol	After Cuts	Comment
1149149	21,000		10,000		Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach.
1143923	31,000		20,000		Mainline to Leach Transport
1143924	49,798		38,469		Onshore to Mainline - volume may be off a little, just need to balance mainline
1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.


I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.  


Thanks for your support.

"Legal Specialist Position","Mr. Hodge,

Eric Boyt mentioned that you would assist in making sure my resume was
forwarded to the right people regarding the Legal Specialist position
posted on the Enron website.  I want to take this opportunity to thank you
for doing so.  You will find a copy of my resume attached below.

I worked as a consultant in the Law Department of one of the larger Energy
companies here in Houston for over two years.  In this role, I assisted in
the management of three FTC document productions regarding mergers and
acquisitions, gathered relevant documents to assist in the divestiture
process related to these mergers, and also monitored a docket of over 100
cases.  These cases involved bankruptcy, environmental, garnishments,
employment, and other general litigation issues.  Additionally, I was
responsible for monthly status reports to the client regarding my team's
work efforts and conducted in-depth interviews of several of the business
units as part of the merger productions.

Recently, I have been working on document reviews to assist in building
economic damages models.

Again, I would like to thank you for your attention to this matter.  If you
have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email or via my work
phone (713.646.5014).

Sincerely,
Jeff Coltharp

"Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14","Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Subject:	Enron MW/Peoples Master

As everyone is aware, Peoples provided notification to Enron MW, L.L.C. of its desire for credit support or termination effective December 28th of the Master Physical Agreement between EMW and PGL.  Richard and I met with Raulie, Dave and Tim this morning to discuss the implications of the termination and our ability to continue to fulfill our obligations regarding the deals that are subject to the Master.  After much discussion, they (PGL) have agreed to delay any termination until either the end of January or February (they are going to discuss internally which makes more sense).  Therefore, unless a higher power overturns our agreement, PGL intends to issue a letter amending their previous notification/assurance letter.  If anyone has any questions or comments, please let Richard or me know at your earliest convenience.

Looking at the entire transport curve was very beneficial.  They have definitely tilted the majority of costs for most areas to the Dec - Feb time frame, which is representative of this type of retail market.  On average for the season and/or the year, the transport costs are reasonable.  Let me know if I can provide any other help.

John--
Thanks so much for the information you provided to me yesterday.  It was most helpful (although I have to tell you that the people here defended their prices and still feel they are appropriate).

Anyway, since we are trying to move them toward a ""market based"" approach to the valuation of capacity (rather than an average cost of what they have paid), I would appreciate it immensely if you could look at the attachment and give feedback.  The attachment shows a one year transport curve for each of the various zones/market areas where EES is currently doing business.  Hopefully this will give you a better picture of what they really have in their system, and help resolve or dispute their argument that the shape of EES' curve justifies the fact that they may be off in just the one month of data that I gave to you yesterday.

I'm trying to finalize COH's curve validation early next week, so let me know if you can get to it by then or not.  By the way, this would be much easier if you'd just come to Retail and do the transport here...!!!

Thanks again for your help

"Ordering beyond December 2001","
I just got off the phone with Darren Vanek.  We have been talking  about what is needed for about a month now.  Almost two weeks ago he said  he wanted a contract that allowed him to call for a letter of credit if one were  needed in the future and that would suffice.
 
Apparently, a paralegal, is involved in generating such a contract and she  was out all of last week.  Darren said that he has no control over when the  contract actually gets sent to me.  Please do what you can to expedite the  emailing of that contract to me so that I can order gas beyond Dec. 2001.

The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Personal News","Although this is definitely not the best way to announce it, today is my last day at Enron Canada Corp. and I wanted to let you know that it has been a real pleasure working with you over the last couple of years.  I apologize for letting you know by e-mail instead of giving you a call.  Unfortunately, the mechanics of my employment change required me to avoid phoning you all earlier.  

Just so you know, I am returning to my old job in the world of private practice at Bennett Jones LLP here in Calgary.  I do not have my new e-mail address or phone number yet but you can reach me at the main switchboard at (403) 298-3100 starting December 3, 2001.  My mugshot, direct line and e-mail address should be appearing on the Bennett Jones website (www.bennettjones.ca) within the next month.  In the meantime, I will be taking a couple of weeks to spend with my wife and 3 month old son Jimmy.

I wish nothing but the best for you and if you ever find yourself in the Great White North of Calgary, please give me a call.

All the best,

I have confirmed the meeting with Williams to discuss the Athens and Hart Co. projects for 3:00 on Wednesday.  Location TBA.  We will meet with Allen Smith and Orlando (Alvarez?).

Regarding the Midway project in St. Lucie County (and other sites as well)  we need to get a rough estimate on the estimated schedule for completion.  In particular, we need to know whether it is possible to get gas to the Midway site by May 2002.  Is there any way we can talk to someone today about this?


Thanks.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Subject:	RE: Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts

This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the issue of Transportation Contract rejection with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews and Kurth.  He and his partner Jeff Spiers have been advising other Enron divisions regarding the contract rejection process.  

I am told that a motion has been filed with the bankruptcy court requesting that shorthand procedures be established for the purpose of allowing the various Enron Debtors to reject executory contracts.  That motion is apparently slated to be heard on January 7.  The attached template describes the information that must be filed with the court and forwarded to the creditors' committee and to the relevant counterparty whose contract is being rejected.  Assuming that the order is approved, we'll be able to start rejecting transportation contracts as early as January 8.  

Kelli and Maria,

In order to expedite the process, could you please fill out the attached template, providing the information requested. 

Please call with any questions.

Thanks for your help.

Attached is an e:mail that I forwarded to Jeff Speirs, a bankruptcy attorney with Andrews and Kurth who will be assisting with the mechanics of rejecting the out of the money transportation agreements that you all have identified.  I imagine that we will need full company names, contact persons and addresses in order to place the different pipes on notice of the motion to reject.  Could you please coordinate the gathering of this information so that we will be in a position to act on it as soon as possible after New Years?  Thanks for your help.

Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

"Solar Migration - Third Notice - Time Change!!!!!","
	During the weekend of October 6 and 7, 2001 the Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating all production users off the current hardware (Solar) that houses their home and application directories (no production databases are affected, but client software will be) to new hardware.	

	This migration requires a total system outage of approximately 6 hours.  The outage will occur Saturday night - beginning at 7:00 PM and will last until Sunday morning at 1:00 AM.  All users will need to be logged off during this time period. 
	In order to validate the migration, production users need to test access to their home directories and applications on Sunday, October 7, 2001.  If you do you experience any difficulties after the migration with access to home directories or applications, please call the resolution center at 713 853-1411.  The resolution center will notify the appropriate resources.

	The following attachment is a list of the mount points affected.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"RE: Master Firm Agreements","Jeff,

I've been talking with Russ Severson of the Sitara team and he will be forwarding a list to me of all the hierarchies for Sitara auto-attaching logic.  Right now GISB agreements have the lowest priority, a ""3"", but I want a listing of ALL priorities for our contracts so that I can ensure that the GISB will always be the last choice if there are other masters.  As soon as I have that information, I will let you know so that you can pass on the information to Louise Kitchen.  In the meantime, we are also trying to meet with Tom Engel of EOL to ensure that the EOL Profile Manager data is bridging to Sitara and Global Contracts correctly.

Please call if you have any questions.  I will let you know what I hear from Russ and Tom.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Just in case you have not seen this.  We need to look at the auto attachment rules for contracts.

Stacey and Ellen:

	In light of current circumstances, if a counterparty has both a Master Firm and a GISB, please confirm all firm physical transactions (both telephonic and EOL) under the Master Firm and not the GISB.

	Additionally, could one of you provide me a list of EOL counterparties who have a GISB contract listed as their master agreement for EOL.

Thanks,

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

"Final Form of Adoption Agreement for Gas","Jeff and Deb,

Please use the attached form of Adoption agreement when dealing with Gas Masters; it adds a missing ""of"" in Section 4 and it Triangularizes the Set Off provision, which we think will ultimately be a positive feature in ""selling"" the form to a counterparty. . . especially a counterparty who already has a power and/or financial master in place with ENA/EPMI.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the attached.

"RE: Master Firm Agreements","Attention Deal Compliance and Deal Validation:

New Procedure!!
Pursuant to Jeff Hodge's email below, effective Tuesday, November 6, for all counterparties with both a Master Firm contract and a GISB, all FIRM deals (EOL and telephonic), regardless of length (including one day deals) should be attached to the Master Firm contract.  With respect to EOL deals, Profile Manager has been updated to accommodate this change.  For counterparties with only a GISB as a master, you may continue attaching firm deals up to one month in duration.



Jeff,

Pursuant to your message below, I have updated EOL Profile Manager as follows:

Counterparty					Remove GISB		Add Master Firm
Consolidated Energy Solutions, Inc.		96029232		96002347	
Equitable Gas Company				96029557		96003499
ICC Energy Corporation				96028949		96000633
Innovative Gas Services, Inc.			96021962		96003168
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P.		96029028		96001565
Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.		96028966		96028965
Questar Energy Trading Company		96029033		96001878
TotalFina Gas & Power North America, Inc.	96029083		96000448
U.S. Gas Transportation, Inc.			96029469		96011824


As requested, here is a list of counterparties using GISBs as masters in EOL.

 
If you have any questions or need additional information, please call me at ext. 5-9989.

Regards,
Susan Elledge

Stacey and Ellen:

	In light of current circumstances, if a counterparty has both a Master Firm and a GISB, please confirm all firm physical transactions (both telephonic and EOL) under the Master Firm and not the GISB.

	Additionally, could one of you provide me a list of EOL counterparties who have a GISB contract listed as their master agreement for EOL.

Thanks,

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Bryce,

I spoke with Scott Borgmeyer of Florida Power and Light and FPL Energy Power Mktg.
concerning their payments that are due on December 17th and December 26th.
 According to Scott, they will not be making payments to us on these days due to the termination 
of their contract effective December 12th.  They will not be paying at this time due to unwinding 
arrangements of terminated contracts.  Payment amounts due are as follows:

December 17th	$21,064,010.57  FP&L

December 26th  $ 6,965,765.30   FP&L

December 26th  $     22,077.24   FPL Energy Power Marketing

Thanks,

Max

"RE: Contract Review","I will not be in the office today (on my schedule) due to doctor appointments for my children.  I will be available on Thursday to discuss.  I have been coordinating with Gregg Penman, Richard Tomaski, Hunter Shively, Jeff Hodge, Lou Stoler, etc. and will set a meeting for Thursday to discuss how to proceed regarding PEC.  My assistant will coordinate the meeting.  I do not want this contract/s discussed in a large group due to the confidential nature and the protection of the ongoing Chicago business.  Don, I need someone to provide Irena with the name of a bankruptcy attorney who can attend.
 
I appreciate your understanding on this matter.

                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 08, 2001

Notice ID: 3163
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the
specified dates.

SUBJECT:   2002 TENTATIVE OUTAGE SCHEDULE

In February 2002, Columbia's Line BM-22 in Martin Co., KY will be out of
service due to Highway relocation for three (3) days resulting in a reduction
of approximately 23,000 Dth/d of production flowing through Kermit Compressor.
This includes the following lines: P-94, V-55 and BM-18.

In the spring of 2002, contingent upon the mining activity, Columbia's Line KA
will be out of service for three (3) days due to a coal mining relocation tie
in.  Approximately 100,000 Dth/d of Appalachian production west of the May Fork
valve on Line KA will be shut in.

In the spring of 2002, Columbia's Boldman Compressor located in Pike Co., KY,
will have one unit down for approximately two (2) months for annual maintenance
which results in a 15,000 Dth/d flow reduction.  Affected is Equitable's Hi-Hat
(F3) pipeline, CNR's Boldman (CNR02) pipeline, and Appalachian production
located on Columbia's Lines PM-3 and PM-17.

In May-June 2002, Columbia's Line's BM-18, Line VM-141 and Line V-55 will be
out of service for five (5) days due to a relocation for WV Rt. 52 in Mingo
Co., WV.  The affect, if any, on production is being evaluated.

In July 2002, Line 1711 will be out of service for three (3) days due to a
relocation of the Monongahela River crossing tie in.  The affect, if any, on
production is being evaluated.

The following outages affect Equitable's Beaver Creek (H1) pipeline, and
Appalachian production from Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station to Columbia's
Huff Creek Compressor Station on Line KA, including Line KA-15.

In March 2002, Columbia anticipates an outage of three (3) days on Columbia's
Line SM-116 as a result of coal mining activity.  In addition to the above
listed production, Conoco's Grant (P1) pipeline and Appalachian production
located on Line SM-116 will be affected.

In June 2002, Columbia's Grant Compressor located in Mingo Co., WV will have
one unit out of service for six (6) days which will result in a 50,000 Dth/d
flow reduction.

In August 2002, Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor located in Wyoming Co., WV
will be out of service for one (1) week due to annual maintenance.

In the fall of 2002, Columbia's Line KA will be out of service for three (3)
days due to relocation for a highway expansion project on Rt. 119.   The
relocation is between Johns Creek and Canada, which will result in 100,000
Dth/d of production shut in west of the May Fork valve setting.

"ENA Upstream and Linder Oil Company--Dunhill--Aquila","Jeff,

Mary Alba in Client Services forwarded two letters for me to handle.  One is a Letter In Lieu of Transfer and Division Orders from Linder and Dunhill regarding certain properties they sold to Dunhill Resources I, LLC as of 11/01/01.  I have requested an executed copy from the counterparty, but I have not received it yet.  Also received was a Notice of Assignment of Proceeds between Aquila and Dunhill with payment instructions.  We are supposed to execute and return this one to Aquila.

There are seven November Physical Forward transactions that I believe are affected by these notices.  There are also three December deals with Linder.  Are they still valid deals?  

Please review the letters and let me know how to proceed.  An 8 page fax is on the way.

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Pete,

Attached please find my comments and suggested revisions for the Master
Netting Agreement with Enron.  I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same
comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the
provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with
someone from Enron or someone in our shop.

For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes
focused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we
should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for
example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron
Energy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we
may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and
Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an
exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect
at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks.

Ernie

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Subject:	KeySpan agreements

Hi Jeff,

I was cleaning off the desk of one of my coworkers who was laid off and found two letters from KeySpan that she had not handled.  They were both from Charles Daverio, KeySpan Utility Services LLC as agent for The Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  One letter is a termination of a master agreement between ENA and The Brooklyn Union Gas Company, dated 12/01/88, with the termination effective 10/31/04.  The other is an alternative contract quantity election effective 11/01/01 for a master agreement dated 12/08/88.  I cannot locate either of these agreements in our system.  KeySpan Utility Services LLC, as agent or otherwise, is not set up in the Global Counterparty system at all.  None of our Brooklyn Union agreements even come close in date to the ones referenced in these letters.

In light of our current situation, I wanted to check with you to see if you knew anything about either agreement being referenced.  I certainly do not wish to call the counterparty and it probably does not even matter at this point.  I do plan to send these documents to the file room, but without a contract number to file them under, the file room will not know what to do with the documentation.

Please advise.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Fwd: Env, Energy, and Resources BOG request","Great news!

Yesterday, Dana Jonusaitis, Section Director, sent me a message (see
attached) letting me know that the ABA Board of Governors has approved
the Section's request (also attached) to seek a grant of up to $25,000
from the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to develop a
public service project. The subject areas for this year's grants will be
announced by the CEC in early 2002.  (Last year's grant subject areas
were marine protected areas and children's health and the environment).

Once the CEC announces the proposed subject areas, I will contact the
relevant Committee public service vice chair to enlist their aid in
putting together the grant proposal and the public service project.

For more information on the CEC and the grant process, please check out:

Happy holidays!

Kam/Alejandra,  This deal should probably be zero effective Nov 2001.  I believe it's a dupe to 139683 on CGAS..Volumes now are zero on 139693.  It's a sale to Hopewell that was created in December 1999 but it has a hedge N59964 and a demand charge attached to it that should be taken out.  THANKS

Subject:	FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 24, 12:00 PM
FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

"Crawfish Plant Filing","Dear Patrick:  Yesterday I spoke with the Office of Conservation at the Louisiana Dept. of Natural Resources about the Crawfish Plant.  As you may recall from our phone conversation several weeks ago, we (LRCI, Inc.) have been assessed with a civil penalty for failure to file an R6 report in July.  La. faxed me a copy of the June report, and it shows a balance of 29 barrels of oil at the plant.  We can't close out the filings with the state until the R6 report shows a balance of zero barrels.  

I've spoken with Annette Thompson in accounting, the specialist who signed the June, 2001 R6 report, and she said she's in the process of determining exactly how to report the disposition of those last 29 barrels of oil.  In the meantime, I've prepared a payment request form to go through the ipayit system for a check in the amount of $250.00, the civil penalty.  This can accompany our final filing when it's ready.  

When the check comes back for coding, should I sent it along to you for approval under your work order (WBS element) number?  Please tell me what that is so I can input the information.

Many thanks.  I'll call you when the check and final R6 form (from Annette Thompson), and the change of filing status form for the Crawfish Plant are ready.

Best wishes,
Mary

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Greg's title is Supervisor, Corporate Credit & Financial Services, Phone (281) 293-6897
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
Thanks,

"FW: NFUL for Sep","When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th, its short by 9189.  TCO is long by 9189 for the same time frame.

Part of the problem is deal 1016655.  I can see that the volumes on the deal for the 1st thru the 4th, but they don't show up in Unify.  These volumes also do not show up on my P&L.  My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is (36,846  roughly 9189 x 4 days).

TRCO Team,  would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for the 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please?  I would like to see if that has an impact.

"RE: Enron GISB drafts","Greg can you se me about this.  MS wants a Master in place before they will transact with us for physical gas.  They have proposed the GISB.

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%

Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:

---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"FW: Southern Companies Services","Carol & Jeff -

I received the below email from Priscilla Hamic regarding Southern Company Services.  It appears that they are not going to pay for November delivered gas, as they want to unwind/net across entities.  We don't have any cross-company netting agreements with Southern Company, so they don't have the right to do this. 

Do we need to send them a letter advising the same?  What should we do with respect to this?  


Thanks,

JRW

David/Richard:

I hope you had a good time on the hunt and made it home in time for the service.  We'll try to do another hunt behind dogs later in the season.  To follow up on our discussions with PNP, I have proposed a Letter Agreement which defines one basic structure for the deal.  This is definitely open to discussion and I would like your input.

When Richard visits tomorrow, I would like to review the pro forma we have developed for the transaction.  The pro forma is a work in process - but provides a good start on understanding the total project value as well as the return to each party.  If we can agree the basic structure of the deal, we then need to agree the commercial assumptions and how the revenue stream from the sale of oil and gas is to be provided.

After you have had a chance to review, I will arrange a visit to take any comments.

Regards,
Brian

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Subject:	Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (""Morgan"")

I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the ""mini-netting"" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this ""mini-netting"" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.

"Fort Pierce Lateral","John,

If a message was relayed to you that I said you had promised that the Fort Pierce lateral would be included in the Phase VI expansion, I want to apologize for this misunderstanding.  I am fully aware that you have told me from the very beginning that having FGT pay for the cost of the lateral would be a push.  I was not implying, nor did I ever intend to imply, that you had ever promised getting this included in Phase VI or under FGT's blanket.  I have always known it would take some work and hope that this misinformation has not caused you undo grief.

Thank you for your understanding,

"LC Update","Ed and Bill:
Per Leslie reeves, we did receive a payment from LG&E Energy Marketing so the only issue remaining on them is whether the LC has been renewed.  As Ed reported, El Paso renewed their LC so there is nothing to do on that.  With respect to Enserco, I faxed the proposed new LC to ed and spoke with Don Perkins, their credit manager (303) 568-3255.  I told him that he may be receiving a call from you regarding Fortis, the Issuer.  I also told him that drawing condition #1 would have to change to take out the reference to delivery of natural gas and he agreed.  He was also going to talk to Lynn Evans, his attorney, about the procedures that need to be followed under 'Special Instructions"" as I do not think that we should be sending anything to Fortis.  More to come tomorrow.


Ed:
Please e-mail me, Sara and Jeff a description of where things stand with Niagara based on their payment today as it sounds complicated and may require us to piece together all of the contracts we have with them before deciding how to proceed.

Notice ID: 3184
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION
                              NOTICE OF OPEN SEASON
                                 Midwest Project

                                October 16, 2001



OVERVIEW

Columbia is conducting an open season in conjunction with CMS Panhandle
Companies (""CMS Panhandle"") that would path natural gas supplies from the
MidContinent production and Chicago Hub areas into Ohio.  Columbia's system is
connected to CMS Panhandle via multiple points in western Ohio.  Columbia
intends to offer this as a ""seamless"" service, whereby Columbia would manage
the nomination and billing service for this linked path between CMS Panhandle
and Columbia.  Due to the multiple transportation paths available into
Columbia's system via the CMS Panhandle system, Columbia is requesting that
interested parties submit their requests for capacity and service in accordance
with the terms set forth below.  In the event the preferred receipt path is
beyond the service that can be provided by either CMS Panhandle or Columbia,
Columbia may look to extend the supply path, as necessary, by including other
transportation providers.


LENGTH OF OPEN SEASON

The open season period will commence on Friday, October 12, 2001, and close at
4:30 p.m. E.T. on Friday, December 14, 2001. During the open season, interested
parties desiring service should submit a request form in accordance with the
minimum requirements set forth in this notice.


SERVICE DESCRIPTION

Subject to the terms of this open season and depending on the interest
expressed through completed request forms, Columbia will evaluate the
possibility of using either existing or new capacity for service under its Firm
Transportation Service (""FTS"") Rate Schedule from its west receipt points into
Ohio, located at Crossroads, Cecil, Maumee, and Lebanon. The open season
targets Market Areas 1 through 9 and 15 in Ohio and Northern Kentucky,
respectively. Columbia would also consider requests for summer service
(April-October), where practical.

Columbia also will evaluate non-binding proposals from existing customers to
turn back firm capacity under existing service agreements that may reduce the
amount of capacity for which facilities would need to be constructed. However,
any such proposal(s) would have to be compatible with the specific terms of any
project that Columbia may ultimately propose.


CONTRACT TERM/SERVICE COMMENCEMENT

The suggested minimum contract term that Columbia will consider is ten (10)
years. The minimum term will depend on the need, or not, for new facilities to
be constructed. Parties submitting a request form should indicate a preferred
service commencement date, with the earliest commencement date being December
31, 2001 (if existing capacity on the Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if
necessary, other transportation providers, can be used to accommodate the
requested service).


RATES

Rates will be derived in accordance with Columbia's and CMS Panhandle's FERC
Gas Tariff, based upon an evaluation of requests for service and capital
expenditures necessary to meet such requests.


PARTICIPATION IN THE OPEN SEASON

To participate in Columbia's open season, interested parties desiring service
should submit a request, which includes the following items, by 4:30 p.m. E.T.
on Friday, December 14, 2001:

1. One completed request form (attached), with specific attention to the
   primary term of service, service commencement date, total capacity
  requested, and the desired receipt and delivery point(s);

2. One completed Credit Application Form (attached), to be submitted only by
   interested parties that do not currently receive service from Columbia.



REQUEST FORM ASSESSMENT/FINALIZING SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS

Upon the close of the open season, Columbia will assess the requests for
service. Columbia will evaluate the system and capital requirements necessary
to provide requested service and develop rates and terms and conditions of
service based on the required system enhancements. If, in Columbia's sole
discretion, there is enough interest to justify going forward, Columbia will
notify parties that submitted request forms as to their award of any existing
or expansion capacity. In the event requests for capacity exceed the amount of
expansion capacity that Columbia can economically construct and make available,
available expansion capacity will be allocated on a non-discriminatory basis.

All parties awarded capacity will be required to enter into binding precedent
agreements and service agreements with Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if
necessary, other transportation providers to complete the path. Such agreements
must be executed and returned to Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other
transportation service providers, as deemed necessary, within a designated
period of time; otherwise, an award of capacity will be subject to rejection.
All binding precedent agreements and service agreements entered into as a
result of the open season must reflect an arm's-length transaction between the
requesting party and Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other transportation service
providers, as deemed necessary. Following the return of executed agreements,
Columbia may reallocate any remaining available capacity (if any), but will not
be obligated to do so. During the open season, affiliates of Columbia shall be
required to request capacity on the same basis as non-affiliates; that is, an
affiliate's request shall be evaluated using the same criteria used to evaluate
non-affiliates' requests. To effectuate a seamless service for nomination and
billing purposes, Shippers will name Columbia as agent for Shipper under any
necessary upstream transportation agreements on CMS Panhandle.

Subject: RE: follow up



Hi Andy. Thank you for the very nice message. All is very well in

Austin. How's Houston and the horse? Hope we can get down to Houston

soon. Have you gotten to meet Ella yet?

By the way, I finally got to make a C-BAR presentation to Bracewell in

Houston, which Marcy organizated, and the firm is now actively involved.

I really like Marcy--she is very cool.  Your message reminded me of

ENRON and how I have sent a couple of unanswered messages to Jim Derrick

at the recommendation of Scott Atlas to see if we can get get Enron

attorneys involved and/or to get an Enron attorney to serve on our

Houston advisory board. I believe Scott said he had talked to Jim about

2 years ago about getting Enron to partner with V&E attorneys on

transactional pro bono matters. Scott said Jim sounded interested and

suggested I contact him as well. What is the current status of pro bono

there? We work very closely with V&E and are still very interested in

the partnership model.   Attached is additional info for corporate

counsel and the role they can play in C-BAR.

On the advisory board front, we are currently looking for transactional

attorneys to serve on a new Houston advisory board for C-BAR as well as

a newly restructured statewide operating board.  Would love to have an

Enron attorney serve on one of the boards.  The quick and easy low down

is that the advisory board is a very minimal commitment with 1-2

meetings a year in Houston, and the operating board will serve as a more

traditional operating board, with 4 meetings a year.  More info is

below.

Any recommendations of Enron attorneys??  Here's more background on

C-BAR and the boards:

Texas Community Building with Attorney Resources (""Texas C-BAR"") is a

statewide pro bono initiative for corporate counsel and other business

law/transactional attorneys. The mission of our organization is

two-fold: (1) Empower low income people and strengthen low income

neighborhoods in Texas by providing pro bono legal services to

community-based nonprofits in Texas that serve low income individuals

and communities, with an emphasis on affordable housing development

activities; and (2) Provide attorneys who have specialized transactional

skills with increased opportunities to apply these skills to benefit low

income communities.

Since Texas C-BAR was founded in 2000, Legal Aid of Central Texas has

been our sponsoring organization, but Texas C-BAR is a statewide project

and operates with an independent advisory board.  Now that Texas C-BAR

has gotten off the ground, we are working on building 3 regional

advisory boards as well as a new statewide operating board to help us

build on our first-year successes and explore ways to expand our pro

bono opportunities for transactional lawyers.  Serving on the board of

C-BAR offers attorneys the opportunity to be part of an exciting,

innovative project.  As the only statewide business law project in

Texas, attorneys who serve on our boards will be able to play an

influential role in the future of business law pro bono and have a

long-term, positive impact on low income neighborhoods throughout the

state. Information about the duties of these boards follows:

        Operating Board

        A.      Expectations:

                1.      3-year staggered terms; maximum of 2 terms

                2.      Serve on at least one committee (executive

committee, development, nominations, outreach)

                3.      Attend board meetings (quarterly meetings)

                4.      Participate in special events for C-BAR

                5.      Public Relations: be an advocate for the

organization in the community

                6.      Fundraising****

                        a.      actively participate in C-BAR

including fundraising

                8.      Guide the development of C-BAR

project of Legal Aid of Central Texas, which has its own operating

board)

        Regional Advisory Boards:

        A.      Three regions: Houston, Dallas-FW, Central Texas

(Austin-SA)

        B.      Expectations:

                1.      3-year staggered terms

                2.      Attend 1-2 advisory board meetings a year in the

region

                3.      Public Relations: be an advocate for the

organization in the community

                4.      Fundraising: assist with the fundraising

activities of the operating board, as requested

                5.      Assist with outreach to attorneys/nonprofits

Heather -

I just heard that the Texas Lawyer listed you as one of the top 40

lawyers in the state under the age of 40.  Although I have not seen or

read the article,  that is a terrific accomplishment.  Congratulations.

The work you do provides an incredible service to the community and you

deserve all the accolades.

Hope all is well in Austin.  Please give my best to Bill.

Rio Bravo Pipeline agreed to all the changes to the CA except the two year term.  Their reasoning is that it will take almost three years to build the pipeline, so they want to make sure the CA covers the entire timeframe before the pipeline is in-service.  As we discussed last week, keeping the term at three years is not something that ENA cannot live with.  With that in mind, I told them that ENA would agree to the three year term.

Please initial so that I can get Frank to sign.  We are trying to get this faxed down to El Paso's Mexico office this morning.

Subject:	TGT - Cashout Pricing Rejected by FERC

I wanted to let you know that the filing by Texas Gas Transmission to use GAS DAILY pricing for cashout  was REJECTED by FERC.    So please disregard the cashout information that was included on the PIPELINE SUMMARY you received at our meeting last Monday.
TGT submitted another new filing which proposes using weekly averages in Natural Gas Week and also proposes changing the tiers.  TGT wants to implement this retroactive to October1st.   Numerous entities have filed oppositions to this proposed TGT tariff change.     So at this time,  the method to be used by TGT for cashouts is uncertain.   
I will let you know when a cashout methodology gets final approval by FERC.

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Subject: Re: VNG


Frank, 
     Sequent is extremely interested in an early termination of the Enron/AGLES contract covering the asset management of the VNG.
We are in the process of evaluating a proposal to Enron and hope to have something to you shortly.  I will keep in touch.  Thanks

Dana, I wanted to follow up on our conversation of last week relative to
my proposal e-mailed to you on 10/22/01.  We are in the process of
considering several term transactions that could be supported by the VNG
assets.  Given your previous interest in terminating the Gas Supply
Assignment and Agency Agreement early I wanted to ask if you still have
that interest.  If we complete any of the transactions being considered
it will become more difficult to cleanly terminate the Agreement and
return the assets to you without you taking on the obligations within
such agreement.  It sounded to me last week as if you were no longer
focused on the early termination for the reasons that you outlined.  We
understood your request to look at this opportunity and we responded
with our 10/22/01 proposal.  Can you tell me if your interest has
changed ?  I want to remain focused on this if you are interest, if
things have changed I want to move on in another direction.

Frank

"Computer Virus","
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

Re:  Automotive Industrial Energy Company, L.L.C.

I am responsible for this entity, but it doesn't fall under Alan's bailiwick.  It is instead in Carlos Sol? and Jeff Hodge's area (EWS Legal). 

Anyhow, this LLC was formed to co-own an SRL in Mexico that was not created because the deal in quesiton--to provide energy to automobile producers in Mexico--was put on hold.  I told somebody in your office about my desire to hold off on the LLC agreement because of this situation, and was told it was OK to do so for a little while.  We'll try to ascertain the current needs of the business group to see if this LLC should be maintained or dissolved, and I'll keep you advised.

Notice ID: 3144
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Due to long-wall mining activity occurring under Columbia's Line SM-123 in
Mingo County, WV, the line will be taken out of service.  Columbia anticipates
this outage to begin in late October 2001 and run through approximately
mid-November 2001.  However, the start date and duration of the outage is
contingent upon the actual timing and progress of the long-wall mining
activity.  Given the level of firm commitments in this area, Columbia believes
that there will be no available capacity for interruptible transportation.  The
following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"Onondage Gas Sales Agreement","Ed, Eric,

I have confirmed with Jeff Hodge regarding the termination of this contract.  At this time, the contract is effectively terminated as Bankruptcy causes a triggering event to terminate, although no notice has been received by ENA from the Counterparty with respect to a termination payment.  After talking to Jeff, he explained (as stated in the contract) that the Affected Party shall pay the Termination Payment to the Notifying Party.  Since ENA is the Affected Party, no payment would need to be made, as the contract is in the money to ENA.  

**With respect to ENA sending a Termination Payment Notice to the Counterparty, please ensure no notice is generated to affect the timing/value of the potential asset sale of which Fred Mitro is involved.

Thank you,
Russell.

"Are you hanging in there?","Jeff:

I realize that there is nothing anyone can say right now that can improve the situation, but I can only imagine what you have been through the past few weeks as the Company virtually went into a financial free fall.  While I think the Dynegy deal was the only real alternative that we had to work with under the exigent circumstances at hand, I can imagine how painful this whole thing must be for you in light of your longevity with the Company and everything you have built there from a professional standpoint.  It almost has seemed surreal each day watching the Company's financial condition deteriorate so suddenly; as I watched everyday's new developments, I kept reflecting on the fact that it was only a bit more than a month ago that you and I were speaking with one another at the EWS Legal Conference with virtually no hint of what was to come.  Although we have not worked directly together much over the past few years, I feel like I know you pretty well ""through"" all of the many EWS lawyers that I work with and frequently ""bumping"" into you in the hallways ""on 38"".  It always has been fairly apparent to me how much effort, thought and sweat equity you have put into EWS and the EWS legal group and I have always considered you one of the pillars of the EWS legal group.  From my standpoint as well, in light of the extensive working relationship I have been fortunate to have with Enron and many of its lawyers over the past 6-7 years, it has been very hard to witness the Company's difficulties and the relentless barrage of negative news and publicity everyday in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, particularly since I know that virtually everyone I have worked with at the Company is of the highest caliber, character and integrity.   To see the Company tarnished has been vry tough to watch.  Although it may be hard to see it right now, let's hope that some good comes out of this incredibly difficult situation and that the integration with Dynegy goes well.  I would think that your skill set would be valued highly by Dynegy, particularly in light of its heavy focus on gas and power trading.  Hang in there, Jeff.  Perhaps the next time I am in town, we could catch up for lunch again.

Best regards.

John

"Rio Bravo Pipeline Confidentiality Agreement","I talked with Kevin Levy about the changes that Enron North America Corp. requested for the confidentiality agreement.  

He agreed to all the changes that were on ENA's draft, with one exception, ENA's proposed two year term of the agreement.  Since the pipeline will not be built for several years, ENA has agreed to stay with a three year term for the agreement.  

Please make the necessary changes and e-mail the revised confidentiality agreement to me.  I will get the necessary ENA approvals and signatures on Monday and hopefully can fax to your office the signed agreement.  Please let me know what fax number to use?

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  I will be back in the office on Monday.

Thanks for the quick turn-around on the agreement,

"Your Role in Computer Virus Protection","As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

"RE: Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts","This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the issue of Transportation Contract rejection with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews and Kurth.  He and his partner Jeff Spiers have been advising other Enron divisions regarding the contract rejection process.  

I am told that a motion has been filed with the bankruptcy court requesting that shorthand procedures be established for the purpose of allowing the various Enron Debtors to reject executory contracts.  That motion is apparently slated to be heard on January 7.  The attached template describes the information that must be filed with the court and forwarded to the creditors' committee and to the relevant counterparty whose contract is being rejected.  Assuming that the order is approved, we'll be able to start rejecting transportation contracts as early as January 8.  

Kelli and Maria,

In order to expedite the process, could you please fill out the attached template, providing the information requested. 

Please call with any questions.

Thanks for your help.

Attached is an e:mail that I forwarded to Jeff Speirs, a bankruptcy attorney with Andrews and Kurth who will be assisting with the mechanics of rejecting the out of the money transportation agreements that you all have identified.  I imagine that we will need full company names, contact persons and addresses in order to place the different pipes on notice of the motion to reject.  Could you please coordinate the gathering of this information so that we will be in a position to act on it as soon as possible after New Years?  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts

Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Hi Ellen

It was great to meet you yesterday. It was a most enjoyable night!

As promised, here is my resume. I'd be most grateful for any leads you
may have.

As a brief recap on yesterday's conversation, I am trained as a
solicitor in the UK and moved over here 18 months ago. I am currently
working at Compaq, but am very interested in looking at other
opportunities outside of the company. My current role is as a Contract
Manager within the supply chain organization. I  support several
business units and deal with a variety of legal issues, including
Procurement Contracts, Licensing Agreements and  NDA's.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best Regards

Emma Caplan

"Enron MW/Peoples Master","As everyone is aware, Peoples provided notification to Enron MW, L.L.C. of its desire for credit support or termination effective December 28th of the Master Physical Agreement between EMW and PGL.  Richard and I met with Raulie, Dave and Tim this morning to discuss the implications of the termination and our ability to continue to fulfill our obligations regarding the deals that are subject to the Master.  After much discussion, they (PGL) have agreed to delay any termination until either the end of January or February (they are going to discuss internally which makes more sense).  Therefore, unless a higher power overturns our agreement, PGL intends to issue a letter amending their previous notification/assurance letter.  If anyone has any questions or comments, please let Richard or me know at your earliest convenience.

"Master Gas Agreement","Jeff, this Agreement should replace the GISB and any other gas agreement
between the parties.  The collateral language is incorporated into the
document.  Also, with respect to the Collateral Agreement for Duke Energy
Merchants LLC (""DEM""), Duke would like to propose assigning all of the
Enron transactions with DEM into one Enron entity and then using the form
of collateral agreement submitted to ENA (with some tweaking to allow for a
Guaranty from Duke Capital Corporation) to cover the transactions between
the Enron counterparty and DEM.  Duke can present a list of companies which
it has outstanding transactions with if Enron would like.  Please let me
know if you have any questions in this regard.  Thanks - Joe

"Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call","Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

In addition, I requested that Sequent provide ENA with an offer to serve the Hopwell transaction ( did not tell VNG that it was Hopewell, just described the general service).  Dana Grams told me last week that they were concerned about entering into an agreement to get back their assets, because they felt we may file bancruptcy at which point they would get the assets back for ""free"".  This is a lame excuse and I generally told him so.  I told him that we were not going to give back the assets and if he wanted them back we needed to get the same or better value to terminate our deal early.  He said they would revisit the arrangement and let me know.  I will keep you posted.

                                OCTOBER 18, 2001

Notice ID: 3193
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the
specified dates.

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

Subject:	Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts

Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

"RE: Asset Management and Supply Agreements, Virginia Natural Gas","Dana, thank you for the offer. I will review your proposal and respond quickly.  As you implied in your offer, it is important that we complete this transaction very quickly if we are going to do it.  My initial thoughts are that we would need to receive the payments over a maximum of 12 months not 24 months.  In addition, as we are using the assets to manage an unrelated delivery obligation I will need to either determine another way to manage that delivery without the VNG assets or transfer the short position to you.  I do believe that given the details of this delivery obligation you will see it as a positive value to you.
I will provide an official response asap. I suggest that we consider a time on Wed or Thur of this week to get together for discussion.

Subject:	Virginia Natural Gas Payment for $7,264,089.42 Due 11/26/01
Importance:	High

Per our conversations with Tony Walden at VNG, Tony has been instructed not to release any funds to Enron per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL.  AGL is the parent of VNG.  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, but if you need any more information from Settlements, please contact Margaret Dhont, at 713-853-7683.  

Here's the blow by blow:

Tuesday a.m.
Tony Walden (VNG) told Kay Khan (settlements coordinator for ENA) that he had the payment set up in their system to pay ENA $7,264,089.42, but that per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL no payments were to be released to Enron.

Around 11:30 - Bryce Baxter contacted Beth White to find out what the issues were that would prevent payment.  Left message.

Tuesday p.m.
Around 3:00 - Bryce Baxter called Beth White again and spoke with her secretary.  Her secretary said she would send Beth a text page and would call back as soon as possible, but haven't received return call yet.

Around 4:30 - Bryce Baxter called Beth again and left another message.  Kay Khan also called Tony Walden again and left another message, letting him know we hadn't received a call back from Beth White.

David Jones has also called a couple of his Commercial counterparts at VNG/AGL today, but was not able to get a response.  I tried to talk to David tonight so I could give you specific names, but was unable to reach him.

Hi All--

Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Line / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding.

Transco is saying they won't implement ""prior to April 1"" but haven't decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement.  Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes.

On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more ""Transco-like"" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.  Will keep you posted.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

=============================================================================================================
TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES

Capping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval from FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply with orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practices and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 587.

According to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Line complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP01-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco's proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.

The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

On order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenue sharing.
FERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the claim that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours.

FERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tiered cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified ""why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days,"" said the
commission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that ""Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue."" But the commission went on to say that it ""may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading"" to avoid certain charges.

Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances. FERC said that ""it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded.""

=============================================================================================================
FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/low daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed during and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co. to ""remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system,"" FERC said.

To stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing
plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the applicable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commission noted that Texas Gas ""has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided.""

However, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language, the order explained that daily high/low index prices ""may unduly increase penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637.""

The order went on to say that ""a less draconian measure"" may be appropriate. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism ""that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price"" if it wanted to provide ""an incentive for shippers to remain in balance,"" FERC said.

Subject:	SOUTHERN NATURAL FILES $245 MILLION PROPOSAL TO BOOST CAPACITY

From Inside FERC (Oct. 8th)--pls let me know if you want more detail or would like to see the FERC filing.  Will keep you posted as the project progresses through FERC.

Suzanne
============================================================================================================
SOUTHERN NATURAL FILES $245 MILLION PROPOSAL TO BOOST CAPACITY
To serve local distributors, industrial users and power generators, Southern Natural Gas Co. filed with FERC last week to build $245 million worth of compression, pipeline looping and other facilities to transport a total of 359,891 Mcf/day. The project would be constructed in two phases.

The expansion would start moving 320,714 Mcf/day by June 1, 2003, said the Oct. 1 application (CP02-1 et. al.). In the project's second phase, Southern Natural would install additional facilities to move 39,177 Mcf/day by May 1, 2004. Phase one includes 114.5 miles of looping in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, which would be built in 11 segments that range in length from 3.41 miles to 16.74 miles. Pipe diameters would range from 24 inches to 36 inches. Phase two includes 8.8 miles of 30-inch-diameter looping in Georgia that would be
constructed in two segments of 4.8 miles and 4.0 miles.

Southern Natural proposed installing a total of 76,930 horsepower of compression, of which 11,280 hp would replace existing compression facilities that have deteriorated or otherwise become obsolete. Phase one includes ten compression units ranging in size from 3,550 hp to 15,000 hp. Under phase two, one 4,730 hp unit would be installed. Furthermore, Southern Natural proposed abandoning six compressors that generate a total of 9,930 hp.

All 359,891 Mcf/day of the capacity has been subscribed, the application said. During an open season held between Dec. 15 and Jan. 26, firm service agreements were reached with Southern Co. Services Inc., 97,950 Mcf/day, Calpine Energy Services LP, 95,000 Mcf/day, SCANA Resources Inc., 93,046 Mcf/day, Effingham County Power LLC, 58,766 Mcf/day, the City of Austell, Ga., 6,366 Mcf/day, Morgan Stanley, 5,400 Mcf/day, Proctor & Gamble, 1,763, and Kimberly-Clark, 1,600 Mcf/day.

Southern Natural asked FERC to allow it to roll in the cost of the expansion in its next rate proceeding ""based on the considerable benefit to the overall rates of existing customers."" Revenues generated from the new contracts are expected to exceed project costs by approximately $154 million, thus the expansion would result in ""a significant benefit"" to current shippers, Southern Natural said. In addition to the financial benefits, existing shippers will enjoy operational benefits as well, said the pipeline. ""The combination of additional compression and new loop pipeline represents a significant enhancement to system reliability for all shippers delivering gas"" in Southern Natural's market area, the
application said. Furthermore, Southern Natural promised that service to existing shippers would not be degraded as a result of the project.

Subject:	Clean Sweep today

Gas Structuring is starting its ""Clean Sweep"" process today at 3:00 PM on the 32nd floor.  Clean Sweep is the process that the move coordinators have instituted to eliminate unnecessary storage of outdated material in the new building.  So, Gas Structuring will close for business effective 3:00 PM today and reopen tomorrow morning.  If you or anyone on your team have an urgent matter that has to be addressed today, please make every effort to get to us in time for us to respond before 3:00 PM.  Also, please forward this notice to the persons on your respective teams.  If you have any questions, please ask.  
Thanks,
Ed

PS  The move ""regulators"" are reported to be providing refreshments and snacks for this event.  As such, we are seeking proposals to ""pass through"" these ""incentives"" to any person or persons who would like to ""outsource"" our sweep process.  Proposals will be accepted up until 12:00 PM today.  We reserve to right to accept all or any part of  any proposal and may or may not negotiate with one or more parties to provide the sweep service.  All sweep outsourcing proposals are subject to move regulator approval.  Any change in move regulation that results in a reduction in incentives being enjoyed by Gas Structuring will require that the outsourcing party keep Gas Structuring whole.  Baseball arbitration for all disputes.  This agreement will be governed by Texas Law and we will give the successful outsourcing party(ies) our contract to sign immediately prior to work commencing.  No changes to the contract will be allowed since the move regulators have already approved the agreement.  We will answer no questions regarding the size or number of files to be swept.  You must obtain any information regarding the size or number of files, type or quantity or refreshments, type and quantity of snacks and other such data from public sources.  We will accept cash above all other forms of consideration.

Kelly,
I received a Revision in Estimates of Monthly Metered Supplies from CNR for JML Oil & Gas for the month of October.  The original estimate was 109,718 Dth on Contract 12, Sitata #283294 (per the CNR Oct01 Estimates supplied by Terry Franklin).  This volume should be reduced to 69,551 per the revision faxed to me by Cath Clark. 
However, I would make the change effective  next Tuesday for the balance of the month with cash price stron for the weekend.
Please call if you have questions.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Additional Quote for ""prospective"" customer behind COH 5-2","Dear John,
Good Morning.  Thanks again for the winter quote last night, your quote was very competitve with the others I have received.  I am hoping that customer will make a decision by Thursday.  I have another favor to ask of you, I have attached a ""prosepctive"" customers load profile below for you to review.  This customer is also behind 5-2 and is looking for a NYMEX plus applicable basis quote for 1 year out of Nov 01.  They also need firm delivery to this gate.  I know we spoke yesterday about the issue that you may not be able to quote the summer.  Please let me know if this issue has been resolved.  If not, please sumbit winter only and I will see what I can do.  I appreciate your help in advance and I look forward to bringing more business your way.

Subject: TE Capacity for length restricted


November 7, 2001

Extended weather forecasts portend low demand conditions for the next
week to ten days.  Currently, Texas Eastern Transmission (TE) is facing
high line pack levels and full storage.  Thus the pipe has severely
restricted ability to absorb due-shipper gas.  Effective immediately, TE
is requesting that all shippers ensure that physical receipts do not
exceed physical deliveries. Receipt operators are expected to not flow
above scheduled volumes.  Delivery meters are expected to take all gas
scheduled.  Any customer who is long should take immediate action to
resolve due-shipper positions.

No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled, and OBA parties should
ensure that physical takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper
makeup gas may be scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.
These restrictions are expected to be in effect until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

Importance:	High

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Hello,
I need to lock in TCO pool supply for my customer starting April 02 through July 04. Yes, this term is correct and they in fact want to lock this in soon (at the latest Tuesday morning). I have attached their load profile below. They are looking for a Nymex plus applicable basis quote. BUT, they want seasonal pricing (i.e. a winter quote and a separate summer quote). In other words they want to see 5 different prices (Apr02-Oct02, Nov02-Mar03, Apr03-Oct03, Nov03-Mar04, and Apr04-Jul04). I hope this makes sense and if you have any questions please call me at 502-214-6364 or send me an e-mail. Thanks for your help in advance.
















Sincerely,
Aiysha Billings

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

	Obviously, we would be willing to enter into a Master Agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron.  At this point in time we would not be willing to enter into a GISB as we would prefer working under the GTCs until the Master is hammered out.  

	If you can get credit to get us the appropriate information, we can prepare the master.

In negotiating the cross-affiliate master netting agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron, they have inquired as to our willingness to enter into a Master Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement for US and Canada gas trading, respectively. Currently, we are trading under GTCs (online and offline). In the interim, they have also asked if we would willing to enter into a GISB to replace working under the GTCs.

I'm not really sure why we haven't gotten a master agreement in place with J Aron in the past other than neither party was focusing on the necessity of doing so. Your recollections/thoughts going forward?

"Re: Colonial Outstanding AR","Again, I apologize for the lengthy note but this should serve as good backup for resolution of the original recall problems with Colonial.

First, I am treating Dec-00 as if it is truly a buy / sell situation though I believe that the intention was to recall ENA sales.  The below schedule of buy deals have not been paid (i.e. Colonial never actually billed ENA).  Therefore, I can use the payment due on these payables to clear the existing A/R balance.  The remaining $531.09 is inconsequential.



Second, Colonial gave me erroneous information for Mar-01 recall items.  They originally listed various sale items that were EOL deals, thus indisputable.  We have finally come to agreement that all recalls for Mar-01 should have been booked under ENA sale deal #336733, days 8, 22, and 24-26, a total of 22,500 MMBtu recalled.  Upon research of this new information it has been determined that the entire 22,500 is booked as buy / sell, as expected.  However the purchase side shows that 18,000 MMBtu of these items actually had an ENA purchase price of $0.00000 and 4,500 MMBtu at $5.54000, which was never billed to ENA but was paid.

Therefore, it seems obvious to me that in light of no price or non-billing of these purchases, the real intent was a true recall of our sales with no affect to the purchase side at all.  Furthermore, both the sales and purchase sides of the 22,500 MMBtu for Mar-01 has been ""zeroed"" out, creating a total credit due to Colonial of $103,050.  Please let me know if there are any objections to this.  If so, I will need support from Cindy / Dick for the purchases booked for Mar-01 prod. and their ""0"" prices.  See the below schedule for Mar-01 items that have been zeroed out.



Thank you,

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

John - Apologies for the long note below but I believe it will be useful to get into the detail to resolve our Colonial recall issues.

Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.

Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.

Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.

Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.

Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.

Thank you - Scott Dozier

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas may be
scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.  These restrictions
are expected to be in effect through Sunday, October 14, 2001.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any

Jeff, 

I will be meeting with the Texas land office on Thursday morning and would like to send them the attached tomorrow for their review prior to the meeting.  The attached is a Letter of Understanding (drafted by me based on your prior letter of understanding).  It is specific to the Kathleen Ann storage field and includes the current owner of the field as a third party to the letter. 

If at all possible, I would like you (or your designee) to review, modify and resend to me so that I can send it to the land office tomorrow.

Thanks,
Brian.

*************************************************************************************************************************************************

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

Subject:	System Imbalance Notice

October 24, 2001 

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive 
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of 
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective 
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional 
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent 
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to 
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further 
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its 
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently 
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers 
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to 
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits 
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may 
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies 
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

Subject:	enovate/EMW bank accounts

As part of our ongoing discussions regarding the viability of enovate/EMW, we need to further address the bank account and funds flow situation.  Here are the facts to the best of my knowledge:

1 - enovate has a separate Citibank bank account that should be able to send and receive payments.  There have been some bumps along the way, but I think they may be resolved.
2 - Pre-petition, EMW shared the same bank accounts as ENA.  Money that came into the account was allocated back to the appropriate entity by accounting.
3 - Post-petition, EMW shares the same bank accounts as several other non-bankrupt Enron companies.  
4 - However, Accounting and Treasury have told me that we cannot use the new account because funds are not flowing out of the account and that if any money comes into the account it may not be released or credited to the appropriate entity.  

In order to preserve the viability of enovate/EMW and fulfill our obligations, we would prefer to be able to move funds through EMW.   Attached is a quick example of a transaction that would normally flow through EMW.  

Ed - we can talk more about this at 11:00 

Thanks - Gregg

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Subject: Because the Hokey Pokey is more interesting than what we do for a living

I had to do some follow-up research on the background to the earlier e-mail (which is still the high point of my day):


http://www.goodbyemag.com/apr/hokey.htm


Hokey Pokey Dance Founder Dies. The Mystery Lives On.
Larry LaPrise put his right foot, as well as the rest of himself, in the grave April 4, age 83. Those who remember the exquisite torture that is the Hokey Pokey will find bittersweet news of its inventor's death. While most may remember the dance as a staple of grade-school music class, La Prise actually invented it for the ""apr?s-ski"" crowd at an Idaho resort in the 40s. The scandalous part of the story is that he almost certainly stole it. But from whom?
The song was recorded as a novelty a couple of times but it didn't become a source of steady income for LaPrise until Roy Acuff bought the rights to it in the 60s.
Alas, the Hokey Pokey turned out to be the high-water mark of LaPrise's musical career-in fact, the only water mark. LaPrise, by then a father of six, was working for the post office in Ketchum, Idaho.
There followed a steady succession of recordings: Jack Johnson and the Hickory Dickory Singers, Warren Covington with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Cliffie Stone, Jerry Marks, Chubby Checker, Annette Funicello, the Champs. In no time, the Hokey Pokey was everywhere. Other versions include, ""Hokey Pokey Cow Bell Blues,"" ""Hokey Pokey Mama,"" and ""Hokey Pokey Polka.""
By the early 1990s, it had even turned up on a heavy metal album by the band Haunted Garage, alongside such classics as ""Party in the Graveyard"" and ""Torture Dungeon"".
""The Hokey Pokey' is like a square dance, really,'' LaPrise said in 1992. ""You turn around. You shake it all about. Everyone is in a circle, and it gets them all involved.''
The tune became the official victory dance for the Iowa State Football team. ''''I guarantee you we never had a big victory where we were the underdog or won a championship game or had a bowl victory that we didn't do the Hokey Pokey and celebrate,'' Coach Hayden Fry said. I would have sent him a note. I'm sure he never dreamed that he made a contribution in athletics.'''
But the really shocking part is that the song may have been stolen.
Lexington, KY resident Bob Degen claims the folk song is his.
Degen, 90, owns a 1944 copyright for ""The Hokey-Pokey Dance,"" and claims to have written the words and music. His copyright predates LaPrise's by six years.
""He's a faker,"" Degen said of LaPrise. In fact, Degen sued LaPrise in 1956 in U.S. District Court in California. According to Degen, the two parties settled out of court to split 40 percent of the royalties. Degen is adamant that he wrote the song without any influences. The truth, unusually, seems to lie not in between but without: Pure Invention is rare.
A December 1945 issue of Dance magazine contains an article about an English novelty song called ""the Okey Cokey,"" which American GIs were said to have danced to in England during WWII.
You put your left arm in. 
You put your left arm out, 
And shake it all about. 
You do the okey-cokey 
And you turn about. 
And that's what it's all about."" 
In his 1940 book, The Gift to be Simple, Edward Deming Andrews described a song called ""The Hinkum-Booby"" that was sung by Shakers in Kentucky:
""I put my right hand in,
I put my right hand out, 
I give my right hand a shake, 
And I turn it all about."" 
So everybody in the copyright dispute was stealing from the great well of traditional folksong. As are all who try to be original with materials we hope will find resonance.

"Law Library","Hi Jeff!

I didn't know where else to direct my question, so you are the lucky one!  Periodically, I receive books/updates from West Publishing (Westlaw people) for our law library.  Previously, I was giving these to Keegan.  With Keegan and Barbara no longer here, I am not sure what to do about these books and updates.  Help!

Signed,
Glad to Still Be Here

"Confirmation","Here is a confirmation that I have played around with and added some appropriate wordng like I would add if I were doing a deal that involved 10 percent or 20 percent swing, differernt  pricing, etc.  

I don't think I have ever had a deal where we had different pricing involving the swing language, so I made one up for you.  Let me know if this helps.

"Draft of revised definition of Material Adverse Change/Credit Rating Trigger","Pursuant to our discussion yesterday regarding the above, please find below for your consideration a suggested revision to MAC/Credit Rating trigger definition to used in all future master trading agreements or confirmations in which Enron Corp's credit rating is part of a MAC/Credit Rating trigger.

""Material Adverse Change"" means (i) with respect to [Enron Trading Entity], Enron Corp. (or its successor or its successor's parent company) shall have long-term, senior, unsecured debt not supported by third party credit enhancement that is rated by S&P below ""BBB-"" [also insert Moody's as appropriate];

I understood yesterday that we may also need to consider changing the definition of Credit Support Provider in the ISDA's. I suspect that if ""Credit Support Provider"" is defined as Enron Corp. in the relevant Master, then the corresponding changes noted above would also need to be made. Your further thoughts regarding this issue are welcomed.

Please provide me your comments to the above language by tomorrow so we can start implementing a revised definition in our agreement templates.

Regards, Alan

"Membership rewards announcement - Pls distribute 1/18/02","AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

"Deal 139693","Kam/Alejandra,  This deal should probably be zero effective Nov 2001.  I believe it's a dupe to 139683 on CGAS..Volumes now are zero on 139693.  It's a sale to Hopewell that was created in December 1999 but it has a hedge N59964 and a demand charge attached to it that should be taken out.  THANKS

I have scheduled the Health Center to come and administer flu shots to our floor on Wednesday.  I need to have an approximate number of how many vaccines we will need.  Please ask within your groups today and see who will be interested and let me know.

Subject:	Project Notre Dame - Change in Control

The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.  Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.  Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?  Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.  Thanks.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

November 8, 2001


To: S-2 Customers

Re: TETCO Phase II/PCB Filing 12/01/01

On October 31, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP88-67 to 
reflect an estimate of TETCO's Year 12 PCB related costs.  
Included in the filing were revised rates under TETCO's Rate 
Schedule X-28 which Transco utilizes to render service under its 
Rate Schedule S-2.  The revised rates have a proposed effective 
date of December 1, 2001, and if accepted as proposed would 
result in the following changes in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 
rates: 

Demand Rate 			- $0.0100 increase
Demand Charge Adjustment - $0.0008 increase

Please refer any questions to Mike Heeney, Rate Department, at

"Re: COLFFL Payout Schedule","The rumors of my demise have been greatly exagerated!  Congrats to Maxfield as we knew all along which conference was the stronger.  I will net out all
""outstanding"" debts against Eric's schedule.  However, I refuse to pay out any winnings until all accounts have been settled.  I will not get stuck
holding the empty bag; I understand now why Eric didn't want to have anything to do with the money.  I trust everyone can read this e-mail and deduce
how much you owe me.  I will give the ""outstanding"" franchises until Jan. 4th to contact me and arrange payment terms without being disgraced by having
their names mentioned as being ""outstanding"" at this point of the season.  I would prefer to not mention any names, GRASS, unless I have to!

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"Re: Colonial Outstanding AR","John - Apologies for the long note below but I believe it will be useful to get into the detail to resolve our Colonial recall issues.

Below is some detail on Colonial discrepancies involved with recallable deals in Dec-00 and Mar-01.  Please advise as to what the next course of action should be to clear this up.  I would be happy to meet with any one involved to clarify any issues or questions.

Overview:  I am still unclear as to what recallable means.  It sounds from your note below and everything that Cindy has told me, that by recall you simply mean a buy back or back-to-back as it resides within our system.  However, Colonial is not billing or settling it that way.  They are wanting to collect on their sale for these items while considering our sales for these as never having flowed.  Unless, I am missing something from your conversations with Colonial their may be a disconnect with them.

Note, the first section attached is fairly straight forward.   All recall sales being disputed by Colonial involve direct back-to-back sales with Colonial.  As for deal #658124, I see no problems between Sitara and Unify; Colonial is questioning only 4,500 on day 8 and no other gas on deal 336733.  In fact, Unify will not allow an imbalance on all back-to-back or brokered deals.

Section two shows the items that Colonial has claimed as recalled in Dec-00.  They have yet to give me days so I can not break out the items from our market to our sales to Colonial.  But, they all involve back-to-backs.

Section three shows other TETC items in dispute.  I listed these simply because I consider it possible that these may be involved in the recall items in question.

Thank you - Scott Dozier

Subject:	Re: Colonial Outstanding AR   

According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.

"VNG transportation capacity","John,
I have reviewed the contracts (Asset Agreement and the GPA) and here are my thoughts regarding your request.  In short, the agreements do not specifically address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take releases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he was going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. now), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load growth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considering the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heavily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done recallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.

My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the deliverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talking to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequent is VNG's asset manager.  

Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as well.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

I understand your group is handling all GSA's, and will be dealing with this contract. Can you let Fred Mitro and Ben Jacoby know which commerical person in your group they should contact about this GSA?

"VERY IMPORTANT ENRONONLINE  STACK MANAGER CHANGES","
We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of ""zeros"" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

"Enron Announcement","Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

"Attention Body Shop Members -- UPDATE on Body Shop Closure","The decision to close the Body Shop came after the December 15 payroll run, so you will incur a deduction on your December 15 paycheck.  However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck.  

As a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers.

"1-URGENT - Outlook Email Notification (new)","OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 17th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

"KeySpan agreements","Hi Jeff,

I was cleaning off the desk of one of my coworkers who was laid off and found two letters from KeySpan that she had not handled.  They were both from Charles Daverio, KeySpan Utility Services LLC as agent for The Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  One letter is a termination of a master agreement between ENA and The Brooklyn Union Gas Company, dated 12/01/88, with the termination effective 10/31/04.  The other is an alternative contract quantity election effective 11/01/01 for a master agreement dated 12/08/88.  I cannot locate either of these agreements in our system.  KeySpan Utility Services LLC, as agent or otherwise, is not set up in the Global Counterparty system at all.  None of our Brooklyn Union agreements even come close in date to the ones referenced in these letters.

In light of our current situation, I wanted to check with you to see if you knew anything about either agreement being referenced.  I certainly do not wish to call the counterparty and it probably does not even matter at this point.  I do plan to send these documents to the file room, but without a contract number to file them under, the file room will not know what to do with the documentation.

Please advise.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Don,
Attached are both contracts vps1 and vps2. Each contract comprises of three sub contracts , the CTA, The GSA, and the supplemental netting agreement. The best person to speak to on the commercial side is Tim Marsters  who maintains the Enron / TXU relationship and has negotiated all changes to the contracts. His contact numbers are 011442077783415 and his cellphone no is 011447711816960. I have told him that you may call him. I am also available if you have any questions.

"Appalachian Supply to Wellhead Bood","1.  John Hodge has agreed to pay Index plus1/4 cent for the metered production to ENA Upstream.  I will prepare a spreadsheet monthly to calculate the origination.  John did mention that there is baggage associated with the metered production, such as calls with MarkWest and EES.  If we really want to trade the metered production (i.e. asking for I + 4 cents), he wants to transfer the baggage to us.  
2.  How will physical fixed prices be handled?  With whom do I deal with?  Currently, when I fix prices for metered production, John Hodge takes the risk into his book.  
3.  I have sent the Wellhead GTC contracts to Rudwell Johnson in Credit.  If he OKs, we can send new contracts to the producers.  Who is to prepare and mail the new contracts?
4.  Once new contracts are in place, Terry Franklin can create new deals in Sitara.
5.  There was discussion when Grass was still here that the metered production from EES would be moved into the ENA Upstream book.  I was talking to Barry Vanderhorst w/EES last night. I believe that this is a distinct possibility.   I told Barry to contact Fred Lagrasta about this option. There are two people in the Dublin, Ohio office that handle the EES gas, Jim Javins and Heidi Griffith.

Subject: RE:



JULIA,

I HAVE ADDED THE BELOW COMMENTS IN CAPS. THESE ARE FROM AN INTERNATIONAL POINT OF VIEW ONLY. AS DISCUSSED, PAUL HANKS IS YOUR BEST BET FOR DOMESTIC (IE WITHIN CANADA/USA).  

Thanks so much for all of your help.  The following is a recap of the questions asked. 

 1. Describe the types of transportation used by ENA/Enron to transport raw materials and finished product. 
2.  Identify states through which ENA/Enron  transports raw materials and finished product. 

3. Describe the goods,  materials, or product used inthe ordinary course of business, if any, that are imported from outside of the US.  Approximately what percentage of the total goods, materials, and products in the ordinary course of business are imported?

* THE ONLY IMPORT IS STEEL (SLABS, COILS, AND A VERY SMALL VOLUME OF PIPE WHICH WAS BEING FAZED OUT ANYWAY). IMPORTS WERE MUCH HEAVIER EARLIER IN THE YEAR BUT A STRATEGIC DECISION TO SEVERELY LIMIT IMPORTS WAS MADE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO DUE TO ANTI-DUMPING CASES INVOLVING MANY COUNTRIES. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON THE BOOKS SMALL VOLUMES OF IMPORTS OF COIL FROM MEXICO (RAIL) AND A FEW OCEAN IMPORTS FROM ASIA AND EASTERN EUROPE. TOTAL VOLUME OF OCEAN IMPORTS WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS EXPECTED SOON IS ONLY ABOUT 20,000 MT FOR SHIPMENT IN THE NEXT 2 MONTHS. I AM NOT CERTAIN OF THE MEXICAN VOLUME BUT I KNOW IT HAS DECLINED A LOT RECENTLY AND IS NOW QUITE SMALL (I WILL CHECK THIS). DEL'S GUESS OF A 2001 AVERAGE OF 40% STEEL IS PROBABLY RIGHT BUT THIS NUMBER WILL DECLINE DUE TO THE ABOVE MENTIONED STRATEGIC DIRECTION CHANGE.

WE ALSO DID A ""1 OF"" IMPORT OF 6,000 MT OF ORIENTED STRAND BOARD (PLYWOOD SUBSTITUTE) FROM IRELAND BUT THIS COMMODITY IS DUTY FREE AND WILL LIKELY NOT BE REPEATED.

NO PULP, RECYCLED OR NEWSPRINT IS IMPORTED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF STADACONA ORDERS FROM CANADA AND THAT VARIES WITH SOURCING CALCULATIONS EVERY MONTH. 

 

2  Describe the goods, materials, or products, if any, that are exported from the US.  Approximately what percentage of the total goods, materials, or products produced by the Debtors are exported?

RECYCLED - A LARGE PORTION OF TOTAL VOLUME IS EXPORTED TO ASIA. MY GUESS IS ABOUT 25-50% IS EXPORTED AND THIS IS GROWING.

LUMBER - NONE

STEEL - NONE

NEWSPRINT - VERY SMALL AMOUNT IS EXPORTED FROM STADACONA (ABOUT 10% OF PRODUCTION OR ABOUT 35,000 MT). WE HAVE A LONG POSITION IN MALAYSIA AS WE PURCHASED 5000 MT OF NP FROM A MILL THERE FOR SALE WITHIN ASIA. I BELIEVE 3000 MT IS STILL TO BE SOLD. NOTHING ELSE IS EXPORTED.

PULP - NO PULP EXPORTS FROM ENA FROM THE US. ENA DOES HAVE APPROX 26000MT OF INVENTORY IN EUROPE (BELGIUM, NETHERLANDS, GERMANY, ITALY). WE ALSO HAVE 4000 MT OF PULP INVENTORY IN INDONESIA. ALL THESE WAREHOUSES ARE ON RATE AGREEMENTS BUT NOT CONTRACTS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF STANDARDIZING AN ENRON CONTRACT TO TAKE TO THEM. ENA ALSO HAS INVENTORY IN NORTH AMERICA BOTH AT SHIPPING TERMINALS AND INLAND WAREHOUSES BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF THE VOLUMES (THIS IS DOMESTIC)

 

3. Do you employ any customs brokers? What serrvice do they perform on behalf of ENA/Enron? 

WE ONLY EMPLOY 2 CUSTOMS BROKERS AND THEY CALCULATE THE CUSTOMS DUTIES AND MISC CHARGES (VERY SMALL BUT ALSO COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS). THEY FILE THE IMPORT DOCUMENTS WITH CUSTOMS ON OUR BEHALF (THEY HAVE POA). I AM ALMOST CERTAIN THAT WE PAY DUTY TO CUSOMS DIRECTLY AS THE 2 BROKERS DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY ENRON FUNDS FOR FUTURE PAYMENTS. THEY RECEIVE A FLAT FEE PER ENTRY WHICH IS USUALLY VERY LOW SUCH AS $100-150/ENTRY.


4. Besides customs duties that are imposed on imported on imported and exported goods, material, and products are there any additional fees associated with the importation or exportation of goods?

NO FEES FOR EXPORTATIONS OR IF THERE ARE, THEY ARE NEGLIGIBLE (FREIGHT FORWARDER DOES THE 1 PAGE ENTRY ON THE INTERENT ON OUR BEHALF).

OTHER CHARGES THAT ARE PAYABLE ARE VERY SMALL COMPARED TO DUTIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES WHICH ENRON AVOID BY NOT DOING BUSINESS WITH COUNTRIES WHICH WOULD TRIGGER SUCH DUTIES TO BE IMPOSED. OTHER SMALL FEES WOULD BE ""HARBOR MAINTENANCE FEES"" WHICH IS A FRACTION OF 1 PERCENT OF CARGO VALUE SO VERY SMALL.

THERE MAY BE 1 OR 2 OTHER SMALL FEES IN ADDITION TO THE HMF BUT I DO NOT HAVE DETAILS ON THEM AND THEY ARE ALSO VERY SMALL.

 

5. What is the standard operating peocedure for payment of customs obligations? 

I BELEIVE WE PAY DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMS BUT I WILL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK. EITHER WAY, I AM CERTAIN THAT WE PAY CUSTOMS AS PER GENERAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES.
6. How often are customs duties and customs broker charges  paid?

THEY ARE PAID IN FULL FOR EACH SHIPMENT SHORTLY AFTER THE SHIPMENTS CROSS THE BORDER OR LEAVE BOND.


7. What is the average monthly accrued and unpaid customs duties?

I WILL HAVE TO CHECK INTO THIS AS I DON'T WANT TO MISLEAD YOU WITH A GUESS BUT IT IS QUITE LOW AND SOME OF THE COMMODITIES MAY BE DUTY FREE (MEXICO COILS AS PER NAFTA I BELIEVE).

STEEL IMPORT VOLUMES WILL LIKELY WIND DOWN TO NEAR ZERO SHORTLY.

  
8. Is there a letter of credit or surety bond posted to secure customs obligations?

 

THERE HAS NOT BEEN A BOND DONE DURING MY TENURE AT ENRON SO FAR AND I DOUBT ANY SUCH SECURITY HAS EVER BEEN POSTED.
   
   In addition, please advise re warehouse and storage costs as well, i.e., costs, types of contracts, etc.   

FOR BALL PARK OF MONTHLY INTERNATIONAL FREIGHT COSTS BORN BY ENRON, IT DEPENDS IF CARGO IS SOLD CFR OR PURCHASED FAS/FOB (ENRON PAYS FREIGHT):

STEEL - TERMS WILL CHANGE DEPENDING ON ACCESS TO THE BEST TRANSPORT RATES SO WE MAY PAY ALL CHARGES 1 MONTH AND NONE THE NEXT OR SOMEWHERE INBETWEEN. FREIGHT CHARGES PAID BY ENRON MIGHT BE AROUND $100,000/MO.

LUMBER - NONE

PULP - SOME MONTHS WILL HAVE MANY SHIPMENTS AND SOME WILL HAVE NONE SO A HEAVY MONTH MIGHT BE $500,000 AND A LIGHT MONTH MIGHT BE ZERO.

NEWSPRINT -  WE ESSENTIALLY DON'T PAY ANY FREIGHT AS ALL NP IS BOUGHT DELIVERED. HOWEVER, STADACONA EXPORT TO THEIR EXISTING CUSTOMERS (COLOMBIA AND UK) WORKS OUT TO APPROX $250,000/MO IN FREIGHT.

RECYCLED - WE EXPORT APPROX 10000 MT/MO AND THE PLAN IS FOR ENRON TO CONTROL ALL FREIGHT SO THIS COULD WORK OUT TO $150,000-250,000/MO IN FREIGHT. 

 

Thanks again.   Julia 

PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL ON MY CELL IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO. I CAN GET A LOT MORE ANSWERS ON MONDAY BUT I REALIZE THIS MIGHT BE A BIT LATE.

"FW: December baseload sale to ENA","Jeff,

Per our conversation.  My request is to make this 100,000 reduction a reduction in ENA's obligation under the Gas Purchase and Agency Agreement by and between The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company (""Buyer"") and Enron North America Corp. (""Seller"").  I need it to specify that our obligation for the month will be not greater than original obligation minus 100,000 mmbtu/d.

Thanx,

Subject:	December baseload sale to ENA

Jim,

As per our conversation, Peoples would like to sell 100,000 MMBtu/d of
citygate gas to ENA on a baseload basis during the month of December.  The
price of this sale is NGI Bidweek Chicago Index-flat.  As we discussed, PGL
will still receive its $0.03/MMBtu credit on the full Baseload contract
volumes in the agreement, however PGL and ENA agree to offset physical
volumes.  Therefore, ENA will deliver 100,000 MMBtu less to PGL each day in
December, and that reduction in volume will come from ENA's Northern Border
deliveries.

Call me if you have any questions.

"RE: Fred Lagrasta","Yes, ENA Upstream Company LLC is the entity that deals with ENA's transactions with producers, similar to the way HPL (Houston Pipe Line Company) was dealing with producers.  

As for Fred Lagrasta, I've already created a document (copy attached) asking for Lagrasta to be named a V.P.  I don't know where it is in the signing cues of the relevant officers, but it may need to be changed since the directors have changed since I created the doc.  Have you by any chance seen this signed document?  I sent it to the 33rd floor to be signed, and I haven't had it returned.   

Please advise, and thanks,

"Enron Announcement","Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Jeff,

Thanks for helping with Midland contracts, but Credit has one more request. When possible, we would appreciate a Legal Review/Risk Memo on the existing MCV contracts to add to our file. The recent laboring on the new deal and contract has raised concerns about the contract, especially commercial terms, collateral rights, termination rights and the Consent Agreement. Also, it is my understanding that Sylvia would like to continuing working on the new contract and Master Collateral Agreement for future transactions, so I believe that a review of the proposed contract is beneficial as well. Thanks again for the help and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on the this issue.

-Darren

"New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

"VNG/Hopewell","John, I plan to speak with Sequent by the end of this week to inform them if we are interested in returning the assets to them and if so under what structure.  I have checked with Cris Sherman and others in Accounting, they have determined that the ""East Desk"" does not have to accelerate the payment of its ""debt"" to John Arnold's book if we get out of the Hopewell transaction. That being said, you were checking on the real $$$ exposure to retaining the Hopewell deal past the VNG transaction.  The way we are currently booked we are not interested in restructuring the VNG/Hopwell arrangement. If on the other hand we see real $$$ exposure, this is the perfect time to try to combine the VNG restructuring with the Hopwell exposure.  I need to understand our position this week if possible.

"RE: Nov 01 - TCo Metered Production Origination","John,
Truing-up estimbated production to actual production should no be a problem.
1.  In the case of Gatherco and CNR Gathering, the estimated volumes, by meter in for Gatherco, and by transport contract by CNR, have already been adjusted for OBA's when the nomination is made.
2. In the case of CGas, the estimate in our pool has not been adjusted for the OBA.  However, since the pool operator sells the estimate, the origination should be caluclated on the estimate.

Subject:	Nov 01 - TCo Metered Production Origination

Nelson & John,

Terry Franklin has prepared an Appalachian Estimated TCo Metered Production for Nov 01 schedule which she will provide you.  This represents our attempt at calculating the origination dollars (at TCo Index + 1/4 cent) attributable to the TCo Metered Production.

I'm not exactly sure how to create a transfer from John Hodge's book to the Wellhead book for these dollars ($14,981).

Terry will also provide the same format to capture DTI metered production origination.

John

"call for sign up - Diehards 3"," 
This is the official notice to sign up for our golf pool.  It is now in its 12th year, the 3rd using Yahoo. Rules are described below.
Necessary action: Let me know of your intention to participate by getting me your initial ante of $25 before January 2, 2002. Most of you have amount left over from last year that can be applied. We welcome new recruits, as long as they ante and have the commitment to participate all year long. 
The initial ante, which will serve as collateral, is due in the first week or any time the manager's collateral is more than $5.00 insufficient. After receipt of the collateral, the remainder of the year's accounting is by credit. The fee for entering each week is the greater of $5 or $2 per million of event prize money. Participation is mandatory except for three ""vacation"" weeks which require you to set all of your players as ""reserve"" or notify the members in advance of the deadline. 
The pool of entry fees will be distributed proportionally by each manager's credits for the week. Credits will come from three sources:  (1) Margin; (2) Rank among the managers for the week; and (3) Handicap.
For the weeks until Yahoo starts (probably with Pebble Beach) we will use a spreadsheet method as follows:  A list of eight golfers must be submitted to me by 8:00am (Central Time) on Thursday. Managers will get points by dividing their listed golfer's winnings by the sum of one plus the number of managers who have listed that golfer. 
For the above Margin component, a pool of credits (equal to 100 per participating manager) will be distributed proportionally by each manager's points in excess of half of the average points. 
For the above Rank component, a pool of credits of equal size to the margin pool will be distributed such that each position is 41.4% higher that the next lower. (For you actuaries, this is from the square root of two; the ratio doubles with every two steps up.) 
For the above Handicap component, the points are 0.0014 * (average team score) * ( $ in the hole at the start of the week  2 )?After Yahoo is up and running, the procedure will remain the same as last year. You will need to make your picks according to the Yahoo website and managers will get points according to the site's scoring.?For the above Margin component, each manager's margin will be their Yahoo points in excess of half of the average points. ?For the above Rank component, a pool of credits of equal size to the margin pool will be distributed such that each position is 41.4% higher that the next lower. (For you actuaries, this is from the square root of two; the ratio doubles with every two steps up.) ?For the above Handicap component, the points are 0.0014 * (average team score) * ( $ in the hole at the start of the week  2 )
Rules may be modified for weather delays, nonstandard tournament formats, or other special situations.

"Virginia Natural Gas Payment for $7,264,089.42 Due 11/26/01","Per our conversations with Tony Walden at VNG, Tony has been instructed not to release any funds to Enron per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL.  AGL is the parent of VNG.  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, but if you need any more information from Settlements, please contact Margaret Dhont, at 713-853-7683.  

Here's the blow by blow:

Tuesday a.m.
Tony Walden (VNG) told Kay Khan (settlements coordinator for ENA) that he had the payment set up in their system to pay ENA $7,264,089.42, but that per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL no payments were to be released to Enron.

Around 11:30 - Bryce Baxter contacted Beth White to find out what the issues were that would prevent payment.  Left message.

Tuesday p.m.
Around 3:00 - Bryce Baxter called Beth White again and spoke with her secretary.  Her secretary said she would send Beth a text page and would call back as soon as possible, but haven't received return call yet.

Around 4:30 - Bryce Baxter called Beth again and left another message.  Kay Khan also called Tony Walden again and left another message, letting him know we hadn't received a call back from Beth White.

David Jones has also called a couple of his Commercial counterparts at VNG/AGL today, but was not able to get a response.  I tried to talk to David tonight so I could give you specific names, but was unable to reach him.

Robin,

Attached is a draft of the agreed on deal. Our attorney set it up as an
amendment to the Fuel Management Agreement to save on definitions, etc.

(See attached file: #763766 v1.doc)

Our in-house folks are reviewing it, but I thought maybe you could look at
it in parallel to save time.

"FW: VNG transportation capacity","status?

Subject:	VNG transportation capacity

John,
I have reviewed the contracts (Asset Agreement and the GPA) and here are my thoughts regarding your request.  In short, the agreements do not specifically address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take releases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he was going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. now), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load growth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considering the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heavily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done recallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.

My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the deliverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talking to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequent is VNG's asset manager.  

Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as well.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

"Structure for Storage Loans / Deferred Payment Deals","
The memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown some interest.  

Essentially, this deal allows an LDC to defer payment for gas and avoid carrying costs (which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your customer's bottom line).  

We have done two of these deals to date.  ENA has interest in additional deals (albeit not an infinite appetite) if the structure allows us to move them off the balance sheet.

Please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an interest.  

Each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds group.  Gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them through to execution.  

Please call me with any questions at x36751

Subject:  FW: GPP Consent to Assignment 
Dan and/or Sandy - As I requested yesterday, we would like to get a copy of the actual assignment of the Gas Contract from Enron to HPL.  It has become even more important for us to receive that as our accounting group wants to know who it should be paying and, as you can understand, we need to assure ourselves that HPL was the actual contracting party and, therefore, is owed the money for gas purchased thereunder before we release the money to HPL.  Also, it will be important to see what date the assignment occurred and, if Enron and HPL want payments to occur that are different than the effective date of the assignment, we will need to receive proper authorizations from both parties indicating  different payment scheme.  Thus, if the assignment is effective on Dec. 1, we will pay Enron for all gas purchased thereunder through Nov. 30 unless instructed otherwise (and we will need both parties' concurrence on this)! .  Until we get proper authorization, our accounting people have been told to hold the money owed so we pay the proper party.  In this connection, it would be helpful to get this information as soon as possible.  If you have any questions regarding this, please call me at (972) 628-2750 or Doug Linenweber in accounting at (972) 628-2755.  Thank you.

In 1999 we (ENA through Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp.) entered into a 12-year prepay.  We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery obligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ, NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal.  

Currently the end users are Clark Public Utility District (Washington State), City of Glendale (California), City of Pasadena Water and Power Department (California), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California).

It is my understanding that ENGMC is not currently in bankruptcy.

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of the documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious to work out alternatives, if possible. 

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Thanks.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

"RE: Bridgeline","Jordan,
 
I spoke with George McKean earlier today who indicated that all assets of Enron were pledged and used as collateral for the dip. As explained to me, that would indicate our 40% equity interest would be pledged but not the underlying assets of Bridgeline. Can you confirm.

As far as I can discern from my limited due diligence, the Bridgeline interests have not been pledged or encumbered by Enron and it does not appear that they have been directly affected by the Bankruptcy.  Let me know if anything else needs to be rundown quickly.

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International

?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO

"Cross Bay Pipeline to New York City Gets FERC Nod","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Nov 7, 9:56 AM
Cross Bay Pipeline to New York City Gets FERC Nod 
FERC granted a final certificate to Cross Bay Pipeline Co. LLC of Houston to assume ownership of a 37-mile portion of Transcontinental Gas Pipeline's Lower New York Bay Extension and add 16,000 hp of compression in Middlesex County, NY, in order to boost gas deliveries into New York City by about 125,000 Dth/d. The Cross Bay project, first announced in January 1998, is estimated to cost $59.5 million. 
Once completed, the compressor station and pipeline would form a new interstate pipeline system that would extend from Middlesex County across the lower New York Bay, all the way to Nassau County, NY. The pipeline's capacity would be more than 600,000 Dth/d, with the additional 125,000 Dth/d of incremental capacity. 
""By expanding the capacity of these existing facilities, Cross Bay Pipeline Co. will be able to create an important gas transportation alternative for New Jersey and New York markets in an economical, efficient manner with minimal impact on the environment,"" project sponsors said in an earlier statement. 
Williams and Duke Energy each have a 37.5% ownership stake in the limited liability company, while KeySpan, which came on as a third partner in August 1998, owns 25% of Cross Bay (see Daily GPI, July 24, 2000 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20000724c.html>). 
Since its inception three years ago, the Cross Bay project has undergone some changes in size, cost and design. It originally was scheduled to go into operation in November 2000.

"calp","
	as you know back in march i restructured the commodity price for calp from tco pool gas daily avg + $0.05 to the higher gas daily posting of tco pool
	from either the day they actually consumed the gas or the gas daily posting two days in the future +$0.05.  as i recall at the time we talked about 
	granting origination but couldn't figure out how to do it given calp's peaking dispatch.  i asked jim willis to calculate the savings between the two postings
	only the future gas daily price posted higher than the price on the actual consumption day.  the total realized savings due to my restructuring is
	$38,500 for the april-august time period.  i am going to have jim calculate the sep savings.  i will forward the spreadsheet to  you.

	as you know calp wasn't dispatched much this summer and thus the actual saving isn't huge.  however, given their intraday call rights on 40MM/d of tco
	pool the potential savings was tremendous.

	additionally, calp is paying us an administrative monthly demand charge of $6,128.  during the course of the year i spent a considerable amount of time
	doing management duties as well per our agreement with them.  last year i spent 3 weeks alone creating and drafting the annual report required by the 
	bankers.  i have spent an considerable amount of time purchasing fuel oil during the winter as they burn it and also during the summer to refill the storage
	tanks.  the time i have spent on purchasing oil on their behalf wasn't just a quick phone call and you're done like it is in gas.  i spent a tremendous amount of 	time on	learning who the players are, on oil specs, scheduling, storage, pipeline allocations.  also when you buy oil you don't buy a defined volume.  you buy 
	a volume plus or minus 10%.  i had to keep tract of oil volumes and volume resolutions.  the list goes on and on.  
	
	guess what, i have started the process again.  if you feel that these contributions are not worthy of origination, then i need to know that.

	i'm going to be out tomorrow.  we can discuss on friday.

	thanks

	robin

Two new issues (Tanya- you are aware of the Ashland issue.):

1) WPS Energy Services-Jeff Malloy, Credit Manager of WPS, is upset with our pending margin call. He continues to cite the fact that he issues a $60 MM grty from WPS Resources, parent to Energy Services and the regulated Wisconsin Public Service. $60 MM is a far stretch for the value of the paper. As a recap of the WPS, I approached them about 2 months ago about renogiating the thresholds in the contract and executing an Enfolio. They said that they would look into it, but did not get back to me until all of the ""problems"" began to occur. Jeff and I spoke a few weeks ago we when he called for Adequate Assurances under a GISB that was assigned with CES purchased, but later terminated. I informed him that the contract was terminated and enlightened him to the fact that we were not currently margining him on the ISDA contract. He backed down. 

2) Ashland Incorporated,  Sherry Tackett would like to work on netting the physical and financial payments and decided to withhold the payment so we can resolve the problem. For October business, Ashland owes Enron approx $946,000 bewteen ENA and ENA Upstream. The financial positions continue through Dec '03 with a current value of ($604,314). She would like to unwind and receive payment on the financial positions before she pays physical. She says she will pay interest on the unpaid invoice while we work on the issue. I politely explianed to her that withholding payment is not the best means to an end, but that we will explore alternatives.

Darren,

I spoke with Sherry Tackett at Ashland.  Her phone number is 614-790-6941.  She said that they have financial positions out to 2001 with us.  She said that Enron owes Ashland 3.3 million and Enron owe's Ashland 827,000 on the financial positions.  On the phycical side, they own ENA Upstread 559,000+ and they owe ENA 387,000+.  She is trying to tie the payment for physical gas to the financial positions and suggesting that we unwind the financial positions.  Please give her a call.  Please let me know if I can be of any help.  

Thanks,
Tom McFatridge

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Hi Jeff,

I was cleaning off the desk of one of my coworkers who was laid off and found two letters from KeySpan that she had not handled.  They were both from Charles Daverio, KeySpan Utility Services LLC as agent for The Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  One letter is a termination of a master agreement between ENA and The Brooklyn Union Gas Company, dated 12/01/88, with the termination effective 10/31/04.  The other is an alternative contract quantity election effective 11/01/01 for a master agreement dated 12/08/88.  I cannot locate either of these agreements in our system.  KeySpan Utility Services LLC, as agent or otherwise, is not set up in the Global Counterparty system at all.  None of our Brooklyn Union agreements even come close in date to the ones referenced in these letters.

In light of our current situation, I wanted to check with you to see if you knew anything about either agreement being referenced.  I certainly do not wish to call the counterparty and it probably does not even matter at this point.  I do plan to send these documents to the file room, but without a contract number to file them under, the file room will not know what to do with the documentation.

Please advise.

Thanks,
SBR x30569
