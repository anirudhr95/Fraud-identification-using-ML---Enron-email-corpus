Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

"RE: COH Transport Verification","Looking at the entire transport curve was very beneficial.  They have definitely tilted the majority of costs for most areas to the Dec - Feb time frame, which is representative of this type of retail market.  On average for the season and/or the year, the transport costs are reasonable.  Let me know if I can provide any other help.

John--
Thanks so much for the information you provided to me yesterday.  It was most helpful (although I have to tell you that the people here defended their prices and still feel they are appropriate).

Anyway, since we are trying to move them toward a ""market based"" approach to the valuation of capacity (rather than an average cost of what they have paid), I would appreciate it immensely if you could look at the attachment and give feedback.  The attachment shows a one year transport curve for each of the various zones/market areas where EES is currently doing business.  Hopefully this will give you a better picture of what they really have in their system, and help resolve or dispute their argument that the shape of EES' curve justifies the fact that they may be off in just the one month of data that I gave to you yesterday.

I'm trying to finalize COH's curve validation early next week, so let me know if you can get to it by then or not.  By the way, this would be much easier if you'd just come to Retail and do the transport here...!!!

Thanks again for your help

Jeff, this Agreement should replace the GISB and any other gas agreement
between the parties.  The collateral language is incorporated into the
document.  Also, with respect to the Collateral Agreement for Duke Energy
Merchants LLC (""DEM""), Duke would like to propose assigning all of the
Enron transactions with DEM into one Enron entity and then using the form
of collateral agreement submitted to ENA (with some tweaking to allow for a
Guaranty from Duke Capital Corporation) to cover the transactions between
the Enron counterparty and DEM.  Duke can present a list of companies which
it has outstanding transactions with if Enron would like.  Please let me
know if you have any questions in this regard.  Thanks - Joe

                    08:13 PM





I was able to obtain copies of the petition, utility order and other
pleadings in the Bethlehem case via the court's internet site.  I would
like to see the contract(s) that ENA has with Bethlehem to determine
whether there is any basis to deem ENA a utility for purposes of section
366.   For our conflicts check, I need to know which Bethlehem company(ies)
the ENA contract is with.  As far as I see in the motion, only ENA is
listed as a utility.

Interestingly, in the motion, the debtor states: ""Nothing contained herein
shall constitute an admission by the Debtors that a listed entity is a
utility entitled to the protections afforded by section 366 or any other
provision of the Bankruptcy Code.""  Indeed.

Nevertheless, for the time being, the order does prohibit the ""Utility
Companies,"" which definition includes ENA, from altering, refusing or
discontinuing service to, or discriminating against, the Debtors. While
arguably ambiguous as to whether ENA is rendering a service or whether
closing out the contract is discrimination, prudence dictates complying
with the order until we get it changed.

What I'm thinking as far as strategy is that if we conclude that the
contract is a forward contract, we try to convince Bethlehem's attorneys to
remove ENA from the list of utilities and amend the motion and the order
accordingly.  If they don't and the dollars involved in closing out the
contract are significant -- bearing in mind that the order ""authorizes"" but
does not direct Bethlehem to pay postpetition invoices for services
rendered by the utilities -- then we move for a declaratory judgment that
ENA is not a utility within the meaning of section 366.

Regards.

Subject:	Potential Pluto Gathering Line Sale


Jeff,


I spoke with Stephen Noe, Director at Duke Energy Field Services, today regarding Duke's evaluation of the Pluto gathering line.  He confirmed that Duke is still in the $14 to $15 MM range for the pipeline.  He did indicate that his original evaluation did not include abandonment costs in the figure he gave me over lunch several weeks ago.  He is posturing toward the lower end of the range.  However, he did indicate that $14 MM appeared to be minimum type valuation. 

Given that Duke's price for the pipeline is still in the range Enron that will consider selling the pipeline, would you please begin drafting the purchase sale agreement and the necessary assignments for the transaction.  Attached herewith is a document that you reviewed last week regarding the schedule and structure for the transaction.  If we could have draft documents for internal review by Monday November 26, I believe that we can complete the review and send draft documents to Duke on November 29th.  

If you have any questions or identify any material issues please give me a call to discuss x-33541.


 

Thanks  ... Kevin

Subject:	VNG transportation capacity

John,
I have reviewed the contracts (Asset Agreement and the GPA) and here are my thoughts regarding your request.  In short, the agreements do not specifically address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take releases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he was going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. now), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load growth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considering the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heavily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done recallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.

My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the deliverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talking to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequent is VNG's asset manager.  

Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as well.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

It is my understanding  that during the evolution of our physical power and natural gas contract forms, there existed forms which provided only for one-way payments (defaulting party receives nothing even if 'in the money' at termination)...It has become critical that we do due diligence on an  expedited basis to identify those one-way payment contracts....based  on a ""down and dirty"" due diligence effort.. Thus, can you please have someone in your group identify for me the month and year which we changed our forms to provide for 2-way payments.  This will enable us to make a ""rough cut"" of those contracts which cannot be included  in various asset baskets.   Thanks for your prompt assistance   bng

Attached is the list of Enron entities and Hess entities to be included in the Master Collateral/Netting Agreement. 

Jeff- Can we please prepare 2 Enfolios, one for Amerada Hess Corp. and Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC. The Cross Default amounts in each contract should be $100 MM for ENA and the respective Hess entity. The collateral and MAC provisions will be contained in the Master Netting Agreement.

Frank- Please include Hess Energy Trading Company UK Limited, as agents for Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  in the Master Netting Agreement. The proposed Power of Attorney for this entity was sent to you earlier today.

Thank you all for the help and please call if you have any questions.

Subject:	Confirmation

Here is a confirmation that I have played around with and added some appropriate wordng like I would add if I were doing a deal that involved 10 percent or 20 percent swing, differernt  pricing, etc.  

I don't think I have ever had a deal where we had different pricing involving the swing language, so I made one up for you.  Let me know if this helps.

John,
Do you think you we be able to submit a quote for the facility behind COH 5-2  and/or the facility behind COH 7-3.  I am hoping to have all responses in by tomorrow morning and then, make a decision.  I hope to hear from you soon.  Also, if you did not receive the load profiles on these two facilities, I have attached them below.  Reminder:  They are looking for firm supply to the gate at a NYMEX based price.

Attached is a FERC proforma tariff.  However, each transmission provider will have its own version approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and it could contain substantial changes.  Also, the ISO tariffs are quite different and have numerous other rules.

Jeff, I have attached a marked copy of the Gas Agreement for your review.
I have tried to identify all of the changes I made to ENA's suggested
language by highlighting them in yellow.  Please note there were a couple
of additional changes which I made to the contract which reflect a new
Credit Policy which was passed by Duke's Policy Committee within the last
week and a half.  These changes can be found in a change to the Gains and
Losses definitions in the Agreement as well as a change in the treatment of
LCs  in 8.3.  Please call me once you have had an opportunity to review
these changes so we can discuss the changes and finalize the Agreement.
Thank you for your help in this matter, Joe

	Obviously, we would be willing to enter into a Master Agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron.  At this point in time we would not be willing to enter into a GISB as we would prefer working under the GTCs until the Master is hammered out.  

	If you can get credit to get us the appropriate information, we can prepare the master.

Subject:	Request for J Aron Gas Master (US and Canada)

In negotiating the cross-affiliate master netting agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron, they have inquired as to our willingness to enter into a Master Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement for US and Canada gas trading, respectively. Currently, we are trading under GTCs (online and offline). In the interim, they have also asked if we would willing to enter into a GISB to replace working under the GTCs.

I'm not really sure why we haven't gotten a master agreement in place with J Aron in the past other than neither party was focusing on the necessity of doing so. Your recollections/thoughts going forward?

"Re: Colonial Outstanding AR","According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

Terry Franklin has prepared an Appalachian Estimated TCo Metered Production for Nov 01 schedule which she will provide you.  This represents our attempt at calculating the origination dollars (at TCo Index + 1/4 cent) attributable to the TCo Metered Production.

I'm not exactly sure how to create a transfer from John Hodge's book to the Wellhead book for these dollars ($14,981).

Terry will also provide the same format to capture DTI metered production origination.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Subject:	KeySpan agreements

Hi Jeff,

I was cleaning off the desk of one of my coworkers who was laid off and found two letters from KeySpan that she had not handled.  They were both from Charles Daverio, KeySpan Utility Services LLC as agent for The Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  One letter is a termination of a master agreement between ENA and The Brooklyn Union Gas Company, dated 12/01/88, with the termination effective 10/31/04.  The other is an alternative contract quantity election effective 11/01/01 for a master agreement dated 12/08/88.  I cannot locate either of these agreements in our system.  KeySpan Utility Services LLC, as agent or otherwise, is not set up in the Global Counterparty system at all.  None of our Brooklyn Union agreements even come close in date to the ones referenced in these letters.

In light of our current situation, I wanted to check with you to see if you knew anything about either agreement being referenced.  I certainly do not wish to call the counterparty and it probably does not even matter at this point.  I do plan to send these documents to the file room, but without a contract number to file them under, the file room will not know what to do with the documentation.

Please advise.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

"Master Netting Agreement","Ms. Alexander:

	At the request of Tanya Rohauer with Enron, I am forwarding you a form Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement together with a Collateral Annex.  I will start preparing specific documents for Williams, but thought this might be a good starting place.

	I would appreciate it if you could forward these on to all appropriate parties.  In particular, if I could get the name of your lawyer so that I could forward things directly to him or her, that would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks so much.

Jeff,
The RFP is due to NDR this afternoon/tomorrow morning.  If you could please provide me with the appropriate language to include by this afternoon, I would greatly appreciate it.  Also, should I enclose a copy of our master agreement and/or a resale agreement with the RFP?  Please advise.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call Sylvia (36211) or I.
Thanks in advance for all your help.

Lindsay:

	I have looked at the material and it seems backwards to me.  I think that instead of ENA being assigned the contract between NDR and MichCon that MichCon should be assigned the supply contract between NDR and ENA.  In other words, ENA should not step into the shoes of NDR, MichCon should.

	Also, I have attached a copy of our sample Master Agreement.

Thanks,

	The above is an entity that does a lot of gas purchasing.  It has not yet been put into bankruptcy.  Given the various payments that have and will not be made, I think serious consideration should be given to filing for this entity.

Thanks,

Here is a confirmation that I have played around with and added some appropriate wordng like I would add if I were doing a deal that involved 10 percent or 20 percent swing, differernt  pricing, etc.  

I don't think I have ever had a deal where we had different pricing involving the swing language, so I made one up for you.  Let me know if this helps.

The Homestead precedent agreements are going out this week.  They should be

Subject:	Organization Announcement

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.
