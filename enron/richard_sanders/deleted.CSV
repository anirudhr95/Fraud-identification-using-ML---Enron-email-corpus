Subject:	EGM Legal Allocation

Deb, 
EGM is requesting a list of the attorneys that work on EGM cases.  Based on our allocation schedule (I have attached it again for your reference), the following cost center owners are allocating costs to EGM: Sanders, Taylor, Aronowitz, Cash.

Could you please give me a list of attorneys within these groups that work on EGM?  I realize that Aronowitz's group is 100% EGM, so a list of attorney's in that group would work.  I also realize that Michelle Cash is probably the one within her own group who would do any work for them.  In addition though, for Sanders and Taylor, can you find out from them who in their group would work on EGM?  Is it them or attorneys within their groups?

I need to have this information today if possible.

Thanks,
Edie

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation
	Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan. 

	The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB).

	In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's withdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.  The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan. 

	Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Other Contingencies
	Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

	Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for wholesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in available hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-reliance on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California's regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs and certain obligations related to the difference between third party power purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and SCE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstanding obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange (the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System Operator (the Independent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.

	Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initiatives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not possible to predict their outcome at this time.

	Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utilities, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energy in California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of these entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

	India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol Power Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constructing an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasification facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the guarantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The contract disputes relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documents and (b) MSEB's statements that MSEB has ""rescinded"" the PPA and MSEB is therefore no longer bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Phase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts for non-payment.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actions are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pursue all available legal remedies under the project documents.  As a result of these disputes, the 740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by MSEB.  Further, Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II.  Enron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

If the carrier pays to settle the case on behalf of the directors or officers does it thereby gain any subrogation rights against any third parties.  For example, would it mean the carrier, and not the company, would own the cause of action against AA?

John Devine for County Attorney 

January 22, 2002 
FROM:       John Devine 
RE:     Tuesday, February 12, 2002 Fundraiser 
As your State District Court Judge, I worked hard for you and the citizens of Harris County since 1995.  Administering justice fairly and efficiently, and standing strong on the moral values our nation was founded on, has always been my priority.  I reduced the court's case backlog by more than 40 percent, was a leader in swift and fair disposition of cases, and earned the respect of many for my ""Kids in Court"" program.  As you know, whether on the bench or in the community, my commitment has always been for making Harris County safe place for honest law abiding citizens to work, live and raise a family, and that will continue to be my top priority as your Harris County Attorney. 
As your County Attorney, I pledge to continue to be the proven, principled and proactive leader I am known to be.  As the peoples' attorney, I will be your voice and advocate - protecting the law-abiding taxpayer and holding government accountable for its actions.  My commitment to these principles is unwavering. 
I respectfully ask you for your financial support at my upcoming fundraiser.  Your support of my campaign is important and much appreciated.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 713-681-1996 or via fax at 713-681-8402.

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

	The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

	Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know if any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.

	I will keep you updated.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Additionally, please ask someone in your group to get us examples prior to such meeting of what is submitted to ERCOT in connection with (1) scheduling load represented by EPMI acting as QSE, and (2) scheduling in relation to congestion occurring between zones.

"Enron Petrochemicals, Inc. v. Odjfell Terminals (Baytank) Inc.","	

	Dear Mr. Netland:

	I am an assistant general counsel with the Enron Litigation Unit, and have been retained in this matter by Enron Petrochemicals, Inc.  The matter arises out of the contamination of approximately 6,000,000 pounds of styrene monomer while in a tank located in a Odfjell Terminals (Baytank) Inc. facility on or about November 4, 1999.  Enron believes that the contamination was the result of the negligence of Baytank.  The two-year Texas tort statute of limitations is approaching and we would request an extension of the suit filing time for a period of sixty (60) days.  As we may otherwise have to file suit this week, we would appreciate your immediate response.  If you are not the person authorized to agree to such an extension, please let me know as soon as possible who is.

	My direct telephone line is (713)-853-6307, my telefax number is (713)-853-6576, and my e-mail is ""britt.davis@enron.com.""

	I appreciate your courtesy.

"RSM v. El Paso","
	Andy and Richard,

	By hand-delivery I will shortly send to you a copy of the underlying contract on which RSM bases its right to file this suit.  Having read it, I think I recall having seen it years ago when it was distributed in the Grynberg suit by Mike Noone of the Beatty Law Firm.  Long and short, Jack Grynberg signed this contract as chairman and CEO of RSM with the County of Zapata (the only other party; the Zapata Independent School District is not named in the contract, although it is named in the lawsuit) in 1997.  

	It is basically a retainer agreement that purports to give RSM the right to collect unpaid ad valorem taxes on behalf of the County of Zapata, Texas (again, not mentioning that it would be on behalf of the Zapata Independent School District).  Grynberg agrees to front the litigation costs and gets 40% of any taxes and fees recovered.  I see little difference between this agreement and what a plaintiff's law firm would have required.  

	This strikes me as a blatant attempt to create by contract what does not exist by statute:  a Texas qui tam action (you may recall that a Texas qui tam bill even broader than the federal act was pending in the Legislature last year, but was not passed).  I also wonder whether this amounts to the unauthorized practice of law, barratry, etc.

	Given that the contract was signed in 1997 and that recovery in the Zapata County suit would probably be very small compared to the nation-wide qui tam action even in a worst-case situation for the defendants, the view is that Grynberg may have filed this primarily because both his nationwide qui tam action and the Quinque action stalled and Grynberg needs merits discovery as quickly as possible to bolster his original source position.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation
	Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan. 

	The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB).

	In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's withdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.  The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan. 

	Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Other Contingencies
	Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

	Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for wholesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in available hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-reliance on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California's regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs and certain obligations related to the difference between third party power purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and SCE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstanding obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange (the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System Operator (the Independent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.

	Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initiatives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not possible to predict their outcome at this time.

	Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utilities, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energy in California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of these entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

	India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol Power Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constructing an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasification facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the guarantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The contract disputes relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documents and (b) MSEB's statements that MSEB has ""rescinded"" the PPA and MSEB is therefore no longer bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Phase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts for non-payment.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actions are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pursue all available legal remedies under the project documents.  As a result of these disputes, the 740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by MSEB.  Further, Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II.  Enron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

Subject:	RE: Crescendo

Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investment done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in Utah and Colorado..............the ""Crescendo entity"" is managed by non-Enron personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears that Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine the relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and Sullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM............Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Josey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know if any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.

I will keep you updated.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Enron Petrochemicals v. Baytank","
	Steve,

	Per your advice, I have removed the ""excessive heat"" allegation in the petition.  How does it look to you now?

	Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  You confirmed that while we know for sure that the contamination didn't occur prior to October 28, and that it was discovered on or about November 4, we don't know for an absolute certainty that it didn't occur, say, on October 29, 1999.  Accordingly, if Baytank won't grant us an extension of time to file suit against it (and you, Richard and Jim were bcc'd on the e-mail I just sent to the president of some Baytank entity asking for such an extension), then I want to be ready to file this suit on Friday.

	A related point:  I have included the name of the Baytank entity with whom Philchem executed the Marketing Agreement, which is the only Baytank corporate entity that I know of that had some responsibility for the contamination.  However, the Marketing Agreement does not say whether that Baytank entity owns, leases or operates the facilities in question.  It would be preferable to name any and all Baytank entites that own, lease or operate the facility in question.  Short of calling Baytank and asking, do you know how we could find this out very quickly?

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"FW: In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters","	Richard

	I got another call from Steve Knight of Philchem about this.  Should you and I set up a time to discuss?  I think we need to go forward with the claim against Underwriters as soon as possible, but at the same time, I don't recommend (a) going forward on a third-party action against either Baytank or Philchem and (b) I think we need to dissuade Underwriters from thinking about a subrogation against Baytank or Philchem.

	Let me know when you'd like to talk.

	Richard,

	I apologize for not getting back to you more quickly on this; frankly, I keep hoping I can think of a clear solution to this problematic file, but with no success.  We are coming up on a Texas two-year tort statute of limitions in November.

	My previous e-mail to you details what a can of worms this matter is for us.  Since that e-mail, I have focused my review on the very troublesome ""boomerang"" indemnity aspect of this matter--whether anything we recover from Baytank or Underwriters we might have to turn right around and pay back to Philchem if, as is likely, Philchem gets sued by Baytank for indemnity, and if Philchem then sues us for breach of our marketing agreement with Philchem.  

	My conclusion is that we in fact do run a substantial risk of that happening, based on my view of Baytank's explicit indemnity rights against Philchem under the Terminalling Agreement between them and the clear intent of the Enron and Philchem in the Marketing Agreement for Philchem not to be liable for anything except pollution liability, hazardous waste disposal, etc.  While this intent is not specifically spelled out, Janice Moore, who wrote Enron/Philchem contract, told me this was the only reason for the contract (otherwise, Enron would have entered into the Terminalling Agreement directly with Baytank), and Steve Knight with Philchem never loses the chance to say that Enron and Philchem were partners.  Philchem was basically acting as the marketing arm of Enron for this product.  John Nowlan was involved in the drafting of the Marketing Agreement; I haven't spoken to him about it.

	 All this is of course assuming that Baytank couldn't either (a) get a no-duty summary judgment granted against Enron if Enron filed a tort claim against Baytank or (b) at least have the damage limitation provisions of the terminalling agreement applied to such a tort claim.  Under (b), Enron probably couldn't recover more from Baytank than what Enron could get from Underwriters.  

	My recommendation--go get as much as we can from Underwriters, but do everything we can to dissuade them from pursuing a subrogation action against Philchem (and I think there is what amounts to a waiver of subrogation clause there anyway)  or a subrogation action against Baytank, which will undoubtedly trigger an indemnity action against Philchem.  Of course, this will probably limit us to a recovery of about $250K at best, and we have this matter on our books for about $900K.

	Parenthetically, I just got a call from Steve Knight of Philchem a week or so ago.  Although Philchem has stopped doing business, he is keeping a reserve in case we decide to sue him and wants his accountants to be able to let it go.  We might be able to get a small settlement out of him to add to whatever we get from Underwriters.

	Let me know what you think.  I haven't given this news to Steve Elliott yet.

	Britt 

	P.S. to Andy:  I don't know if this is now one of your files, so I am reporting to you on it as well.

Subject:	In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters
Importance:	High


	Richard,

	This is the styrene monomer contamination claim that arose in November of 1999 and that involves Philchem and Baytank.  Steve Elliott is the trader.  We probably have the claim on our books valued at around $900,000.  It continues to be problematic.

	Here's the big picture for Enron Petrochemical's recovery prospects:

	1.  Underwriters are correctly relying on the declared value provisions of our policy to limit Enron's total recovery to about $250,000 (this is what Underwriters' adjuster said she would consider settling for at one time, subject to receipt of additional documentation; I have also seen subsequent correspondence from her in January of this year where she says that due to prejudice to her third party rights, she would only consider settling for about $65,000).  To the extent Underwriters pay, they are probably entitled to subrogate and get their money back first.

	2.  Philchem's contract with Enron Petrochemicals contains onerous (for us) limitation of damages clauses.  I am told that the only reason for the Enron/Philchem contract was to prevent Enron from being in privity with Baytank and potentially having some exposure for spills.  Otherwise, Philchem basically acts as Enron's marketing arm.  Consequently, Philchem was allowed to effectively insulate itself from liability in a situation like this.  First, to the extent Underwriters have paid us, we can't recover such payments again from Philchem (and neither can Underwriters).  Second, to the extent that Baytank isn't liable to us for damages, we have to pay it.  Last, the only liability theory explicitly mentioned by the contract is based on negligence, and it would be very difficult for us to prove Philchem was negligent, unless that negligence could be imputed from Baytank, which I don't think is likely.

	3. Philchem's contract with Baytank also contains onerous (for Philchem and us) limitation of damages clauses as well.  That contract explicitly limits Philchem's recovery to (a) causes of action based on negligence for (b) the lesser of the actual cost of the product to Philchem, or a certain dollar amount, whichever is less.  My gut is that these provisions may limit Enron/Philchem to even less than what Enron could recover from Underwriters, and of course the Underwriters would get the first $250,000 anyway.

	Because of these substantial problems, I am working on a direct tort action by Enron Petrochemicals against Baytank.  There are, however, substantial problems with that approach as well, as follows:

	1.  Does Baytank owe Enron Petrochemicals a duty?  According to Steve Elliott, Baytank may not have known it was Enron's product.  I would need evidence of custom and practice in the industry that Baytank customarily contracts with parties who put product owned by others in Baytank's tanks with same or similar contract language.  There is also language in the contract that states that as between Philchem and Baytank, Philchem retains the title to the property at all times.  That language probably wasn't meant to apply to this situation, but I could see Baytank's lawyers saying it means that Philchem could only put product to which it had title in Baytank's tanks.

	2.  Is Enron bound by the limitations of remedies clauses in the Philchem/Baytank contract under some partnership, joint venturer, principal/agent, third part obligor or other theory?  The Enron/Philchem contract expressly denies that it creates a partnership, joint venture, or principal/agent relationship, but I think a Court/jury will really be leaning in Baytank's favor once it becomes aware of the primary reason for the Enron/Philchem contract (to insulate Enron from possible liability for a spill, while otherwise giving Enron the benefit of the Baytank contract).  The Enron/Philchem contract in fact attaches a copy of the executed Philchem/Baytank contract.

	3.  Will even an otherwise valid direct tort action against Baytank ultimately boomerang on Enron through the indemnity clauses in both contracts?  This is huge.  It makes no sense for Enron to go after Baytank and spend substantial attorneys' fees if Enron will ultimately have to pay back any recovery to Philchem.

	4.  It gets worse if you consider Underwriters' subrogation rights.  Supposed Enron gets paid $250,000 by Underwriters, and Enron recovers $250,000 from Baytank.  Underwriters keep the $250,000.  Baytank goes after Philchem, who goes after us.  If I'm right on the indemnity boomerang, Enron would actually pay what it recovered from Underwriters to Philchem.  If this is correct, our best case may be to get our insurance claim paid and discourage Underwriters from going after Baytank!  

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

"Re: further report","I believe that SDI's lawyer may have been telling the truth when he said that
Enron was not brought in to the Cleveland settlement discussions, because SDI
and McDonald were doing a larger deal with Schultes.  We refused to join in
their deal in Los Angeles (because it left the Cleveland action alive.)  And,
during the last 45 days, McDonald and SDI have been dismissing claims against
Schultes all around the country.  Something larger does appear to be going on.

>>> ""cesherman@hahnlaw.com"" 11/15/01 01:45PM >>>
by now you should all have by fax the dismissals filed today in the schultes
case, including the gift to us of a dismissal of the contract counts (1-4)
against the enron entities as well!  i spoke with counsel for sdi, who -
despite confidentiality restrictions - confirmed my instinct that the
defendants were concerned that they could be brought back in if the contract
claims still existed against us.  i have to think harder as to whether they're
really off the hook on the tort counts, but it's at least reassuring they
thought so.

interesting as well, the defendants apparently urged the plaintiff to just
dismiss us. his lawyer apparently rejected the suggestion with the explanation
that we could pay too.  they responded ""for what""? and apparently the
plaintiff's counsel just repeated the same response.  if it offers any
comfort, sdi's lawyer can't imagine any case schultes has to proceed against
us on.

i asked why we hadn't been broached to join in, and the only explanation i got
- which didn't seem really to be enough of an answer - was that this was just
part of a bigger settlement of the securities cases.  for our info, have there
been such settlements?

the ""big"" strategic question now is do we just wait to hear from the court or
plaintiff's counsel, or do we push for a hearing.  thoughts?

"RE: Subrogation","In order to answer your question, a very complicated analysis needs to be performed. One of the questions that needs to be addressed is who owns the proceeds of the insurance policy.  Are the D&O's entitled to the proceeds or are the proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate?  Another question that needs to be looked into is the nature and scope of the coverages available.  Yet another consideration is competing claims against the policy.  The AEGIS form for the first 35 million is very sophisticated and the endorsements need to be fully understood.  The next step in the analysis is the excess which is not fully follow form. Jim Bouillion and  I have scheduled an all day meeting with Gary Cooney (Vice Chairman of MSW) on Tuesday to discuss D & O cover. This is the first time that Mr. Cooney can come to Houston.  After this meeting, I hope to be in a position to identify issues for your consideration.  If any of you would like to attend this meeting, please advise.   If you would like to discuss any of these issues with me over the weekend, my home number is 713 721-7676.  I will be in the office early on Monday morning.  My extension is 37535.

 BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE ENRON BROADBAND SERVICES-MICROSOFT DEAL, MSN   
WILL HAVE TO TEMPORARILY LIMIT DELIVERY OF ITS NEW HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICES 
TO THE 14 STATES COVERED BY QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. (Q), SAID   
BOB VISSE, DIRECTOR OF MSN MARKETING.                                           
   THOSE 14 STATES ARE ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO, COLORADO, WYOMING, IDAHO, IOWA,     
MINNESOTA, SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTH DAKOTA, MONTANA, NEBRASKA, OREGON, UTAH AND      
WASHINGTON.                                                                     
   THE ENRON DEAL WAS TO PROVIDE BACKBONE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE QWEST AREA,   
VISSE SAID. BACKBONES PROVIDE LONGHAUL SERVICES THAT CONNECT SMALLER AREAS OF   
NETWORKS.                                                                       
   AN ANALYST, WHO DIDN'T WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED, EXPRESSED SHOCK WHEN TOLD THAT 
THE DISAGREEMENT WOULD LIMIT THE NEW MSN BROADBAND SERVICES TO THE 14-STATE     
QWEST REGION. THAT CALLS INTO QUESTION THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE ENRON      
BROADBAND NETWORK, HE SAID.                                                     
                                                                          (CONT)
   MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY BACKBONE SERVICES AND MSN 
WILL FIND ONE, MSN'S VISSE SAID.                                                
   THE NEW SERVICE WAS JUST LAUNCHED THURSDAY SO THERE WEREN'T EXISTING         
CUSTOMERS IN THE AREAS OUTSIDE THE QWEST REGION, HE SAID.                       
   VISSE WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THE LAWSUIT FILED BY ENRON BECAUSE MICROSOFT HASN'T
REVIEWED IT IN DETAIL. COMMENTING WOULD VIOLATE THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT     
MICROSOFT HAS WITH ENRON, HE ADDED.                                             
   ""WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE FULLY UPHELD THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT,"" HE SAID.    
   MICROSOFT HASN'T FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST ENRON RELATING TO THE DEAL, HE      
ADDED. HE WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A SUIT.                   
   IN RECENT TRADING, SHARES OF ENRON WERE DOWN 66 CENTS, OR 4.04%, TO $15.69.  
SHARES OF MICROSOFT WERE OFF 15 CENTS, OR 0.25%, AT $62.63.

Subject:	MSN

The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know if any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.

I will keep you updated.

Andy

hello love.  flat stanley needs a few more photos, but will be back a bit
after thanksgiving.  tell sam that stan and are having a guten time.

cheers for continuing to take initiative with the pedernales (and for
ceasing to call it a ranch).  good on you.  in regards to the bulldozer to
take a path to the swimming hole, you best think twice about that.  of
course that has been bandied about for some ten years now, but there is no
easy solution.  bulldozers cost a buttload, and it wouldn't be able to make
it all the way down to the waters' edge anyway - boulders are too big and
the floods will destroy any path for twenty five to thirty yards from the
river.

resign yourself to the fact that we will never have a lovely footpath to the
swimming hole - that land is much different from the land through which the
guadelupe runs.  we can definitely, however, improve on what there is now,
which is primarily a game track slightly improved by myself on the upper
reaches close to the yard.  not so sure about the bulldozer....

good luck getting everyone together.  hope all is well with y'all.  am off
on a date just now - keep well -

rolland

"RSM Production v. El Paso","
	A couple of suggestions on which I would appreciate your response:

	1.  I believe we need to have internal due diligence/factual investigation done on whether any of the Enron entities served--Enron Corp.(of which Northern was a division for a period of time), Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. (EGM) or Intratex ever gathered gas, was the first measurer of gas, or provided measurement of gas on which ad valorem taxes were calculated, for Zapata County or communitized wells in adjacent counties that included leases located in whole or in part in Zapata County.  The petition specifically mentions that it includes acts going back to 1974 and earlier, so I would like to see how far back we can fairly easily put together a chronology.  What I hope to have is a time line of who did what and during what period of time, and locate the most important documents to show this.  

	I am assuming that EGM was at all times only a marketer, although we need to do the due diligence to make sure.  Enron Corp. will be pretty easy, although Northern was for a brief period of time in the early 90s a division of Enron Corp., and Northern had non-contiguous gathering in South Texas that stopped right at the Zapata County line.  If that gathering system took gas from, say, a well in an adjacent county that was communitized with a lease in Zapata County, Enron Corp. may stay in the picture.  Last, with respect to Intratex, I am told by Lou that we no longer have the Intratex documents; did they go with HPL as a result of the sale? 

	Becky and I are stretched thin on various matters right now and would like to suggest that we retain Marianne Salinas on this project immediately.  

	2. I think it would be helpful to snag a first-rate gas measurement consultant now, before they all get taken.  I know Ken Cessac, who works here, very well, and think a great deal of him.  I know Andy has used him extensively already in Grynberg-related matters.  You may want to save money and not retain our own consultant, and instead rely on Ken; however, I know that Ken is being kept very busy.  On the other hand, I also think it is likely that we will wind up sharing at least the testifying gas measurement experts and their costs.  So, this is a judgment call.  However, I would be inclined to go ahead and retain Paul LaNasa, who sits on several AGA committees, as an Enron-only consulting expert, even though I don't think he is up to speed on the Grynberg allegations.  Both Grant Harvy and I were very impressed by him during the Northern v. ONEOK arbitration, during which we worked with him extensively and presented him as an expert witness (although I don't proposed to use him as a testifying expert here).  My point would be that if there was anything wrong with Enron's measurement that was either worse than or better than our co-defendants' measurement,  or put us in a different position, I am very confident he could point it out to us.  

	I appreciate your thoughts.

	Britt

"In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters/M/V PACIFIC VIRGO (ECTRS Claim Against Underwriters)/M/V INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE (EEPC Claim Against Underwriters)","
	Ladies and Gentlemen:

	Yesterday,  Ted Rosen (a partner with Wortham's, our broker on the insurance policy on all three of these claims) and I spoke with Sharron West, the contract adjuster for Underwriters, about the status of a response to our request for extensions of time in all these cases, which she received by fax last Friday.

	West advised that she had transmitted this request to Underwriters with her recommendation that it be granted.  West anticipates an answer by this Friday.  West will be largely out of town on vacation between Christmas and the New Year, and volunteered that she did not want to be bothered with responding to lawsuits during the few days she would be in the office.

	As I told Ron, I have a high degree of confidence that our request will be granted.

	I will report further tomorrow.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

"RSM Production v. El Paso","
	Marianne,

	ASAP, can you find out whether any of the Enron entities named in this suit have ever paid any taxes assessed by the County of Zapata or the Zapata County Independent School District?  The kind of taxes would be ad valorem taxes.  We have a whole tax department that deals with that stuff.  Besides the Enron defendants named in this suit, see if any Enron entity ever paid these taxes for Zapata County.

	Please keep me closely advised of your progress.

	Thanks.

	Britt

Subject:	Payment

Jim/Stan,
I wanted to let you know that the DR team was able to get payment of $8.9 million from the CDE.  While we are still awaiting conversion of approximately $2.3 million (from Pesos) to clear to our account, the funds are out of the control of the CDE and are 'good'.  Based on the state of affairs today, we will be able to pay the lenders their approximately $12.3 million of principal and interest by tomorrow afternoon; the payment due date is Monday.

The local DR team, lead by Otto, did a superb job under very adverse circumstances.  Congratulations and thanks for a great effort.

Mariella

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"monthly update","as i previously reported, all of the other defendants settled with the plaintiff. significantly, their settlement included the dismissal of the most onerous (contract) counts (1 thru 4) against the enron defendants as well.   today we received a host of such notices from the court reflecting these developments.

in addition, the court ordered a settlement conference for December 12 at 1:30, and specifically ordered that all clients be present.  we accordingly need at this juncture to discuss your posture as to settlement.  we also need to know whether you think you should attend this conference, and if so, whether the date works for you.  (if not, i can attempt to have it rescheduled).  if you don't think you need to be there, i can try to have you hooked in by phone.  so let us know your thoughts.  even if your position is still not to offer anything, this conference should provide a terrific opportunity to set the stage for the judge about our confidence in the merits of our pending motions.

copies of the notices are on their way to all of you. please get back to me at your earliest convenience with your thoughts on settlement and the conference.

"FW: Fee Letter Summary","What do you think about this? The first attachment is what you and I discussed Vasco.  The second is what SBA originally proposed.  Keep in mind that SBA has offered a 30% reduction on the original fees if another LDC retains him, but as you said, even those reduced fees seemed high to one of the LDC's who reviewed them, so we may not get the reduction.  I don't want to rely on that.

"MSN","The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know if any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.

I will keep you updated.

Howard:

I understand that Lisa expressed our concerns about the Case's progress
yesterday.   Enron would ask that we have an agenda circulated prior to the
call which in addition to the previous items encompasses two items:

1. Progress on submitting a Plan
2. Controlling and directing professional resources (expenses)

Sent:	Tuesday, October 16, 2001 1:48 PM
To:	Brownfeld, Gail
Cc:	Zikes, Becky; Carrier, Lee; Cheek, Charles; Vote, Robert; White, Bonnie; Sanders, Richard B.
Subject:	RSM Production Corporation v. El Paso


	Gail,

	I hope you are doing well.  Richard asked me this morning, subject to Jim Derrick's approval, to act as trial counsel in this ""Grynberg copycat"" case for Enron Corp., Intratex Gas Company, and Enron Gas Marketing (EOG has also been named, but I don't know if they have been served, or if served, whether we would be representing them as well). It is an alleged gas undermeasurement case filed in the 49th Judicial District Court of Zapata County by a private company claiming to represent the Zapata School District, the County of Zapata, and the State of Texas against a whole raft of pipeline companies and other companies.  Plaintiffs' counsel are Jose A. Lopez of the Law Office Of Jose A. Lopez in Zapata, Texas, Patrick W. Pendley of Patrick W. Pendley A.P.L.C., Plaquemine, Louisiana, L. Brent Farney of San Antonio, Texas, and Mayo J. Galindo of San Antonio, Texas.

	Richard told me you were handling a case in Zapata county with Sussman's firm, and have local counsel.  Would you please let me who that person is and whether you think that person would be a good fit in this case?  Many thanks.

	Britt 

	P.S.:  Bob, Richard will be speaking with Armogida about this as well.

"Good Stuff on Tap This Week","
Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication
To:       Kansasjdt
From:   Don Schultz
Re:       10/25 call
            Please  try to participate in this week's JDT-wide  conference call. We will  have a lot on the agenda.   So far, I have identified the following  items you should be thinking about.
           1.   Reply Brief to Motion to Dismiss.  We hope to  stimulate/provide argument suggestions to the authors who are starting  on the reply brief, on the front end.  Time will be short for review and  comments later, since the brief is due Nov. 2.  Please read the  plaintiff's opposition brief and be prepared to provide the drafters with  your suggestions about reply arguments up front.  If you send those to ddavis@hollandhart.com   by  email, we'll circulate them before the call to help the discussion proceed more  efficiently.
           2.   Discovery Responses on Personal Jurisdiction.
              a.  The Discovery Committee will discuss whether the provision of Judge  Smith's written order, reminding Sharp that he has to confer before any motion  to compel is intended to substitute for the oral request the judge made that all  objections be filed in advance.
           b.  Please  reconsider how completely your clients have responded to the ""Kansas  contacts"" discovery.  Defendants who qualified or limited their  ""Kansas contacts"" answers to provide information only as to contacts  related to gas measurement in Kansas, may want to reconsider those limitations  and work to supplement the answers in order to provide a more complete picture  of a defendant's Kansas contacts, to avoid having the personal jurisdiction  motions bogged down in discovery disputes or delays - at least we should try to  come to a consensus about that strategically.
         c.  Please reconsider  what objections you have made to the ""Kansas contacts"" discovery requests the  Judge has ordered us to respond to.   We'll have to decide whether to  present objections to the judge up-front and should consider what we should  or should not do to narrow those potential disputes.
           3.   Personal Jurisdiction Motion to Dismiss.   Larry Tanenbaum reminds me  we are only about six weeks away from having to file the affidavits and brief(s)  on personal jurisdiction, with a Thanksgiving holiday in the  interim.   Yikes!   Obviously the work to answer the  discovery will dovetail a lot with the work needed to revise or prepare  affidavits to support p.jd. dismissal.  We'll try to come up with a game  plan to get affidavits in to Gerry Pecht for coordinated review before they are  finalized, and to make sure we are proceeding with a good time line to  finalize the p.jd. papers.
         4.   Case  Management Order.   It seems clear, I think, that we should hold to  the current p.jd. filing and hearing schedule, in order to dissuade a bunch of  follow up discovery on Kansas contacts or risk having class cert decided ahead  of p.jd.    Should we also seek to resist Plaintiff's preliminary  suggestions that the class cert briefing and argument should be delayed -  Moore/QUinque problems notwithstanding - on the premise that we are better  prepared to oppose class cert than the plaintiffs are to support it?  Or  should we negotiate with Sharp to slide the class cert back and how much?
        Please let me know if you think  there are other issues we should discuss.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

A: Log into iPayit and Reject the invoice.  In the comment section, please state that the invoice needs to be deleted because it has already been paid.

Q: What if the invoice does not belong to me?
A: If you know who it belongs to, log into iPayit and Forward the invoice to the proper individual who is responsible for coding and approving the invoice.  If you don't know who the invoice belongs to, log into iPayit and Reject the invoice.  In the comment section, state that the invoice was routed to the wrong person.

Q: What if I am waiting on some information on the invoice (such as proper coding) and the invoice is truly pending?

"Payment of vital vendors","
Richard - I understand from Hardie Davis that he has spoken to you regarding payments of outstanding invoices and payment of future services to certain vendors without whom we cannot do business.

In the field of corporate secretary services we urgently need the assistance of Premier Corporate Services and Capital Services to be able to pursue the future business plan.  Without their services we cannot quickly incorporate a company or qualify a company to do business in other states.  We cannot obtain certified documents from the Secretaries of State for future asset sales. Hardie Davis has already given you details of the $$ amounts in question.  

I believe that you may have already been approached regarding similar vital services from in-country managers who handle hundreds of our companies in The Netherlands, Cayman Islands, and Mauritius.  These companies control our corporate records and they will not provide further assistance unless their invoices are paid.

If you require additional information please call me at the below number.  I look forward to hearing from you most urgently.

"RSM Production Corporation v. El Paso","
	Gail,

	I hope you are doing well.  Richard asked me this morning, subject to Jim Derrick's approval, to act as trial counsel in this ""Grynberg copycat"" case for Enron Corp., Intratex Gas Company, and Enron Gas Marketing (EOG has also been named, but I don't know if they have been served, or if served, whether we would be representing them as well). It is an alleged gas undermeasurement case filed in the 49th Judicial District Court of Zapata County by a private company claiming to represent the Zapata School District, the County of Zapata, and the State of Texas against a whole raft of pipeline companies and other companies.  Plaintiffs' counsel are Jose A. Lopez of the Law Office Of Jose A. Lopez in Zapata, Texas, Patrick W. Pendley of Patrick W. Pendley A.P.L.C., Plaquemine, Louisiana, L. Brent Farney of San Antonio, Texas, and Mayo J. Galindo of San Antonio, Texas.

	Richard told me you were handling a case in Zapata county with Sussman's firm, and have local counsel.  Would you please let me who that person is and whether you think that person would be a good fit in this case?  Many thanks.

	Britt 

	P.S.:  Bob, Richard will be speaking with Armogida about this as well.

"Personal News","Although this is definitely not the best way to announce it, today is my last day at Enron Canada Corp. and I wanted to let you know that it has been a real pleasure working with you over the last couple of years.  I apologize for letting you know by e-mail instead of giving you a call.  Unfortunately, the mechanics of my employment change required me to avoid phoning you all earlier.  

Just so you know, I am returning to my old job in the world of private practice at Bennett Jones LLP here in Calgary.  I do not have my new e-mail address or phone number yet but you can reach me at the main switchboard at (403) 298-3100 starting December 3, 2001.  My mugshot, direct line and e-mail address should be appearing on the Bennett Jones website (www.bennettjones.ca) within the next month.  In the meantime, I will be taking a couple of weeks to spend with my wife and 3 month old son Jimmy.

I wish nothing but the best for you and if you ever find yourself in the Great White North of Calgary, please give me a call.

All the best,

"Credit Union Changes","What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

Michelle thanks, from the logistics point of view I would recommend to do Guatemala,fly to Nicaragua as it's a short 30 min. flight.
From there Panama City is about 1hr.15min.
The next  jump would be  to Venezuela where VENGAS and ACCRO (30 min from Caracas) where you could do a direct flight home back to Houston.
That would be my recommendation.
I will be checking with Guatemala on the  November date.

"CalPX - Hearing before Judge Kuhl re Ex parte","Yesterday, George Caplan and I attended a hearing before Judge Kuhl on the
Committee's ex parte application shortening time to hear its motion to
enforce the stipulation with the state regarding rejection of the claims
before the VCB.

After hearing brief argument, the Judge made it very clear that the State
needed to sign the stipulation.  In fact, the Judge waited around all day
until the State signed a stipulation (which will be submitted to the VCB
shortly) whereby the State agreed that the consolidated claims pending
before the VCB should be summarily rejected as unduly complex and that all
administrative remedies regarding the inverse condemnation claims on the
commandeered contracts have been exhausted.

The Judge, however, was reluctant to enter our proposed order (which
declared that the VCB proceedings were moot and that the parties no longer
needed to participate in those proceedings).

Please call if you have any questions

"In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters","
	Steve,

	This will confirm your advice to go forward with our claim against Underwriters, subject to your boss also wanting you to go forward with a third-party action against Baytank.  I will liaise with Jim on the additional information he needs to present to Sharron West.  Also, I will prepare a lawsuit for filing against Baytank to protect the statute of limitations in case either your boss or Underwriters want to go after Baytank (which, again, Richard and I recommend against, given the limitation of liability and indemnity problems we mentioned).  Again, the Texas two-year tort statute of limitations expires November 1.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

	P.S:  Becky, this will confirm my voice-mail to you.  I need to review the notebook of additional invoices that you prepared immediately and then copy and messenger it to Jim.

	P.S: Jim, would it make sense for you, me and perhaps Ted Rosen to sit down with this claim again tomorrow and run through the additional documents, to refresh everyone's recollection, preparatory to a meeting with Sharron West?

Danielle,

Thank you for the invitation to discuss scheduling activities for the month of August. As I am sure you are aware this company is undergoing a significant period of turmoil. It would therefore be of great help if you could send a list of specific questions so that we may be able to answer them directly.

If it would aid your understanding of our activity, we have full requirement obligations in both the North and South zones that were to ramp up starting in July. This load was to reach in excess of 100 MW by September. However, the speed of switching and the location of this load were not known. In addition, we have resources off 2 power plants, both located in the South. One of these plants is consistently subjected to various types of command and control dispatch by the ISO and we are obligated to find a market for any residual energy. 

I trust this paints a picture of what we do and can help clarify any questions you may have. At this time, I do not feel we are in a position to comment on the actions of other QSEs as any information we have would be purely anecdotal.

I trust all is well,

Doug Gilbert-Smith
Director, Ercot Trading

	Would you let me know how you are doing on the revisions that we discussed to your good due diligence memo in this matter?  There is another joint defense conference call coming up on Thursday at 1:30, and I'd like to see where you are.  FYI, AEP's attorneys have agreed to allow me to speak with Steve Schneider of HPL about what he recalls any Enron entity had down in Zapata County.  I have a call in to Steve and hope to speak with him before 2:30 today or tomorrow morning.

	Many thanks.

"RE: Costilla/Motion to Stay","The Costilla bankruptcy is pending in the court of Judge Ronald B. King, in
the Midland Division of the Western District of Texas.  I spoke today with
Jana, Judge King's clerk, about the Motion for Stay of Harris County Lawsuit
that Costilla sent on October 19, 2001.  Here is what I learned:

1.  The Motion was actually filed today.   It has not yet reached Judge
King's chambers, and Judge King has not seen it.

2.  Under local Rule 9014, negative notice language is required to be placed
in most motions.  The negative notice language says:  ""THIS PLEADING
REQUESTS RELIEF THAT MAY BE ADVERSE TO YOUR INTERESTS.  IF NOT TIMELY
RESPONSE IS FILED WITHINT TWENTY (20) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE, THE
RELIEF REQUESTED HEREIN MAY BE GRANTED WITHOUT A HEARING BEING HELD.  A
TIMELY FILED RESPONSE IS NECESSARY FOR A HEARING TO BE HELD.""

3.  The Costilla motion does not include this negative notice language.
Local rule 9014 of the Western District says that the negative notice
language should not be included in ""matters upon which a hearing is
specifically required by the Bankruptcy Code or by applicable rules,"" or
""matters that require the Court to act within a shortened time frame.""

4.  This is the type of motion that the Judge would normally set for
hearing, and that's what Jana expects will happen here.  If it is set for
hearing, the earliest hearing date would likely be the end of November.

5.  Jana will tell the Judge that we want an opportunity to respond to the
motion.  We will get notice of any hearing.  If the judge sets a hearing, he
may request a response within some specific period.  Jana says it is
unlikely that the Judge would give us less than 25 days or so.

I think that just to be safe, we should prepare to submit a response no
later than November 8, which is 20 days after the motion was mailed.

Subject: Costilla/Motion to Stay


	Bonnie White, the Enron attorney who filed the Harris County
answer on behalf of JEDI, sent me a copy of a Motion for Stay of Harris
County Lawsuit which was filed by George Hicks, Costilla's litigation
trustee, in the US BR Court in Midland.  I am having it faxed to you.
	Hicks is represented by Akin Gump who argue that, the Hall law
firm, although experts in commercial litigation and personal injury
cases (whatever), is inexperienced in BR proceedings and  filed suit on
behalf of the wrong entity. Ooops.  Thereafter, they figured out that
they had sued in the wrong name and (coincidently) also figured out that
they wanted to sue ""where the property made the subject of the suit"" was
located (and where Judge Bland wasn't)...Zapata County.  After spending
a paragraph or so feigning ignorance about why JEDI (inexplicably)
answered the Harris County case when it hadn't been served, they argue
that Costilla's lack of authority to sue in its own name as well as the
bankruptcy protection afforded to Costilla require that the case be
stayed.  My favorite part is in paragraph 7 when Akin Gump argues that
counsel ""was voluntarily preparing"" to dismiss the Harris County case.
	No Notice of Hearing was attached; however, I think we ought to
get something into the BR court as soon as possible. By copy of this
e-mail, I'm letting Bonnie know that you guys are on this and that she's
off the hook.  You may want to file a Notice of Substitution in Harris
County so that everything comes directly to y'all.
	Please call me to discuss this when you get a chance. Thanks.

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Subject: Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy



Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE. 

1.      Form Enron Negotiation Team 

        My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.      Meet & Confer (10/29) 

        Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.      Reformed Stipulation 

        I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.      Meeting 

        My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees. 

Thanks, 

Jim

"Interim Funding for CalPX","As we discussed during our last meeting, the Committee needs to address the
question of interim funding for CalPX from this point until the effective
date of the proposed Plan, which is estimated to be February or March 2002.
There is a hearing before the district court on December 3 to discuss the
CalPX's pending budget motion.  The Committee needs to be in a position to
provide the new district court judge the Committee's position on interim
funding for the CalPX at that Dec 3 hearing.  We have previously discussed
an approach that would provide interim funding as an advance from the
settlement reserve account pursuant to the approval of both the district
court and the bankruptcy court after notice has been provided to all
parties, including Participants.

The approach discussed below is, as we have discussed, predicated on the
fact that the bankruptcy judge and the US Trustee, as well as the district
court, expect the general unsecured claims of the vendors and suppliers to
be paid in full or settled in an agreed upon amount.  Committee counsel
continues to discuss a resolution of these unsecured claims with the
attorneys for the general unsecured creditors' committee and the CalPX's
counsel, but the claim of OM is still being addressed.  In the meantime, the
Committee has estimated that $8 million would be enough to resolve general
unsecured claims.

Here is a proposal the Committee should address at its next meeting on Nov
29, 2001 at 2 pm Pacific time:

Structure of interim funding.

As Michael Lubic suggested, the interim funding should be structured as DIP
financing from the settlement reserve account to the CalPX, with repayment,
if any, to come from any excess funds available from whatever source there
may be at the CalPX, after all other obligations are satisfied in accordance
with the Plan.  Of course, there may not be any other source of funds, but
we should make sure that if there are recoveries on the bond or
commandeering litigation, or anything else for that matter, those recoveries
are used first to replenish the settlement reserve account for funds
advanced for interim funding.  It should be pointed out that the recoveries
on the bond or commandeering litigation may belong to the settlement reserve
account in any event, but this structure will ensure that if there are any
disputes over that, at least the amounts advanced will be repaid.  It should
also be pointed out that the advance from the settlement reserve account has
no effect on and does not make any determination of the allocation of the
funds in the settlement reserve account or the parties entitled to such
funds.  That is not being addressed by the interim funding.

Therefore, the interim funding will be accomplished through a motion for
approval of the DIP financing under section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, on
notice to all participants and ISO scheduling coordinators, creditors, etc.

Any amount of the interim funding that is not utilized as of the effective
date of the Plan (estimated for Feb or March 2002), will be used first to
establish the reserves described in the Plan.

Amount of interim funding.

As indicated on the attachment to this email, the amount that needs to be
reserved is $10.2 million, with the understanding that every effort will be
made to economize on all operating and legal expenses so that the amounts
actually incurred and spent will be significantly less than the interim
funding reserve.  This is not the actual budget, which will be substantially
lower than the reserve, but rather is a set aside to ensure that if the
funds at the CalPX, including those in the settlement reserve account are
actually disbursed, there will be sufficient funds to cover all expenses.

It should be noted that the $10 million operating reserve the Committee
agreed to in the proposed Plan can be reduced by $2.5 million to $7.5
million to account for the fact that the $10.2 million interim funding
reserve includes about $2.5 million of expenses that were also in the Plan's
$10 million reserve.  Similarly, the $7.8 million reserve proposed for the
bond and commandeering litigation can be reduced by $1 million because that
budget includes about $1 million of expenses that will be included in the
interim funding reserve.

The $10.2 million of interim funding will actually come from the interest
that is earned on the settlement reserve account from October 2001 through
March 2002, approximately $6.3 million (estimated at about $900,000 a
month), plus $3.9 million of the approximately $7 million in interest that
was earned on the settlement reserve account prior to from March to October
2001.

Total reserves.

Again, it should be emphasized that the proposed reserves are not budgets.
The reserves are intended to be safety nets that account for ""worst case""
delays and expenses and that will allow for the distribution of funds on
hand in excess of the reserves as soon as possible (when a court or FERC
allows) without the concern that the parties that receive the distributions
may be asked to put additional funds back in to fund additional expenses.
The actual budgets that should be  acheived, if not exceeded, are the ""best
case"" scenarios that we have discussed during our Committee calls.  We
expect to operate under that ""best case"" scenario once the Plan is
confirmed, and the sooner the Committee selects a new manager that can start
the transition process, the sooner we should be able to influence a
reduction in expenses at the CalPX even before the Plan becomes effective.
Until that occurs, the CalPX continues to operate at the level we are
seeking to reduce.

However, the total ""worst case"" reserves would consist of the following:

Interim funding through March 31, 2001				$10.2 million
Plan operating reserve through December 31, 2004		$  7.5 million
Plan litigation reserve through December 31, 2004		$  6.8 million
Total									$24.5 million

This is far better than the $30 million to $40 million that the PX was
proposing.

Please be prepared to resolve these funding issues at our meeting on
November 29, 2001.  Thanks.

"In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters;","
	Steve and Jim,

	This will confirm our meeting today about pushing forward on the above-referenced claim, especially in light of the pending statute of limitations for a direct tort action against Baytank, which expires on or about November 4.

	1.  Becky will finalize the statement of claim per the suggestions made at the meeting and then send a final version to Ted Rosen of Wortham's, Jim, and Steve.

	2.  Jim authorized Ted Rosen to go forward with contacting Sharron West and getting that claim resolved without Jim being present, given that Jim has out-of-the office business committments for until early November.

	3.  Ted will both present our insurance claim to Underwriters and do his best to discourage any action against Baytank (given that Enron has a very low probability of getting anything out a subrogation action) and Philchem (who Underwriters shouldn't be able to recover against anyway, given the implied waiver of subrogation in the Enron/Philchem contract).

	4.  Solely in order to protect ourselves against a claim from Underwriters that our recovery against them should be reduced because we did not protect the applicable statute of limitations against potential third-party claimaints, I am today attempting to contact Baytank's general counsel to see if I can get a three-month extension of time from them for a third-party against Baytank.  Given that we are not sure exactly when the product contamination that was discovered on or about November 4, 1999 occurred, but only that it occurred after October 28 (per my notes of an earlier conversation with Steve), I think we need to file a third-party lawsuit against Baytank no later than Friday, October 26 (since October 28 is on a Sunday) and then promptly serve it.  Parenthetically, our action againt Philchem shouldn't be time-barred for four years (we have a breach of contract action against them), so we shouldn't have to get an extension of time from them.

	5.   Attached is the proposed third-party action against Baytank if we can't get an agreed extension of time for filing it from Baytank.  I need Steve to closely review for factual accuracy.  I have tried to leave it as general as possible.  We don't need to provide a dollar amount of our damages at this time.

	Britt

	P.S. to Richard:  Do you want me to do the GC memo on this if I don't get an agreed extension of time from Baytank ?

"RE: service of process/ Keiffer Request for Insurance Info","Gail,

Eileen is out of the office today; however, I have confirmed that Rob Cole of Corporate Risk Management is handling this matter directly with the insurance carrier, Travelers.  Risk Management is not, at this time, retaining the Litigation Unit to assist with the claim.  It is my understanding that an acknowledgement letter has been sent in response to the Keiffer letter and Rob Cole is working with NEPCO's safety director, Tony Blair-Softich, to obtain additional necessary information.  

Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.

Eileen,
	I have reviewed the letter and, to the extent that this involves a personal injury/insurance issue, It sounds like it falls  within your area of responsibility.  Please confirm that this is correct and that your group will work with David and the folks at NEPCO to sort out what needs to be done to respond. It may be that the subject coverage is with NEPCO and there won't be much if anything for you to do.
	David, please confirm that you have received the referenced letter, let me know whether you have information about this fellow sufficient to identify the insurance information requested, and also let me know if I can do anything to assist.  
	Thanks.

Michelle/Gail -

Richard has budgeted to cross-charge about $677k to EGAS.  $257k is internal time (presumably you two although help me to confirm).  There is also $420k budgeted for external time.  I don't know what that amount constitutes.

Can you help me with these amounts?

This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
 
The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

"American Heart Walk","Friends:

This Saturday, November 3, I am participating in the American Heart Walk, a 5k and 10k walk that raises money for the American Heart Association.  I am sure that all of you are very familiar with the fine work of this organization, but if you are not, here is its website:  http://www.americanheart.org/.  Moreover, most of you are likely familiar with my particular interest in heart related charities.

I am looking for sponsors and would be very grateful if you could make a donation.  Please let know as soon as possible if you can help, since I would like to collect most of the donations prior to Saturday.  Also, for you Enron types, don't forget about the Matching Gift Fund.

Thank you very much for your support.

"In re Doyle Claim Against Underwriters","
	I recently heard from David Marshall in the Risk Management Group that we may have made or were contemplating a claim against Ron Anderson of IBC Turbo for misrepresenting the quality of the gas turbines that he procured for us.  Marshall said that you were the person who would know.  

	Anderson is a potentially crucial witness for us if we decide to pursue Underwriters on the insurance claim arising out of the failure of the Doyle Unit #1, which is one of the gas turbines that he procured for us and that was located in Monroe, Georgia at the Doyle plant.

	Are you the man I need to talk to?  I know you are underwater.  Is there anyone else who would know about this?

"RE: ENA v. Adkins","Wade Price should be able help you out on item #1.

I never was really assigned to ""audit"" the Appalachian suppliers.  I was midway through another Appalachian project , when I realized that there were several transport and purchase related issues.  So, I began compiling a Supplier Reference Book to get a better picture of supplier's activity.  I used this book to verify price change request.  I also used it to identify several incorrect requests for pricing adjustments and errors in Settlements' calc-sheets.  My concern for additional purchase errors led me to the review most of the Appalachian purchase deals.  It was during one of these activities that I identified the Adkin's payment errors.  I'm sorry, but I don't have any documented ""audit"" findings.  Any correspondence I did have was lost in the conversion to Outlook.  I do still maintain my Supplier Reference Book, but I don't think it would be much help.  However, I did review the CGAS IF pricing the for the year prior to the deal.  Only one month during that time was the index price higher than the contracted $3.075.  In fact they were considerably lower.  Also, I've reviewed the settlement statements, it appears we paid Mr. Adkins for three months before the error was caught.  The first month was paid at index (index was $0.06 lower than the contract price), the next month was paid at index ( index was $0.22 higher than contract price) and the third month was corrected to the $3.075 ( index was $4.53).   I think this correction made in Oct-00, is when he first realized there was an issue.  I hope this helps you,  Terry 3-7675.

Subject:	ENA v. Adkins


	Stacy,

	This will confirm our telephone conference with Mike Farrell, Franklin Adkins' attorney, today.  Based on my recommendation, you and I followed up with him today to see if Adkins still wanted to pursue his claim, despite our response to him.

	Farrell told us that although his client had not yet received his written legal analysis, Adkins does not want to drop the claim.  Farrell told you and me that he thought the ""mere sending of your confirm"" did not overweigh the months that ENA paid Adkins under the index price, which established in Farrell's view a course of dealing between the parties that made the index price the correct price.  During this short telephone conference, Farrell never said whether his client had received the confirmation.  Of course, our position is that whether Adkins' telefax machine printed out the confirmation is irrelevant; we have the evidence necessary to show that we sent it.

	Farrell told us that he expected to send us a response next week, continuing his demand for arbitration.  He did not say whether there would be any settlement offer in the letter.  I will advise you as soon as I receive Farrell's letter.

	I would be very pleased to arbitrate this for you as your trial counsel.  I believe that Farrell is correct in stating that there are sufficient facts to create a course of performance issue, on which arbitrators could rule in favor of Adkins.  However, I believe that we have a persuasive argument that ENA paid the incorrect price only as a result of a clerical error.  In order to support this argument, we also need to develop the following: 

	1.  Did Franklin Adkins do or not do anything as the result of receipt of payment of the index price for a period of time that disadvantaged him?   The timing of when Adkins first realized he was being paid the index price may be critical.  I need to speak to the right person about how we would have made payment and what business documents were sent to Adkins after the confirm was telefaxed, and get copies of all those documents.  Could someone tell me who that would be?  

	2.  Did ENA correct the price before or after the spot market price rose above the contract price? (You had kindly agreed to do the homework on this).  Also, I need Mary to advise me when she was instructed to perform the internal audit, why and by whom, and get copies from her of all her file material on that audit.

	I greatly appreciate your and everyone else's help.  If anyone has any thoughts on other homework we could or need to be doing, please let me know.  If anyone knows of someone else who needs to be in the loop on this, please let me know.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

"RE: GT11 Incident Discussions at Cuiaba 9 & 10 Oct 01","Will the madness never end?   We go through this on every claim.  I don't know why our insurance guys cannot get on Enron's side to get as much paid for as possible.  Let there be no mistake--Enron Risk Management has a long held disdain for lawyers gettin involved to examine their policies.  I don't doubt for a minute Stuart was preconditioed on this one.  Eddy & I are meeting with Jim Bouillion today and we'll see what we can do.  I agree with Eddy that if they pay the big stuff, we need to be careful. I'm pissed but don't worry--I'll be charming and nice as long as I have to be.  There are definitely a list of things that should be covered, although I agree examination of the policy for coverage probably is not.  But Gordon and Jack's work on that was limited and most of their advice has been related to the Siemens issues, mitigation of damages, conduct as the prudent uninsured, and questions as to how to address these issues under Brazilian law which governs the policy.  The correspondence, the POs, agreements etc should be covered.

They have no right to refuse to pay legal costs -- especially for the Brazilian & US counsel used to paper the deal with Siemens.  Much of Gordon and Jack's work can be characterized as necessary to analyze Siemens claims in connection with their bargaining position.  Certainly Cliffs work on the agreements shoudl eb covered.  

If they promptly pay the big claims, we may not want to push this.  But we shouldn't give it up just yet.

Folks -

	Further to John's comments Stuart's body language and general comments left no doubt that he would not agree to pay for legal costs outside of the very narrow range described below.  In fact he once again questioned why we had engaged counsel at all.  Let's not kid ourselves - getting insurance to pay for legal costs is like having a 50 foot putt on a green at Augusta.

Subject:	RE: GT11 Incident Discussions at Cuiaba 9 & 10 Oct 01

Gordon,

Stuart did not elaborate on the legal support issue, other than to say that any work would have to be preapproved by him and that the only possible role that he could see would be related to subrogation issues.  He seemed leary of outside attorney involvement and questioned why we might want lawyers involved in the claim (other than the administrative issues related to agreement preparation). 

During our discussions, he did state that the underwriters would settle the claim with us and that they would figure out how to deal with Siemens.

I have never read the policy (nor do I intend to), but Stuart is working toward getting advanced payments for us. The underwriters in London seem to be cooperating on this issue. For the amount that we are looking at, $21 MM, the underwriters would have to get their board approval.  If they agree to do advanced payments (and we hope that they do), it does not matter what the policy says on this issue. He was, however, pleased to hear that we were looking at an interim financing structure with an Enron company paying. He said that this approach would make it easier to get the funds approved with the underwriters (no board approval required).

John

John- This looks like great progress.  Two questions.  There is some mention
of legal fees being limited to ""subrogation"" issues.  Can you elaborate?
What are such issues? We know what subrogation is.  Does this mean work to
preserve the subrogation position of the insurer is allowed?  If Siemens is
named as an additional insured, insurers would have no such rights.  This,
of course, would depend on their reading of the cover- i.e. if they might
say that this had nothing to do with gas commissioning.  We, of course, are
supposed to have covered Siemens with a ""maintenance cover"" which would have
protected them for design defects etc.  Need to figure out what Stuart is
getting at.  

We had understood that any work done to facilitate the repair would also be
covered, such as work on the Change Order, Parts Agreement, etc..  We are
about to send out our bill and would like to do two separate bills- one
which would cover things which the insurer might reimburse, and one which is
clearly advice to you on issues like the PPA, etc. Let us know ASAP so we
can work up something. 

Second, there is discussion of ""advance payment"".  Jim Studdert's recent
e-mail said that this policy is an ""indemnity"" policy which he describes as
a ""pay if paid"" approach.    That is, EPE would have to have spent the money
already in order to get paid by insurers, rather than be paid against an
estimate of cost, or against a PO being issued. That is in fact how most of
the language is phrased, but there are provisions which could be read the
other way too. Did Stuart get into that issue?  

Thanks   Gordon

Stuart,

I would like to take this opportunity to summarize the discussions that we
have had over the last two days in Cuiaba.

Payment of Insurance Proceeds
?    Payments from the London underwriters will flow to the IRB
?  Payments made by the IRB to EPE direct will be in Reais; the claim is
   dollar based and will be converted from dollars to reais at the exchange
   rate at the time of payment [S. Stromeyer to determine if IRB can pay
   directly to EPE in dollars]
?  Payments can be made to third parties outside of Brazil in dollars at
   EPE's direction [S. Stromeyer to check with IRB to determine if this is
   accepted by Central Bank]

Siemens Meeting Last Week in Erlangen
   Root Cause
?    To prevent coking problems from occurring in the fuel nozzles, Siemens
increased the volume of purge water used to purge fuel oil from the burner
fuel lines following a trip from premix.
   ? The increased volume of purge water resulted in quenching of Row 3
     blades.
   ? The quenching produced high thermo-mechanical forces on the blades
     which produced cracks.
   ? One of the blade cracks eventually resulted in a blade failure.
   ? A meeting is scheduled for 30 October in London for Siemens to explain
     their conclusions on root cause.
   Commercial Issues
?    Parts will be purchased in accordance with the Spare Parts Agreement
(SPA) with the following significant exceptions:
?    A 30% expediting fee will be paid on turbine blades and vanes
     ?  Prices are FOB port of export with Siemens listed prices
     ?  The SPA 20% discount will not apply
     ?  Payment must be made prior to shipment
?    There will be two services agreements:
?    1) between EPE and Siemens Ltda for Brazilian sourced services, paid
in Reais at the rates in Siemens Price List 1725 (provided to you in
Cuiaba), converted to Reais using 2.7315 Real/US$ and
     ?  2) between EPE and Siemens AG for non-Brazilian sourced services,
        paid in US$.
     ?  These agreements will incorporate terms from the Siemens Selling
        Policies / Price Lists and the EPC Contract.
     ?  Late payments will incur interest at 14%

Advanced Payment
?    Property damage coverage advanced payments could be made at 100% of
estimated value
?  Advanced payment will not be made against BI coverage
?  Typical total time for advanced payment is about 30 days
?  Once IRB receives funds from London underwriters, typical payment time
   is about 5 or so days
?  Munich Re will require a Board Meeting to approve an advanced payment of
   the size being discussed.
?  If the parts costs are financed by third party, it will be quicker to
   get Munich Re payment. Could know funding date by 22 October

BI
?    London underwriters pay on lost revenue
?  IRB traditionally pays on turnover or lost net profit. S. Stromeyer and
   Crowford-Resin personnel will discuss with IRB to try to convince them
   to pay on lost revenues. A meeting is scheduled for 5 November.
?  IRB will not likely allow direct payment to third parties outside of
   Brazil.
?  A meeting is scheduled in Houston on Tuesday, 16 October to discuss BI
   estimate

Property Damage
?    Duties and taxes are included in coverage
?  FX transaction costs are not included in coverage
?  Legal and engineering support are covered only with prior approval of
   appropriate justification. Approval of legal is usually limited to
   subrogation issues.
?  A rough estimate of insurable costs was provided by EPE and discussed
   (the estimate was qualified by footnotes and by the discussion). The
   purpose of this estimate was to provide information to obtain advanced
   payment.  Total insurance portion of parts, expediting fee, repairs,
   services, taxes and less deductible was $23.3 MM. Total EPE portion was
   $6.3 MM. As discussed, it is possible that the insurable portion may
   increase pending analysis of additional components. We agreed that the
   amount to be used for advanced payment consideration for parts is $21.1
   MM (Parts Total less Repairs less Deductible).

Documentation
?    The following documents were provided to S. Stromeyer:
?    From Siemens:
?    SI/EE-2234, dated 08/30/01
     ?  SI/EE-2235, dated 09/03/01
     ?  SI/EE-2236, dated 09/05/01
     ?  SI/EE-2237, dated 09/05/01
     ?  SI/EE-2238, dated 09/11/01
     ?  SI/EE-2240, dated 09/19/01
     ?  SI/EE-2241, dated 09/21/01
     ?  SI/EE-2242, dated 09/25/01
     ?  SI/EE-2243, dated 09/25/01
     ?  SI/EE-2245, dated 09/28/01
     ?  SI/EE-2246, dated 10/02/01
?    From J. Guidry to Siemens:
?    09/07/01
     ?  09/10/01
     ?  09/19/01
     ?  09/23/01
     ?  09/26/01
?    Purchase Order from EPE to Siemens 09/13/01
   ? Letter from Dan Shultz to G. Hartmann  09/21/01

We are moving forward with preparations for returning GT11 to service,
based on these discussions. If you have any comments on this summary, let
me know as soon as possible.

John

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Subject:	Draft Deerfield LLC Water Agreement  Privileged and Confidential

Dear Paul,

As I mentioned during our earlier discussions one of the projects that Enron has been working on is a potential power plant/site in Deerfield, FL.  There are alot of unknowns on whether this project in the current environment with respect to energy development in Florida and Enron in particular will go forward.  We will probably know more toward the end of the year. 

As part of the process, if it goes forward, we will be a need to obtain a Water Agreement.  I believe there may have been some preliminary discussions months ago with the County concerning water requirements but nothing has occurred recently. At this time our folks do not want to talk with County about it for some reason. 

However, assuming that we might need a water agreement at sometime and probably on short notice, I decided at least to prepare a draft and thus be in position to talk with the County when and if the discussions ever to proceed.  The commercial provisions are not finalized yet but the draft contains what I think our folks may need.  

I would appreciate your reviewing this draft and providing me your thoughts and any suggested changes.  I will call you next week to discuss this in more detail.  From a strategy standpoint we are not in position at this time to talk with the County or to let them know we may be preparing a draft.

Have a great weekend.

Thanks for your help.

Randy

Gail,

Eileen is out of the office today; however, I have confirmed that Rob Cole of Corporate Risk Management is handling this matter directly with the insurance carrier, Travelers.  Risk Management is not, at this time, retaining the Litigation Unit to assist with the claim.  It is my understanding that an acknowledgement letter has been sent in response to the Keiffer letter and Rob Cole is working with NEPCO's safety director, Tony Blair-Softich, to obtain additional necessary information.  

Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.

	I have reviewed the letter and, to the extent that this involves a personal injury/insurance issue, It sounds like it falls  within your area of responsibility.  Please confirm that this is correct and that your group will work with David and the folks at NEPCO to sort out what needs to be done to respond. It may be that the subject coverage is with NEPCO and there won't be much if anything for you to do.

"ENA v. Adkins","
	Stacy,

	This will confirm our telephone conference with Mike Farrell, Franklin Adkins' attorney, today.  Based on my recommendation, you and I followed up with him today to see if Adkins still wanted to pursue his claim, despite our response to him.

	Farrell told us that although his client had not yet received his written legal analysis, Adkins does not want to drop the claim.  Farrell told you and me that he thought the ""mere sending of your confirm"" did not overweigh the months that ENA paid Adkins under the index price, which established in Farrell's view a course of dealing between the parties that made the index price the correct price.  During this short telephone conference, Farrell never said whether his client had received the confirmation.  Of course, our position is that whether Adkins' telefax machine printed out the confirmation is irrelevant; we have the evidence necessary to show that we sent it.

	Farrell told us that he expected to send us a response next week, continuing his demand for arbitration.  He did not say whether there would be any settlement offer in the letter.  I will advise you as soon as I receive Farrell's letter.

	I would be very pleased to arbitrate this for you as your trial counsel.  I believe that Farrell is correct in stating that there are sufficient facts to create a course of performance issue, on which arbitrators could rule in favor of Adkins.  However, I believe that we have a persuasive argument that ENA paid the incorrect price only as a result of a clerical error.  In order to support this argument, we also need to develop the following: 

	1.  Did Franklin Adkins do or not do anything as the result of receipt of payment of the index price for a period of time that disadvantaged him?   The timing of when Adkins first realized he was being paid the index price may be critical.  I need to speak to the right person about how we would have made payment and what business documents were sent to Adkins after the confirm was telefaxed, and get copies of all those documents.  Could someone tell me who that would be?  

	2.  Did ENA correct the price before or after the spot market price rose above the contract price? (You had kindly agreed to do the homework on this).  Also, I need Mary to advise me when she was instructed to perform the internal audit, why and by whom, and get copies from her of all her file material on that audit.

	I greatly appreciate your and everyone else's help.  If anyone has any thoughts on other homework we could or need to be doing, please let me know.  If anyone knows of someone else who needs to be in the loop on this, please let me know.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

"In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters","
	Steve,

	This will  confirm my and Richard's conference with you regarding going-forward strategy in this matter.   Again, we recommend that we make the best case we can against Underwriters immediately, but do not recommend filing suit against Philchem or Baytank unless absolutely necessary to protect a statute of limitations prior to finalizing a settlement with Underwriters.  Given the contract language, we just don't see that we are going to increase our recovery by filing suit against either Philchem or Baytank.  There is a statute of limitations for a tort action against Baytank coming up November 1.  You and I will be speaking with your supervisor tomorrow morning, and assuming that he agrees, I will immediately liaise with Jim about presenting the documents to Sharron West that she previously requested.

"securities fraud lawsuits","Here is a new press release that was issued this morning by the Cauley Geller firm:   http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/011023/cltu023_1.html

The Cauley Geller firm and Milberg Weiss are co-counsel.  As these press releases come out, it is important to remember that many counsel usually sign up on one case.  Therefore, the number of press releases does not equal the number of cases filed.

As an aside,  Dave Sharp called me this morning to chat.  He mentioned that he received ""five or six"" calls last week from counsel interested in filing securities fraud actions against Enron.  Needless to say, he deferred.

Also, Murray Fogler called.  He said that Tom Cunningham called him on another case and mentioned that he had just filed a 10b-5 case and a deriviative case against Enron.  Apparently, Cunningham is trying to get involved in some bigger cases.

The fun is on.

You all are in our thoughts and prayers. It does not seem possible that Houston's flagship company and premier corporate citizen could get struck by lightning. If it happens to you all, it could happen to anybody. I have been following the situation daily because I have been representing Tyco in a revision of their existing contract with EESO. It has not been pretty.

As you know, I have twice volunteered our firm's assistance to Enron in anyway we could be of help. I took the lack of response to mean you had all the help you needed. We have been approached by a couple of clients to advise them and to represent them if there appears no solution to Enron's problems short of protection of the bankruptcy court. Do you have an objection to our representation of them? I will assume that you have none if I do not hear from you to the contrary.

 I was shocked to see that there was a file on me.
 Do not use your Social Security Number. Just check your state, and put in

 the search.
 You will get the case number, date of investigation and any photos on

 It's a free site, but is expected to be closed due to a federal court

"GMAT Review available at Enron","
GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Roberto-

I spoke with Andrew and he was going to call you to okay this request.  What we have is 3 Compaq Desk Pros hard drives, 1 Compaq Armada M300 laptop and 1 IBM Think Pad 600E.  We do not have any monitors, mouses, keyboards, printers, network connections, power connections, id's or passwords.  We need to be able to power these up, review files on their hard drives as well as their h: drives (Andy Fastow, Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant) and print files from the computers.  We have all of the equipment set up in conference room 3321 and would like to get started as soon as possible.  I know you are very busy right now so let me know if there is anything we can do to help.  Thanks.

Mary

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Peter Mims called this a.m.. He reviewed the documents we sent yesterday and seemed pleased.  We wants more detail on the specific section pertaining to ""clearing"" of orders. 

I spoke with Leonardo Pacheco who suggested we meet with Kevin Montagne (he reports directly to Jay Webb and is the Sr. Director in charge of IT E-Commerce.)

I've left a voice mail to get on his calendar on Monday for a meeting with Peter and Bill.  Do you want to attend if I get time with him?

Thanks.

"FW: Enron Petrochemicals v. Baytank","     Steve,

      1.  With apologies, attached is the redrafted petition, removing the ""excessive heat"" allegation.

       2.  You told me that the only way to perhaps determine if other Baytank entities were involved was to ask Philchem, who might or might not know, and who would then be asking questions about what we were going to do next.

       Britt

	 

     P.S. to Richard:  I haven't heard back from Baytank's president, even though I left a voice-mail and sent an e-mail, which was shown on my e-mail receipts as having been read on Tuesday of this week.  In the e-mail, I specifically said that we may be filing suit this week if we didn't get an extension.

	For the sake of caution, I think we need to file suit Friday afternoon, for reasons I've mentioned previously.  Shouldn't I send out a GC memo now?

Subject:	Enron Petrochemicals v. Baytank


	Steve,

	Per your advice, I have removed the ""excessive heat"" allegation in the petition.  How does it look to you now?

	Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  You confirmed that while we know for sure that the contamination didn't occur prior to October 28, and that it was discovered on or about November 4, we don't know for an absolute certainty that it didn't occur, say, on October 29, 1999.  Accordingly, if Baytank won't grant us an extension of time to file suit against it (and you, Richard and Jim were bcc'd on the e-mail I just sent to the president of some Baytank entity asking for such an extension), then I want to be ready to file this suit on Friday.

	A related point:  I have included the name of the Baytank entity with whom Philchem executed the Marketing Agreement, which is the only Baytank corporate entity that I know of that had some responsibility for the contamination.  However, the Marketing Agreement does not say whether that Baytank entity owns, leases or operates the facilities in question.  It would be preferable to name any and all Baytank entites that own, lease or operate the facility in question.  Short of calling Baytank and asking, do you know how we could find this out very quickly?

	Many thanks.

	Britt

	P.S.:  Richard,  should I go ahead and send out a GC memo on this suit, in case Baytank doesn't promptly respond to my request for an extension of time?

Team Sun & Ski will have a booth at the event.  Please come and visit us.  You can register, ask questions, or just say hi.  I know you have lots of questions about the new team, and this will be your chance to meet those individuals from Sun & Ski Sports who have made it possible for our team to stay together this year.  

We will have some trainers available, and would like some volunteers to do some stationary riding in the area of our booth.  If you'd like to do this, please come equipped.  We'll probably have some bikes also, but if you could throw your own in, that would be helpful.  You can get a free safety check-up on your current bike, or shop for a new bike or the latest cycling gear.  Official MS150 Health Clubs will be on hand to give training tips and advice.

I'm looking forward to seeing you there!

"RE: service of process/ Keiffer Request for Insurance Info","Eileen,
	I have reviewed the letter and, to the extent that this involves a personal injury/insurance issue, It sounds like it falls  within your area of responsibility.  Please confirm that this is correct and that your group will work with David and the folks at NEPCO to sort out what needs to be done to respond. It may be that the subject coverage is with NEPCO and there won't be much if anything for you to do.
	David, please confirm that you have received the referenced letter, let me know whether you have information about this fellow sufficient to identify the insurance information requested, and also let me know if I can do anything to assist.

"FW: Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)","
Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.

Cliff, Roberta, and I were extremely impressed with Judge de Pena's apparent familiarity with the motion and some of the summary judgment evidence.  He was also extremely attentive throughout the hearing and promised that he would have a decision for us within the next few days.  Both Mitchell Clark and Bill Edwards were at the hearing and both argued portions of the plaintiffs' response and motion to strike.  If we do not receive the court's ruling next week, I would like to schedule a team meeting for December 4 to discuss what needs to be done in preparation for trial.  Melinda, please set it up.

"New York Counsel","I am concerned about your leisurely work habits after getting a 3:15 a.m. voicemail today ( recognizing it was 2 hours later in Houston). I wanted to follow up on the conversation we had on the flight to Portland about the difficulty of finding satisfactory counsel in New York for that IP litigation. Recognizing you have a million things on your plate, I pass this on to consider when you get to it. I would recommend you contact Jim Benedict of Clifford Chance Rogers & Wells. He was the lead defense counsel in my class action against Merrill Lynch, so my only dealings were as an adversary for over 4 years, first in San Diego and then in New Jersey. Unlike many of the NY attorneys I have encountered, Jim has actually been in trial and does well, i.e.,is comfortable in a courtroom. I still know his number 212-878-8274, which is a sign of too many calls. If any of your new securities class actions are in the NY area, or you are doing interviews for counsel anywhere, he would do a good job for you. I suspect he would go into shock if he knew I was on the defense side now.

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"More information re the claim of Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. against EES","Vicki, a few weeks ago a friend of mine, Steve Greenwald (a partner in Davis Wright Tremaine's San Francisco office), called to tell me that one of his clients, Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc., had entered into an agreement with an Enron entity, and was claiming that Enron had breached that agreement.  This client is allegedly preparing to file a petition against us.  Steve told his client that DWT could not represent Texas-Ohio in litigation against Enron, and Steve asked me to try to find out what agreement his client might be talking about (at that time, Steve did not have a copy of the agreement).  Steve asked his client to produce the agreement, and at the same we checked throughout Enron for the agreement (Vicki, you checked around and couldn't find any agreement between EES and Texas-Ohio).  We weren't even sure which Enron entity was involved.  We did kick around my proposal that Steve might be able to serve as a mediator between Texas-Ohio and Enron, to attempt to settle the dispute without litigation.

Now we have the agreement, and it is with EES.  I will send it to you when I get a good-quality copy (which is being sent to me today).  From my almost-illegible faxed copy, It is a Client Commission Agreement between EES and Texas-Ohio, Inc., dated October 13, 2000.  Timonthy J. Hamilton signed as Attorney-in-Fact for EES; there are no lawyers' initials on the execution block.  Texas-Ohio is entitled to recommend to EES prospective commercial and industrial customers served by SoCal, SDG&E, SWG (Southwest Gas), and PG&E.  If EES enters into an agreement with any such identified customers, Texas-Ohio earns a commission.  There are provisions concerning price quoting and commission calculation; I'm sure you are familiar with those.

I am not familiar with this agreement or the extent of its use, and I do not yet know the nature of Texas-Ohio's claim, although I would suspect it is for non-payment of commissions allegedly due.  I will forward the agreement to you, and I'll stand by to help on this, should you want me to.   And Steve Greenwald would be happy to try to broker a peace, if that offer becomes attractive (I'd be happy to introduce you to him, or to work with him, as you wish).

Sheila, this is FYI so that you'll know what's happened on this matter.  It's been a while since we discussed it.  Richard, this is FYI also, inasmuch as this could lead to litigation.

Thank you, 

Kenton

"PX--getting collateral back-important","bob, would like to be aggressive re this and push for way to get this money back. we have $150 million tied up which we need .we have ferc issues/injunction to consider as well.

Subject:	Duke motion

I've looked at the Duke motion.  It's an interesting approach but I think technically wrong on procedure.  Actions to reclaim property in possession of a debtor are by adversary proceeding initiated by complaint, not by motion.  If we're inclined to follow suit, we should file a turnover complaint and follow it up with a motion for summary judgment.  All that will take ninety days or so.  That's about the same timing as for confirmation of our plan pursuant to which turnover will be effected.

"further report","by now you should all have by fax the dismissals filed today in the schultes case, including the gift to us of a dismissal of the contract counts (1-4) against the enron entities as well!  i spoke with counsel for sdi, who - despite confidentiality restrictions - confirmed my instinct that the defendants were concerned that they could be brought back in if the contract claims still existed against us.  i have to think harder as to whether they're really off the hook on the tort counts, but it's at least reassuring they thought so.

interesting as well, the defendants apparently urged the plaintiff to just dismiss us. his lawyer apparently rejected the suggestion with the explanation that we could pay too.  they responded ""for what""? and apparently the plaintiff's counsel just repeated the same response.  if it offers any comfort, sdi's lawyer can't imagine any case schultes has to proceed against us on.

i asked why we hadn't been broached to join in, and the only explanation i got - which didn't seem really to be enough of an answer - was that this was just part of a bigger settlement of the securities cases.  for our info, have there been such settlements?

the ""big"" strategic question now is do we just wait to hear from the court or plaintiff's counsel, or do we push for a hearing.  thoughts?

"RE: Subrogation","In short, if the carrier pays out anything, they hold subrogation rights; however, the longer answer is much more complicated, of course. Please feel free to call Eileen (37535) or me and we will be glad to discuss further.

If the carrier pays to settle the case on behalf of the directors or officers does it thereby gain any subrogation rights against any third parties.  For example, would it mean the carrier, and not the company, would own the cause of action against AA?

"CALIFORNIA REFUND PROCEEDING STAYED INDEFINITELY","FERC issued an order this morning staying indefinitely the California Refund proceeding.  In its order (attached), FERC notes that many requests for rehearing are pending and FERC intends to act on those requests soon.  FERC states that if it were to grant rehearing, it could affect the refund calculations being determined in the hearing proceeding, so FERC is staying the hearing proceeding until further order from the Commission.

While we don't know what FERC will say on hearing, it is very likely that the rehearing order will be a significant departure from the July 25 order.  We will let you know of any further developments.  If you have any questions, please let me know (202) 466-9160.

"RE: Crescendo","Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investment done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in Utah and Colorado..............the ""Crescendo entity"" is managed by non-Enron personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears that Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine the relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and Sullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM............Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Josey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Gail,

Eileen is out of the office today; however, I have confirmed that Rob Cole of Corporate Risk Management is handling this matter directly with the insurance carrier, Travelers.  Risk Management is not, at this time, retaining the Litigation Unit to assist with the claim.  It is my understanding that an acknowledgement letter has been sent in response to the Keiffer letter and Rob Cole is working with NEPCO's safety director, Tony Blair-Softich, to obtain additional necessary information.  

Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.

	I have reviewed the letter and, to the extent that this involves a personal injury/insurance issue, It sounds like it falls  within your area of responsibility.  Please confirm that this is correct and that your group will work with David and the folks at NEPCO to sort out what needs to be done to respond. It may be that the subject coverage is with NEPCO and there won't be much if anything for you to do.
	David, please confirm that you have received the referenced letter, let me know whether you have information about this fellow sufficient to identify the insurance information requested, and also let me know if I can do anything to assist.

These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

As I have been unable to reach you to discuss this project, I did want you to know that I plan on being out of the office for the remainder of this week  and all of next week on vacation.  However, as I understand this may be a time sensitive project, I can be flexible and be in Monday through Wednesday of next week if it is necessary and if I know ahead of time.  Thursday & Friday I already have family commitments.  If you have a general idea of when this project will begin, please leave me a phone message as I will be checking my voicemail on a regular basis.  If I do not hear from you in the meantime, I will check with you upon my return to the office on Monday, Dec. 3rd.  I look forward to working with you.

"In re M/V INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE/In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters/FW: Ocean Cargo Claims","We have extensions of time to file suit against Underwriters in both the above-referenced matters that expire at the end of December.  I would suggest a three-month extension of time to file suit in both, given the present circumstances.  That does not mean, of course, that we can't file earlier than that.

Please let me know.

Subject: Ocean Cargo Claims


David / Britt:

Further to our telephone conversation this afternoon, I spoke to Sharron West about extensions of suit time.  Sharron is very sympathetic to the situation.  She has requested from Britt a letter with a listing of the claims for which Enron is requesting that underwriters grant an extension.  

Sharron agrees that on-going claims such as the INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE are not prejudiced by any bankruptcy proceedings.  The only issue really is to whom any claim proceeds would be paid.  If there is a trustee, I assume that the claim would be paid to the trustee.

Regards,


Ted Rosen

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting?    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed  a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale  provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys.,  Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d  1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two  prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,  Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998).    In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings  and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention  is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff  test, the Federal Circuit held that a software invention was ready  for patenting when one of the inventors described the invention  to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it,  even though the actual software used to practice the invention  did not exist before the on-sale bar date.    The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature  of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates  the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect  high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with  software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales  materials that could describe details of software inventions must  now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under  ?102(b).

"RSM v. El Paso","
	I just participated in a joint defense conference call with in-house and outside counsel in this matter.  I was not given notice of the call until a moment or two before it occurred.  We plan to have another such call next Thursday, at the same time.  In a nutshell, 

	1.  All the defendants want to retain our outside counsel (Lazaro Garza-Gongora) as their outside counsel.  I told them that I had no problem with that so long as, in the event of a conflict, which I did not anticipate, my clients got to keep him.  Of course, I am assuming that his fees and expenses would be apportioned among us.  No one seemed to have a problem with that, but I need to follow it up in writing.  I also anticipate a joint defense agreement.

	2. The answer date for Enron Corp. and Intratex (Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. has not to our knowledge been served) is Monday, November 5.  Although Lazaro hasn't called me back yet about his review of the Court's file, which he told me last week he would do, the attorneys on the conference call reportedly represented all the named defendants, and no one had an earlier answer date.

	3. I was asked to ask Lazaro to ask for an extension of time on behalf of all the defendants until and including December 5 to move, answer or otherwise plead.  I have a call in to Lazaro to discuss that approach.  Query whether we want to agree to respond at the same time on behalf of EGM if EGM hasn't been served.

	4.  During the conference call, a number of factual, legal and strategy issues were discussed.  Foremost among them was getting this case dismissed before merits discovery commenced.  This would obviously be a home run in this case; also, it would prevent Grynberg from getting his hands on documents that he would then pretend to have known about all along in his qui tam action, bolstering his original source argument.  Also discussed was the following:
	
	a.  No one could articulate a good removal theory, although there was much discussion.  Unlike the Quinque case, there is no offshore gas involved here.  Further, there was considerable concern that if the case was removed, Grynberg would try to get it MDL'd, so that the MDL court would hear the remand argument.  There was a concern about that, given the MDL Court's view of Northern's removal in the Quinque case.

	b.  Motions for change of venue.  One basis might be that because, among other things, of the plaintiffs' anticipated argument that they were representing the schoolchildren of Zapata County, defendants may not be able to get a fair trial in Zapata County.

	c.  A plea to the jurisdiction, challenging the standing of RSM to make this claim.  There is a fundamental ambiguity in the pleadings, which is that the suit purports to be both one for the collection of delinquent ad valorem taxes, and one for damages based on fraud, etc.  

	d.  Why the petition mentions ""Other counties"".  I raised the possibility of communitized or unitized leases with wells in adjacent counties; another thought was that this was an invitation to other county school boards to intervene.  I also mentioned that I did not interpret the petition to include the State of Texas as a party, but that it was not entirely clear.  Others agreed about the poor draftsmanship, but the concensus is that the State of Texas (which apparently cannot collect ad valorem taxes anyway) is not a party or being represented as such by RSM.

	e.  I raised the possibility of a motion to abate, based on the pending Quinque case, which purports to be a class action on behalf of, among others, taxing authorities.  The concensus was that this was not a good idea, primarily because it would force us to concede that plaintiffs were in fact adequately represented in Quinque, where they are not parties, and where we are vigorously contesting class certification.

	f. An argument based on lack of indispensable parties, to include all the actual Zapata County taxpayers who haven't paid enough.

	I will continue to keep you advised.  I assume I am reporting to everyone who needs to be in the loop; if that is not correct, please let me know.

	Britt

"Flexible Spending Accounts","Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

"FERC Allocation Proposal","As you know, October 25 is the last day to file with FERC any initial
comments to the Offer of Settlement proposed by this Committee with respect
to, among other things, an allocation formula to provide the amount of each
seller's direct claims against each IOU, the return of collateral and the
winddown of the PX.

It would be most helpful for as many sellers as possible to arrange for
their FERC counsel to file papers in support of the Offer of Settlement.

Of course, if you have any questions about the Offer of Settlement, please
give me a call.  Thanks.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Bedroom golf","
THE RULES OF BEDROOM GOLF 
1. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play - normally 1club 
and 2 balls. 
2. Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole. 
3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and 
keep the balls out. 
4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course 
owners are permitted to check shaft 
stiffness before play begins. 
5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid 
damage to the hole. 
6. The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until 
the course owner is satisfied that play 
is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to 
play the course again. 
7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon 
arrival at the course. The experienced 
player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special 
attention to well formed bunkers. 
8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, 
or are currently playing, to the owner 
of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to 
damage players equipment for this 
reason. 
9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own 
protection. 
10.Players should ensure themselves that their match has been properly 
scheduled, particularly when a new 
course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been 
known to become irate if they discover 
someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course. 
11.Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. 
Some players may be embarrassed if 
they find the course to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised 
to be extremely tactful in this 
situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play 
when this is the case. 
12.The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush 
around the hole to allow for 
improved viewing of, alignment with, and approach to the hole. 
13.Players are advised to obtain the course owners permission before 
attempting to play the back nine. 
14.Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared to 
proceed at a quicker pace, at least 
temporarily, at the course owners request. 
15.It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play 
the same hole several times in one 
match. 
Virginity can be cured.

On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest, in view of the SCE Counterclaim.  Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement.

Subject: Re: CPX - Response to PGE


We believe that a paragraph should be added objecting to the waiver of the
Rule 26(a) and (f) requirements respecting ""Electric Generation Claims.""
Given PG&E's stated intention to object to market participants' claims, PG&E
should not be exempted from nor should we be deprived of these mandatory
disclosures.  Moreover, PG&E's concession that it will comply if ""ordered in
connection with particular claim objections"" impermissibly puts the burden
on market participants to seek an order mandating compliance on a
claim-by-claim basis.

Gail,

One of Dechert's transactional lawyers has been asked to represent Kaiser
Aluminum in a derivatives transaction in which Enron Metals is on the other
side.  We do not believe that this would impair in any way our ability to
represent Enron and its other subsidiaries in the York matter.  I wanted,
however, to bring it to your attention in case you have any concerns.
Please let me know that this is ok.  Thanks, and sorry to bring this up at

"RSM Production, et al. v. El Paso, et al.","
	Richard,

	This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced referral.  You told me that we were to act as first-chair trial counsel in this matter, and instructed me to retain local counsel immediately.

	On the recommendation of Susman & Godfrey and Willy Wood of Fulbright & Jaworski, and with Jim Derrick's authority, I am happy to report that I have retained Lazaro Garza-Gongora of Laredo as local counsel for us in this matter, at his usual hourly rate of $175, and a retainer of $5,000, to be applied by him against his fees and expenses.   By acting quickly on this, we eliminated the risk of the remaining defendants snapping up all available local counsel and being forced to beg for a share of one.  I would of course be willing to consider sharing Lazaro (and his fees) with other defendants, but with the understanding that in the event of a conflict, Lazaro would only represent us, and would be allowed to stay in the case. 

	I anticipate that there will be a comprehensive joint defense agreement in this matter and that both local counsel and experts, including gas measurement experts, may be shared.  I will be speaking with you shortly about retaining a gas measurement expert.

	Lazaro is going to the courthouse to review the court's file and will report shortly on what he finds.

	Please let me know how you want Lazaro's bills handled.

	Please let me know who needs to be in the reporting loop on this one.

	As always, we greatly appreciate the chance to work with you.

	I will keep you closely advised.

	Britt

"RSM v. El Paso","
	Just a heads-up:

	Today at 1:30 there will be a joint defense conference call to discuss the thoughts of the group on what pleadings to file on or before December 5, the new deadline for defendants to move, answer or otherwise plead.  I believe that I previously e-mailed to you drafts prepared by F&J for El Paso and circulated to the group.  Each of the defendant groups is planning to prepare and file its own pleas to the jurisdiction, answers, and affirmative defenses.  I will prepare and circulate drafts tailored to the only two Enron defendants yet served, Enron Corp. and Intratex.  By copy of this, I am asking Becky Stephens to again confirm that we have no evidence that Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. has been served.

	A strategy issue under consideration is whether to file motions to transfer venue for the holding companies, like Enron Corp. So far, based on the due diligence I have done to date, it does not appear that Enron Corp. ever owned or operated any facilities in Zapata County (much less measured gas there) or owned any gas reserves or gas in storage, which should be the relevant considerations. I was asked by the joint defense group to do some legal research on this issue, given that Grynberg has made ""in concert"" allegations against all the defendants, and that we expect Grynberg to rely on venue being good against EOG Resources and trying to keep the remaining defendants (those who are not measurers and therefor independently subject to venue) based on section 15.005 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which allows venue against co-defendants in situations like this where the allegations concern the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurences.  

	In short, the caselaw I have seen causes me a concern we may open ourselves up to merits discovery on the ""in concert"" allegations by filing a motion to transfer venue on behalf of the holdling companies.  I have already mentioned that to other defense counsel and expect that issue to be discussed at our telephone conference this afternoon.

	Also, please let me know whether you want me to send any of the proposed pleadings to Barrett Reasoner or Charlie Tetrault, or to discuss our strategy Barrett or Charlie, to coordinate with strategy in the Grynberg and Quinque cases.

	Parenthetically, our due diligence investigation of Intratex has revealed an accounting document which appears to list an Intratex facility in Zapata County.  This makes no sense and is very puzzling to those we have interviewed at Enron about it.  We will be meeting later this week with AEP employees who will hopefully be able to shed some light on this.
	
	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim against Underwriters","	
	Steve,

	I understand that you are out today; I hope it's vacation.

	By tomorrow (Friday), we will have a notebook with Underwriters' most recent request for invoices and supporting documents, with responses (the documents you gave us).

	May I impose on you again to meet on Friday with me and Becky Zikes, my legal assistant, to review the documentation and make sure we have attached the (a) correct and (b) complete supports?  I recall someone else you worked meeting with us at the same time you gave us the supporting documents, but my notes don't reflect her name.  If you think it would be profitable to have that person in the meeting, let's get her included.

	After you and I meet, I will be sending a copy of this package of documents to Jim Studdert, to discuss the best and most expedient manner of presenting this to Sharron West.  Jim is out until Monday, and then in the office only sporadically until November 8.  I have a meeting scheduled with him Monday morning (with our broker to join us by phone).

	Given our short time frame before the two-year statute of limitations against Baytank expires, I am preparing a lawsuit to be filed against them to preserve any causes of action that we may have.  I am considering asking Baytank for an extension of time to sue, but I know that we did that in the past, and Baytank said no.

	I look forward to hearing about your availablity for a meeting on Friday.  Becky and I would be happy to come over there, or set up a conference room for you to come over here.

	Britt

In short, there is no conference call set for today; however, Jesus has brought back with him (from Cresendo's offices) copies of all the correspondence between Cresendo and Rocky Mountain Helium.  These documents also contain an opinion letter from Cresendo's outside counsel, Bill Ward, at Pruitt, Gushee and Bachtell.  I've also learned that ENA owns about 85-90% of Cresendo with the remainder being owned by NG Resources (a BCCK Engineering entity) and Cresendo Energy Partners.  Cresendo Energy Partners is owned by Ken Krissa and another guy and is the managing member of the LLC.  I'm getting a copy of the LLC agreeemnt .
I'll keep you posted.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Form Settlement Agreement","Richard -

I have a small contract matter involving Enron Credit that requires a settlement agreement.

Basically, EC orally agreed to have a third party develop and host a website that would provide the EC information to site subscribers.  These subscribers might also be subscribers to other products promoted by the third party.  The written agreement backing up the oral agreement was due to be finalized on Friday of last week, but, as you can imagine was not actually signed.

As EC is not pursuing its business at this time, it has asked to terminate the relationship with this third party - a termination that will cost $96K.

I have been asked to do a settlement agreement and was wondering if there is any particular form that Enron uses or that you may have for this type of deal.  It is rather simple in nature, but we do want to make sure that all necessary release language is included.

Thanks.

Mark

"RE: Vinmar","I am very happy to have you involved to the extent you want to be.  I asked Steve Elliott to be the corporate rep for the arbitration because Richard Sanders did not expect that you would want to take that much time for such a modest matter in terms of potential recovery ($90,000-145,000). 

Currently, we have the following scheduled:

Th, Oct. 25	Deposition of Tim Clifford	(If there are any questions, issues you would specifically like for me to discuss with Tim, please let me know)

Fr, Nov. 2	Hearing on Motion to Compel and for Sanctions	This hearing is expected to last 1-2 hours and relates to the issue of production of tape recordings related to conversations between you or Steve and Tim Clifford  during December 1999.  I expect that Richard Sanders and I will attend this hearing.

Tu, Nov. 6	Mediation			This mediation will take the better part of a day.  I need a corporate representative in attendance who is able to make decisions re settlement, and who can speak to issues such as custom and standards in the industry, that deals are routinely made with credit finalized later, etc.  Steve is available to attend that day, but if you'd prefer that would certainly be okay with me.  I anticipate that Vinmar will have a its lawyers and a corporate representative from Vinmar.  I doubt that Tim Clifford will be there since he is no longer with the company.  If we decide to have Steve present, perhaps we can arrange a short meeting prior to the mediation to discuss strategy and settlement authority.

Tu/We, Dec. 18-19	Arbitration		If the matter is not settled at mediation, the arbitration will take place on Dec. 18 and carry over to Dec. 19, if necessary.  I will need a corporate representative there the entire time.  Steve is available to act as corporate representative, but let me know if you'd prefer to do so.  If you are not available for the entire time period, it would be helpful to have you available for a couple of hours to give your testimony re the making of the contract in person; however, I can use your deposition testimony if you are not available.  I have confirmed that Debbie Brackett will be available to give her testimony at the arbitration hearing.

Please let me know if you have any other questions/comments re this matter.  Thanks.

"12/27 Meeting","Sheryl: I think I mentioned to those on the call that the Dec 27 call would
be a placeholder for a meeting just in case we need to have a discussion
regarding the PGE plan, FERC developments or the PX plan, all of which will
probably have developments over the next few days.  Noone, including me,
wants to spend any more time than is necessary in meetings, at this time of
the year or any other time.  Therefore, I propose to leave the scheduled
call for 12/27 in place for the moment, with the hope that we can cancel it
or limit it to a short call.  I am pleased to note that our calls have
gotten shorter, and we have scheduled separate calls from time to time to
discuss individual topics when necessary.

I too want the subcommittees to address the more detailed issues and to
bring issues to the full committee as appropriate.  In many instances, this
is what is happening.  However, as you know, the members of the full
committee often want to discuss topics in detail and I try to give everyone
an opportunity to voice their views, while at the same time trying to move
things along.  I am sure that everyone is busy and brings up items to
discuss during the committee meetings only when they think they are
important enough to take up the time of the full committee.  We all owe that
to each other.

At our next meeting, I will propose to schedule the regular calls two weeks
apart, with the understanding that we can schedule more frequent meetings
when necessary.  Thanks for the suggestion.

"Hi family","We need to talk about the XMAS thing this year...as well as scheduling our
Perd clean-up that was postponed to 2002.

Does anyone have suggestions on XMAS giving.  Since last year we bought the
playscape, I didn't know if we wanted to try to do something at the Perd
again.  It is obvious to most that the Perd is getting that runned down look
and needs some tendor loving care and some updating.  But where to start is
the question I am asking.  But does this have to do with XMAS.

Please book the weekend of January 25th for the Perd Clean-Up...no kids.
Ryan, I think, is the only one old enough to truely help out if he wants to.
Also, be sure to bring the family big car...so we can haul off things to
dispose of.

We will also need to paint.  At least the bathrooms downstairs.

Mom, you will need to decide on what dollar amount you intend to spend this
year on maintenance.  And then we can decide on the rest.

Besides the XMAS thing...these are the ""wants and needs"" of the Perd;

1)  Siding replaced
2) Road to the Water bulldozed
3)  Freshen Up the furniture....in the main room.  New couches...or other
things
4) Cement in a sports court with basketball hoop to replace the garden area

Ideas for XMAS...anyone...anyone.  One idea, for ease sake, would be giving
each cousin a gift certificate...to say Barnes and Noble...for that child to
spend as he/she would like.  A denomination of $25...which would be $65.00
per family.  I would be glad to buy, collect and send out.  This is just an
idea.

Looking forward to comments and soon.

"TRAINING RIDE TIME CHANGE","Just a reminder about this training ride each Sunday.  Some of you have already received this announcement, but just wanted you to know that the time of the ride has changed.  Beginning February 3, the ride will begin at 8:00 AM each Sunday.

-----------------------------------------------------------HERE'S THE PREVIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT WITH THE TIME CHANGE INCLUDED----------------------------------------------

	Hey Team! It is time to start training for the MS150, and we have arranged a great training opportunity for our new Team Sun & Ski.  I am so excited to tell you that Bill Edwards has agreed to lead a weekly ride (every Sunday),  departing from the Sun & Ski store at Katy Mills Mall (northeast corner of the mall) at 8:00 AM.  On this training ride, you can choose your distances from 11 to 64 miles.  This is a tremendous opportunity for you to learn from the very best in the sport of cycling.  I have worked with Bill on various cycling activities for several years and admire his dedication in encouraging people to participate in cycling as an excellent way of pursuing a healthy and rewarding lifestyle.   Please let me tell you more about Bill:

Bill Edwards has been involved in competitive cycling for more than 55 years.  He has been actively coaching cyclists since 1980.

Bill began his racing career in San Diego, California as a Junior in 1947 and advanced from category III to II to I (known then as ""C"", ""B"", and ""A"") by age 18.  He competed as a senior in Southern California during the 1950's while attending UCLA.  More recently, Bill won the USCF Texas Masters State Championship Road Race and Time Trial, and the Texas State Senior Olympics in his age category.  In 1997 Bill won a bronze medal in the National Senior Olympics in Tucson, Arizona, and in 1998 he won four Gold Medals at U.S. Masters National Championships (see below).

Bill has coached five U.S. National Team members, nine U.S. National Champions, and two Master's World champions.  He currently holds a USA Cycling Elite coaching license. Bill was selected as a U.S. Olympic Festival coach in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1995, and at the 1991 Olympic Festival he held the position of head coach.  He is well known throughout the state of Texas as a highly qualified cycling coach.  Bill is the Team Director of the Southern Elite Youth Cycling Race Team (a team dedicated to identifying and developing talented young athletes).  Southern Elite is the number one team among 98 teams in the State of Texas for 2001 (see txbra.org).  Bill currently is the coach of 6-time Masters World Champion Al Whaley who, along with Paralympian Pam Fernandes, recently won a Gold Medal and a Silver Medal at the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney, Australia.  Al & Pam set a World Record and two Paralympic records in the process.

Please join us as often as you can.  There is no charge, and maps will be provided at the start.

See you soon!

Michelle,

It looks like my contacts have added more than one addition to our list of

possible Enron employees.  I am forwarding on this complete list w/ 25 more

possible employees to search.  Can you let us know if these people were

Enron employees and their dates of employment?   Sorry, I didn't send this

list with the request yesterday, but it was not generated at the time of

the request.

Thank you,

Kevin Kosub

"In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters","
	Steve,

	I spoke with Knight of Philchem about other potentially responsible Baytank entities.  He was not aware of any.  Knight was anxious to confirm that since I was telling him Enron was filing suit against Philchem and was not telling him we were filing suit against Philchem, that we would not sue Philchem.  I told him that I could not tell him one way or another on that.  Knight was unhappy about that, but resigned.

	I have also spoke twice with David See of Baytank about getting an extension of time to file suit.  See told me that neither his president nor the lady who knows about the claim were available, so he, with apologies, couldn't give me an extension of time to file suit, and understood that I would be filing suit tomorrow afternoon.

	I did tell See that I would consider giving Baytank an extension of time to answer.

	I will go forward with filing suit tomorrow afternoon, assuming that I hear of no objections from any other Enron entity to my filing suit.

	Britt

Subject: PX



Howard Weg is setting up a meeting next week to negotiate a resolution of PX's claim against Edison.  The claim is for something north of $900 million.  Edison indicated that, barring settlement, it would just pay the full amount to PX.  If refunds are ordered by FERC or if Edison otherwise successfully pursues claims against participants, it will just look to the participants to pay.  Edison is willing to particpate in discussions aimed at settling the FERC issues and possibly providing funding for the post-reorganization PX (although, if deals are cut with Edison and PG & E, is there anything for the PX to do?).  Enron is on the Edison subcommittee in the PX case.  Edison wants company representatives available for next week's meeting either on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Do we want to participate and, if so, who will either attend or be available on the telephone from Enron?

"LET'S GET STARTED","	Hey Team! It is time to start training for the MS150, and we have arranged a great training opportunity for our new Team Sun & Ski.  I am so excited to tell you that Bill Edwards has agreed to lead a weekly ride (every Sunday),  departing from the Sun & Ski store at Katy Mills Mall (northeast corner of the mall) at 9:00 AM.  On this training ride, you can choose your distances from 11 to 64 miles.  This is a tremendous opportunity for you to learn from the very best in the sport of cycling.  I have worked with Bill on various cycling activities for several years and admire his dedication in encouraging people to participate in cycling as an excellent way of pursuing a healthy and rewarding lifestyle.   Please let me tell you more about Bill:

Bill Edwards has been involved in competitive cycling for more than 55 years.  He has been actively coaching cyclists since 1980.

Bill began his racing career in San Diego, California as a Junior in 1947 and advanced from category III to II to I (known then as ""C"", ""B"", and ""A"") by age 18.  He competed as a senior in Southern California during the 1950's while attending UCLA.  More recently, Bill won the USCF Texas Masters State Championship Road Race and Time Trial, and the Texas State Senior Olympics in his age category.  In 1997 Bill won a bronze medal in the National Senior Olympics in Tucson, Arizona, and in 1998 he won four Gold Medals at U.S. Masters National Championships (see below).

Bill has coached five U.S. National Team members, nine U.S. National Champions, and two Master's World champions.  He currently holds a USA Cycling Elite coaching license. Bill was selected as a U.S. Olympic Festival coach in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1995, and at the 1991 Olympic Festival he held the position of head coach.  He is well known throughout the state of Texas as a highly qualified cycling coach.  Bill is the Team Director of the Southern Elite Youth Cycling Race Team (a team dedicated to identifying and developing talented young athletes).  Southern Elite is the number one team among 98 teams in the State of Texas for 2001 (see txbra.org).  Bill currently is the coach of 6-time Masters World Champion Al Whaley who, along with Paralympian Pam Fernandes, recently won a Gold Medal and a Silver Medal at the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney, Australia.  Al & Pam set a World Record and two Paralympic records in the process.

Please join us as often as you can.  There is no charge, and maps will be provided at the start.

See you soon!  (We think the weather will be good for this Sunday)

"Retail litigation","I gather that Bob will be spending most of his time on the securities litigation.  Is it still possible to get a litigation manager to  handle EES matters.  I would hope we could use one of the EWS litigators, as we discussed earlier.  Having someone on the floor would be a definite plus as well. I had talked to Andy but  never finalized because of the crisis situation we are in.  My main concern is that the EES business not be allocated among numerous litigators so that we do have accountability  or take a back seat to other assignments.  Thanks.

We have not made public the SCE amount (as far as I'm aware).  We need to make sure that IR is in the loop - I think that Mark Koenig is following this issue.

Have we disclosed the $125 million SCE number in any other filing that you can recall that is public.  At the FERC maybe?  We are considering including it in our stip to be filed at the CPUC.  Peggy, would this be a problem?

"RSM v. El Paso","
	Marianne,

	This will confirm our conference regarding your further due diligence.  Here are the to-do's:

	1.  You will call Steve Schneider and anyone else you need to to find out whether a database still exists that captures all ENA-related sale and/or transport contracts for Zapata county from 1980-1995.

	2.  With regard to the Zapata County meter numbers listed in the PCS Synergi database document that you showed me, which reflects all ENA-related purchase contracts from 1980-1995, you will double-check to make sure that there is no evidence of any purchase contract listing Enron Corp., Intratex or EGM as a counterparty.  If there is, you will research whether there was any evidence of actual purchase activity under any of these meters. With regard to the meters shown on that document, both ""off-system"" and ""on-system"", you will research who owned or operated them.

	3.  With regard to the Zapata County contracts in the new Global system, which shows all ENA-related purchase, sale or transportation contracts from 1999 forward, you will research the contracts that do appear to show ENA as a counter-party for actual purchase activity and at what meters.  Also, since the report you drew up does not show meter numbers, you will drill down for those as well, and see if there are any meters in addition to those shown in the PCS Synergi document.  If there are, you will research the identity of those as well.

	Please keep me closely advised.

	Britt

"Kansas - The ""Motorcycle"" Argument","Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

Here is the ""motorcycle"" argument, excerpted from the 10/15/01 transcript:

MR. REBEIN: Thank you, Your
Honor. Good afternoon. I will be arguing
on behalf of the defendants, as will my
colleague, Mr. Griffin. And then I think
also appearing today and arguing will be
Mr. Eisenbrandt and Mr. Flaherty on behalf
of their clients. We've tried to divide up
this argument, Your Honor, under -- to
cover of as many bases as we can with as
little repetition as possible.
And so I want to -- in the interest of
the good use of time, Your Honor, I want to
begin this argument by telling you about
the motorcycle trip that I just returned
from in Texas. On that trip, I went with a
friend of mine, and he had a new
motorcycle. And I asked him, ""Okay, how
many gallons does that tank hold?"" And he
said, ""Well, Honda says five gallons.""
Well, in Oklahoma, the first time we filled
up, sure enough, it took 5.2 gallons. And
he turned to me, and he said, ""That
bastard.""
Then we went to Texas, and we filled
up, and it took 5.3 gallons. Then he
turned to me, and he said, ""Those bastards;
it's a conspiracy.""
Now, I didn't tell him that my
friendship with Rex Sharp would provide me
with a nationwide remedy for this problem,
because I could have told him that what we
needed to do was for me, even though I
didn't buy the gasoline, to return to
Kansas where we bought none of the
gasoline, where I would sue on behalf of
all buyers of gasoline against all sellers
of gasoline for the last 25 years
nationwide, and all I would have to do is
say the words, ""There was a conspiracy to
mismeasure."" How? I don't know; they've
got all that information. When? I don't
know, but it had to be in the last 25
years. Who? I don't know, so let's
include all of them. And where? Well,
there's only one guy I know well enough to
make these arguments to, and that's Judge
Smith, so let's do it there.

"York Paper Litigation","	As you might recall, York filed two summonses against Enron and Eric Holzer in two separate lawsuits' connected with the parties' dealings in the paper market. The two summonses (as allowed by Pennsylvania law) lacked any information about York's claims against Enron or Mr. Holzer. The Enron defendants removed their suits to federal court. Dechert is the Enron defendants' outside counsel.  
	We have finally received York's complaint detailing its claims against Enron and Mr. Holzer.  In a nutshell, York claims that Enron hired Holzer away from York in an effort to steal York's customer base and then, contrary to the parties' agreement and custom in the industry, proceeded to steal customers from York. Specifically, York claims that the only reason it let Holzer out of his non-compete agreement with York is because both Holzer and Enron promised: that they would honor the allegedly established practice in the paper industry preventing competitors from usurping each other's client relationships by selling paper directly to each other's clients, and that York would get new business from Enron. It is York's position that Holzer took confidential and proprietary information from York when he left that company, gave this information to Enron and that Enron and Holzer used this information to wrongfully steal York's customers. 
	York has alleged causes of action against Enron and Holzer for:
	1.	Theft of trade secrets,
	2.	Breach of contract (several counts),
	3.	Tortuous interference with contractual relations,
	4.	Tortuous interference with prospective contractual relations,
	5.	Fraudulent inducement,
	6.	Unfair competition, and 
	7.	Civil conspiracy.
	My initial impression is that York should be more worried about having agreements with its competitors preventing business solicitation then Enron should be worried about a predatory pricing claim; however, I don't know enough about the facts to have a firm view of the case. We are in the process of getting more information about these claims and I'll update you again after we have talked to our folks about this.  In the meantime, please call with any questions or comments.

	This is an unfiled claim by Franklin Adkins, a small gas producer in the Appalachians, for recovery of approximately $336,832.17 for the alleged breach of a gas purchase agreement.  By letter dated December 3, Michael Farrell of Farrell, Farrell & Farrell, L.C., Adkins's attorney, requested that Adkins' named be included in the list of creditors and that a proof of claim be forwarded to Mr. Adkins in accordance with the Court's Scheduling Order.

"RSM Production v. El Paso","
	This will report on last Thursday's meeting of the joint defense group.  All the defendants were represented by either in-house or outside counsel.  Parenthetically, plaintiffs have still not served Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.  The only Enron defendants who have been served are Intratex and Enron Corp.  Parenthetically, again, all served defendants have been given an extension of time until December 5 to move, answer or otherwise plead.

	The items discussed were as follows:

	1.  Comment on the wording and time frame for filing three draft form pleadings prepared by F&J:  

	a.  a motion to the plaintiff's counsel to show authority;

	b.  a plea to the jurisdiction; and

	c. an answer and affirmative answer.

	2.  Whether the holding companies should file motions to transfer venue.

	3.  Whether there should be a joint defense fund, with a formal joint defense agreement.

	At the end of the discussion, it was concluded as follows:

	1.  The F&J draft pleadings looked good, and all agreed to recommend to their respective client group that (a) each group of defendants would file their own plea, answer and affirmative defenses on December 5, the deadline for doing so (I will circulate a draft tailored for the Enron defendants well before then) but that (b) all the served defendants would join in the motion to show authority. Although, strictly speaking, this is not a classic case for a motion to show authority, no one saw a downside to it, and thought the presence of such a motion would be additional help in putting off any discovery requests.  The big concern in this case is keeping Grynberg from getting discovery here that could help him in his other cases.

	2.  I was tasked with the job of legal research on whether the non-measurer, non-taxpayer holding companies had a good shot at a motion to transfer venue, and whether there was any downside to so moving.  Of course, under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, such a motion must be filed before any other plea or pleading but for a special appearance, or it is waived.

	3.  No one appeared interested in a joint defense fund or a formal joint defense agreement, and it was agreed that the parties would pass around projects for the common good (like item #2) on a ""rough justice"" basis.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

"RE: PG&E","I reviewed the document and it seems fairly accurate.  I have a slight disagreement with one statement, as follows: ""The Commission's reference to ""surcharge"" can be interpreted to mean both the one cent and three cent surcharges given that both surcharges were granted similar treatment in D.01-03-082.""  I don't agree that this is so black and white.  One can also take the interpretation that it was meant to apply only to the 3 cent and not to the 1 cent surcharge.  Obviously, SCE took the former interpretation and PG&E the latter.  That is one reason why we have been very careful about attacking this issue.   AReM has protested PG&E charging the one cent surcharge and supported Edison's approach in responding to the advice letters filed months ago.  AReM continues to work with the CPUC staff to get the staff to support AReM when it responds to the advice letters.  Be aware that there are strong forces working against ESPs and anything potentially favorable to them. The more we can accomplish this under the radar screen, the better off we will be. Commissioner Wood is still attacking retroactivity and many have raised the ""cost shifting"" issue.  In other words, we can still lose the 3 cent exclusion.  We have to be careful how we proceed.

DJ Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal<ENE.N><MSFT.O>
   By Michael Rieke
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

    HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling
was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for
his company's foundering broadband business.

    Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth
for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron
would give more details on the deal later.

    After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence
by suing Microsoft.

    In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron
claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal.

    The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide
network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed
Internet service, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for
use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the
deal, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal,
so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal,
the lawsuit said.

"FW: Assignment of Tarpon Offshore, L.P.","

 -----Original Message-----

Cc:	Chris Goodrich; Allan D. Keel; sjosey@mariner-energy.com
Subject:	Assignment of Tarpon Offshore, L.P.

Gentlemen:

Tarpon Operating & Development, LLC (""Tarpon"") and Mr. Allan Keel
conferenced by phone on Friday, November 9, 2001, regarding Tarpon Offshore,
L.P. (""Partnership"") interests.  The conversation was in reference to
reaching a resolution regarding the funding of projects now in the
Partnership portfolio as well as the continued participation of the Limited
Partners (ECT Merchant Investments Corp. and Joint Energy Development
Investments II Limited Partnership) in the Partnership.  Mr. Allan Keel
represented that Mr. John Thompson, Vice President & Co-Manager of Enron
North America, had authorized him to negotiate a resolution with Tarpon.
According to Mr. Keel, the Limited Partners would not be able to fund the
previously approved Eugene Island 386 project, and furthermore, did not wish
to continue to participate in the Partnership.  In light of these facts, the
following framework for a resolution was agreed to by Tarpon and Mr. Keel:

	1)	The Limited Partners will assign all interest in the Partnership to
Tarpon, the General Partner.

	2)	Tarpon and the Limited Partners will provide mutual releases to each
other.

	3)	Enron North America Corp. (""Enron"") will retain a contingent liability
for certain portions of the Eugene Island 386 project.  Specifically, if
Tarpon is unable to secure alternative funding for the project, Enron will
be liable to Tarpon and will pay immediately upon demand for Tarpon's share
of the cost to permanently plug and abandon the wellbore that current exists
on the Eugene Island 386 property and for all non-refundable portions (e.g.
restocking fees, engineering costs) of Tarpon's share of the cost for the
subsea tree/wellhead assembly that has been committed to for the Eugene
Island 386 project.

	4)	Payment by Enron for all legal fees incurred for the preparation and
execution of the documents in reference to this matter.

Time is of the essence in the preparation and execution of a document to
reflect Tarpon's understanding of the above terms.  Tarpon needs this
document to be executed no later than Friday, November 16, 2001.  If Tarpon
does not receive this release by that time, material damage to Tarpon's
ongoing business interest is very likely.  Tarpon's attorney, Mr. Chris
Goodrich, is available to spearhead this effort and prepare whatever
documents are required.

If you should have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me at
(281) 493-6336 or Mr. Ralph McBee at (281) 493-5885.

Regards.

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation
	Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan. 

	The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB).

	In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's withdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.  The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan. 

	Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Other Contingencies
	Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

	Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for wholesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in available hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-reliance on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California's regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs and certain obligations related to the difference between third party power purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and SCE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstanding obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange (the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System Operator (the Independent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.

	Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initiatives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not possible to predict their outcome at this time.

	Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utilities, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energy in California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of these entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

	India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol Power Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constructing an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasification facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the guarantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The contract disputes relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documents and (b) MSEB's statements that MSEB has ""rescinded"" the PPA and MSEB is therefore no longer bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Phase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts for non-payment.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actions are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pursue all available legal remedies under the project documents.  As a result of these disputes, the 740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by MSEB.  Further, Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II.  Enron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

Why don't we let richard Sanders know about this.  I agree with Kenton that someone is probably up to no good.  However, if I understand the document, it is (or will) probably be public one day anyway.  I would let Richard know just as an FYI and see what are his comments.

Who is Rad?  This is Lodi's application to itself for approval to use the plant site for a generating plant?  If the AG office wants to see it, I have trouble imagining a harmless reason:  I almost wonder if the AG is interested in whether the city would have legal authority to both apply and approve.  But somebody would have had to arouse the state's interest; who would do that?  PG&E?

If the application is a public document, then the state could easily get it anyway, so it's OK to send it, but why wouldn't the state have asked the city for it?

Gentlemen- 
FYI - Tim Murphy at URS called me today to let me know that Rad Bartlam called him and asked him to send a copy of the Lodi Land Use Application to the State Attorney General's Office.  Rad said he didn't know why they wanted it, and Tim has no clue either.  I told Tim it was OK to send it.  Any guesses as to why they want it?

"Perry Gas","I know this is but a nuisance at this time, but a credible buyer of claims
-- Liquidity Solutions -- has made a written offer to purchase the 3 Enron
claims in the Perry Gas case at 40% of the claim.  Because of the size of
the 3 claims (ENA, EES, and Clinton), the amount of money that this would
raise is well over $2 million if my memory serves.  Yesterday, Liquidity
Solutions called again and increased its offer to 45%.

Perry Gas is still predicting a payout in the 55% range, but that payout
will be over time given that there is litigation going on that needs to be
resolved before all payouts can be made.

Because ENA, EES, and Clinton all have ""allowed"" claims, many of the risks
(and hassles) associated with selling claims is removed.

I have sent the proposed 40% offers to Jim Keller, Michael Tribolet, and
you, but -- understandably -- have heard nothing back.

I just wanted to remind you that this is out there if you have any interest
in liquidating your Perry Gas claims at this point.  Given that the payout
will probably take another 12 months, the last dollars would go to Dynegy.
If asked for my recommendation, it would be to sell them at this point.

I'm happy to give you more exact numbers of the amount of the claims and
what the payout would be if you're interested.  Thanks so much.

I'll call later about setting up a meeting.  Thanks.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

"Power Outage at Enron Building","
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Who is Rad?  This is Lodi's application to itself for approval to use the plant site for a generating plant?  If the AG office wants to see it, I have trouble imagining a harmless reason:  I almost wonder if the AG is interested in whether the city would have legal authority to both apply and approve.  But somebody would have had to arouse the state's interest; who would do that?  PG&E?

If the application is a public document, then the state could easily get it anyway, so it's OK to send it, but why wouldn't the state have asked the city for it?

"Cal PX Plan and Disclosure Statement","During today's Committee meeting/conference call among the matters
discussed involving the plan and disclosure statement were the following:

1.   Informal comments or concerns about the plan and disclosure statement
should be given to me no later than Friday, November 30th, so that we can
make appropriate modifications to enable us to file and serve an amended
plan and disclosure statement in sufficient time before the January 8th
hearing date for the disclosure statement.  Accordingly, I would very much
appreciate hearing from you in writing, by e-mail or by telephone next week
on this subject.

2.   We will invite members of the Committee along with representatives of
Duke, Dyengy and Williams (as well as others members of the Committee
identify as having a particular interest in the formulation of the plan and
disclosure statement) to participate in a special meeting/conference call
at 10:00 am (Pacific time) on December 10th to take another pass at the
plan and disclosure statement .  We will extend the invitation tomorrow or
Monday.  If you believe it appropriate to extend an invitation to a
particular participant, please get back to me as quickly as possible.

3.   We will immediately embark on obtaining information from Cal PX as to
the amounts reflected on the Cal PX books so that we can file a motion for
court approval of participant plan voting rights and claim amounts owing to
participants for voting purposes only.  Such a motion would be set for
hearing on the disclosure statement hearing date.  Under this scenario, any
participant concerned that the amount of its claim for voting purposes so
set would be understated will have the opportunity to object.  If we are
unsuccessful in getting the information from the debtor, we will
immediately file a motion on shortened time for the court  to set a special
bar date to coincide with the hearing date on the disclosure statement for
the filing by participants of proofs of claims for voting purposes only.
Following one of these two procedures will be necessary in order to
establish entitlement of participants to vote on the plan as members of
classes 6,7 and/or 8.

If you wish to discuss any of the foregoing with me, please give me a call.

I would ask Mike about the last sentence in bullet 5.  Based on the language of the quote the Commission appears to be referring to the surcharge ""adopted in D. 01-03-082.""  Was the .01 surcharge ""adopted"" in that proceeding?  Maybe I am reading this too literally.  I do agree that the rationale for exempting DA customers from the 3 cent surcharge applies equally to the 1 cent surcharge, and that we should continue to strive for this clarification at the CPUC (which Sue Mara is handling).

"RE: ENA v. Adkins","      Mary,

     Thanks.  It is good news to hear that we overpaid based on the index price for at least one month, because it tends to show that we truly were mistaken and were not gaming Adkins on this deal. I probably do need a copy of the Supplier Reference Book that you prepared.  If you would have kept information pertaining to this review anywhere (electronically or hard-copy), please let me know.  By copy of this, I am asking my legal assistant, Becky Zikes, to follow up with you on this and get copies of all the information in your possession.

     Britt

     P.S. to Wade:  I need to meet with you anyway regarding your review of your notes that you were going to perform.  I would also greatly appreciate your supplying me with copies of whatever business documents we sent to Adkins after the date of the confirm on March 6.  I need to be able to put it in chronological order to fully understand it.  Again, I will have Becky Zikes follow up with you on a meeting where we can review all this documentation. Becky, it would be better for me for the meeting to take place in the second half of next week (and I would like you to attend).

    P.S. to Ron Nolte:  Ron, could I ask you to liaise with Mary and see if there is any way to retrieve the correspondence regarding her internal review that she says was lost when we moved to Outlook?  Please let me know if you need any further information from me on this.

Subject:	RE: ENA v. Adkins

Wade Price should be able help you out on item #1.

I never was really assigned to ""audit"" the Appalachian suppliers.  I was midway through another Appalachian project , when I realized that there were several transport and purchase related issues.  So, I began compiling a Supplier Reference Book to get a better picture of supplier's activity.  I used this book to verify price change request.  I also used it to identify several incorrect requests for pricing adjustments and errors in Settlements' calc-sheets.  My concern for additional purchase errors led me to the review most of the Appalachian purchase deals.  It was during one of these activities that I identified the Adkin's payment errors.  I'm sorry, but I don't have any documented ""audit"" findings.  Any correspondence I did have was lost in the conversion to Outlook.  I do still maintain my Supplier Reference Book, but I don't think it would be much help.  However, I did review the CGAS IF pricing the for the year prior to the deal.  Only one month during that time was the index price higher than the contracted $3.075.  In fact they were considerably lower.  Also, I've reviewed the settlement statements, it appears we paid Mr. Adkins for three months before the error was caught.  The first month was paid at index (index was $0.06 lower than the contract price), the next month was paid at index ( index was $0.22 higher than contract price) and the third month was corrected to the $3.075 ( index was $4.53).   I think this correction made in Oct-00, is when he first realized there was an issue.  I hope this helps you,  Terry 3-7675.

Subject:	ENA v. Adkins


	Stacy,

	This will confirm our telephone conference with Mike Farrell, Franklin Adkins' attorney, today.  Based on my recommendation, you and I followed up with him today to see if Adkins still wanted to pursue his claim, despite our response to him.

	Farrell told us that although his client had not yet received his written legal analysis, Adkins does not want to drop the claim.  Farrell told you and me that he thought the ""mere sending of your confirm"" did not overweigh the months that ENA paid Adkins under the index price, which established in Farrell's view a course of dealing between the parties that made the index price the correct price.  During this short telephone conference, Farrell never said whether his client had received the confirmation.  Of course, our position is that whether Adkins' telefax machine printed out the confirmation is irrelevant; we have the evidence necessary to show that we sent it.

	Farrell told us that he expected to send us a response next week, continuing his demand for arbitration.  He did not say whether there would be any settlement offer in the letter.  I will advise you as soon as I receive Farrell's letter.

	I would be very pleased to arbitrate this for you as your trial counsel.  I believe that Farrell is correct in stating that there are sufficient facts to create a course of performance issue, on which arbitrators could rule in favor of Adkins.  However, I believe that we have a persuasive argument that ENA paid the incorrect price only as a result of a clerical error.  In order to support this argument, we also need to develop the following: 

	1.  Did Franklin Adkins do or not do anything as the result of receipt of payment of the index price for a period of time that disadvantaged him?   The timing of when Adkins first realized he was being paid the index price may be critical.  I need to speak to the right person about how we would have made payment and what business documents were sent to Adkins after the confirm was telefaxed, and get copies of all those documents.  Could someone tell me who that would be?  

	2.  Did ENA correct the price before or after the spot market price rose above the contract price? (You had kindly agreed to do the homework on this).  Also, I need Mary to advise me when she was instructed to perform the internal audit, why and by whom, and get copies from her of all her file material on that audit.

	I greatly appreciate your and everyone else's help.  If anyone has any thoughts on other homework we could or need to be doing, please let me know.  If anyone knows of someone else who needs to be in the loop on this, please let me know.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"RE: CPX - 12/18 Agenda","As I understand it a committee meeting has been scheduled for 12/27.
What is the agenda for this meeting?  I would like to see if we can
start having committee meetings less frequently than once a week.  The
time spent at weekly meetings does not seem necessary and could perhaps
be handled in biweekly meetings with more subcommittee meetings to cover
specific issues that can subsequently be raised with the entire
committee.  In addition, the meeting currently scheduled for 12/27 is
during a time at which many of us will be on vacation and not able to
participate.  If there is something urgent, can we handle it this week
or, if not, can it wait until the first week of January?  I would like
to hear other members thoughts on the frequency of the meetings.  Sheryl

Subject: Alberta Energy's Interest in Mariner


I met with Gary Guidry (VP-International) of Alberta Energy (AEC) in late
September at his request to discuss AEC's plans for expansion into the Gulf
of Mexico. After reviewing Gwen Morgan's overall vision for AEC to become a
global energy concern,
Guidry indicated that AEC had decided to set up a platform in the US Gulf of
Mexico to pursue the deepwater play and serve as
an operating hub for further expansion into other offshore areas worldwide.
AEC's activities to date have been handled by two
technical teams in Houston who normally cover other parts of the world. In
addition to grassroots exploration/exploitation (eg. recent Green Canyon
farm-in deal with Conoco), AEC has conducted an active program to evaluate
M/A opportunities in the Gulf over the past few months.

Based on the goals outlined by Guidry and Mariner's status as a merchant
investment within Enron, I indicated that Mariner Energy might be a perfect
fit for AEC. Pursuant to a conversation with Kelly in early October,  I knew
that I could not give  any advice on
Mariner, so I encouraged him to review the Mariner record and seek feedback
from industry sources on Mariner's reputation.  I
later learned that AEC had initiated direct contact with Mariner and was
pursuing an evaluation of the Company through normal channels.

Guidry called me Tuesday evening to express concern over recent feedback
from Lehman on this matter.  I believe he was calling me as a Mariner Board
member because he could not establish direct contact with appropriate Enron
personnel and was hopeful that I could pass along a message.  Guidry
received a message from Lehman Tuesday saying that the Enron contact (Tim
Detmering) and his boss couldn't consider a sale at this time because it
would result in a book value loss and potentially further erode investor
confidence in Enron.

Given the mixed signals concerning the possible sale of the company and
Guidry's inability to speak directly with an Enron contact, Guidry is
concerned that the feedback through Lehman may have been somehow distorted.
Since I am unaware of Enron's goal for Mariner , I told him I would try to
contact you to verify he was getting the straight scoop from Lehman on
the Enron position.  Guidry's office number is 403/266-8111.

"Yesterday's Hearing in Kansas","
Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication
 
From:  Don Schultz
To:      Kansas JDT Participants
Re:      10/15/01 motion hearing
           A  transcript has been ordered.   Below is my recap. I  encourage other attendees to reply with  corrections or additions you think  would be helpful to folks who did not attend.
           1.   Overall Impressions
           Rex  Sharp's arguments were unclear, complicated, and at times  inconsistent.   I think plaintiffs' lawyers left the Court with  the impression that they are in disarray, not well organized, and  not ready to proceed with a workable approach to the  case.    
         Dave Rebein did an  excellent job of illustrating how bizaare this case is in scope  and substance - you'll want to read the ""motorcycle story"" he told Judge  Smith at the start of his argument to illustrate this.  His  creative approach struck a chord; Judge Smith put his hands in  front of his face in order not to laugh so obviously, but laugh he  did.
          Jim Griffin showed  the Judge that the defendants have invested thousands of  hours collectively to produce the information on their Kansas contacts, and  ably reviewed the case law which frowns on allowing discovery into either p.jd.  or merits where a conspiracy has been pleaded only in conclusory  terms.
         Jim and Dave  presented coordinated, clear arguments and presented  them persuasively.   Their hard preparation work, and that of the  Akin Gump team and many other volunteers, seemed to me to pay off in a  very strong showing.
          Smith listened  to the arguments without saying much or asking questions.   My  sense at the conclusion of the arguments was that the Judge had not read much of  the defendants' briefs, but that Messrs. Rebein and Griffin had  made compelling arguments in line with those in the briefs, whereas Sharp's  arguments remained muddled.  Smith's comments and decisions on the  motions, thus far are summarized as follows.
           2.   Sharp's Pseudo Motion to Compel.  
          Judge Smith  will review the interrogs and requests for production which Sharp  served as ""personal jurisdiction"" discovery.  He will issue some form of  order or statement - he said by this Friday - which identifies those questions  which go too far - are outside what he contemplated in the case management order  as ""limited"" personal jurisdiction discovery, versus those questions he  thinks defendants should answer because they bear on personal  jurisdiction.  This will not constitute a ruling on any  objections.   
            The  defendants will have ten days to further answer or object to any of the  discovery which the Court finds is within the intent of the case management  order as to the scope of personal jurisdiction issues.    Judge  Smith said that he wants future discovery objections to be filed with/sent to  him immediately so he can get a response from the other side and rule on  objections quickly - he wants to know about discovery objections  ""before God hears the news"" (something like that).
         Judge Smith gave a  brief overview of the parties' opposing  positions on the scope of  permissible jurisdiction discovery - the defendants limiting that scope to  ""contacts"" and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits  discovery.  He did not seem prepared to agree with either party  completely.  He said that it was his intent from the outset to spare  the defendants from full merits discovery until he determined the scope of  the court's jurisdiction, and it seemed that he intends to continue to draw  a distinction between limited and full discovery.  Pointing to a blow-up  which Messrs. Rebein and Griffin used, he indicated that some of the requests do  appear to go well beyond personal jurisdiction  issues.   He also said, though, that the jurisdictional  issues may not be limited to ""contacts"" as the defendants contend.   
           I left the  courtroom unsure how Smith will decide which questions he thinks are within  and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the CMO allows.  It  is not clear whether he will look at the law on the sufficiency of pleading  a conspiracy, or whether he will look at the case law on whether or  not pleading a conspiracy can extend the scope of  personal jursdiction to reach ""no-contacts"" alleged conspirators.    Neither side really pushed him to decide those legal points now.   He  left himself all options as still open.   I had  the impression that the Judge had not read the discovery requests at  all - even though defendants had attached them as an exhibit - and that  he expects (perhaps naively) that the boundary between limited  personal jurisdiction and merits discovery to be clear to him as he  looks at the questions one at a time.  
       Sharp tendered to the Judge a copy of  the Tejas defendants objections and answers.  Other defense counsel  requested leave to submit their defendants' responses and  objections.   The Court finally realized that the defendants were  concerned he would be ruling to compel discovery without having considered the  various objections, and so made clear he is only going to now evaluate Sharp's  questions, give some guidance on which questions seem within the scope of the  order, and the defendants can make objections as needed.
       The Judge seemed frustrated that  Sharp had not provided him the discovery questions with his motion, and  also seemed perturbed by the form of the motion.  He said ""I don't  know what this motion is . . . there is no such motion . . .  Plaintiffs are just making stuff up . . . I don't like it when parties make  stuff up, because then I don't know what to do.""
             3.  PSCo - Colorado and KCS motions to compel.   Jim  Eisenbrandt and Jim Flaherty argued persuasively that Plaintiffs should have to  respond to the personal jurisdiction discovery they had submitted, even if the  answers are that the plaintiffs don't have evidence to support jurisdiction over  individual defendants.   Judge Smith denied Sharp's motion for a  protective order that plaintiffs not have to respond to that  discovery.   He rejected Sharp's argument that it is not ""fair""  for plaintiffs to have to respond when the defendants have asserted  objections.   As with Sharp's questions, Judge Smith will review  the questions submitted by KCS and PSCo and identify those which the plaintiffs  must answer.   Dan Church will submit his separate discovery  served on the plaintiffs, since he asked some additional and different  questions.  
           4.   Discussion of Case Management Order
          In arguing  his motion, Sharp emphasized that with the passage of time and lack of  discovery he does not believe the CMO deadlines on the personal  jurisdiction motion can be met.  Later, off the record, after the  arguments, Sharp and Kerry McQueen ""apprised"" the Court that Mike Moore  cannot attend to this case due to the illness of his office manager, that Moore  cannot be deposed for the foreseeable future as a class representative, and that  Moore may have to reevaluate in about a month whether he even wants to  participate in this case (McQueen said if Moore does not want to participate  then he and Sharp will face some ""hard decisions""). 
         Though Sharp  reiterated, at points in his arguments, that he thinks the class certification  should proceed ahead of the personal jurisdiction factual motions because  the latter require discovery tantamount to merits discovery, he also seems  to want to delay class certification, but has been unclear in that respect.  
        There were no formal  proposals made to change the CMO, and no rulings to do so.  The Judge  indicated that if the parties agree to change the CMO deadlines and schedule, he  will not have a problem doing so, subject to him deciding the hearing  dates.  He wants the events calendared at all times to give him  management control over the case, but he is amenable to changing the time  lines. 
        I think both sides  will wait to see what the Judge says about the scope of ""limited personal  jurisdiction discovery,"" then re-evaluate how to proceed with CMO  negotiations.  It seems likely to me that we will get to the  hearing on the initial motion to dismiss without the discovery having  progressed far in substance.  It is not at all clear whether the  defendants will still want to, or be able to, continue pressing forward  with the personal jurisdiction motion (including undertaking needed discovery),  and a decision on same, before class certification.  Judge Smith still  seems to think that is the correct logical sequence for the case, but his  guidance on the discovery scope will be pivotal.  
            Don.

"In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters","
	Our number #1 priority for today is to get the petition filed in state court this afternoon.  We need to get Baytank served promptly thereafter.

	Also, I am in contact with Ted Rosen about getting an extension of the time for suit against Underwriters.  I think the better argument under Texas law is that we have four years to sue them, but there is some argument that it could be two years, so I am pursuing that as well today.

	I have not asked Philchem for an extension of time for suit against Philchem, nor do I believe we need one.  The Enron/Philchem Marketing Agreement contains a Texas choice-of-law clause.  Under Texas law, a breach of contract claim is governed by a four-year limitations period, absent a shorter contractual limitations period, which by statute cannot be shorter than two years.  However, there is no contractual limitations period in the Marketing Agreement.  So, Enron would have four years to file suit against Philchem.  All this is largely academic, of course, because another provision in the Enron/Philchem Marketing Agreement basically amounts to a waiver of subrogation against Philchem.

	The alleged one-year limitation period that confused Sharron West is a purported contractual limitations period/mandatory arbitration clause contained only in the Philchem/Baytank Terminalling Agreement.   I don't think that the one-year provision is good even against Philchem, and that Philchem probably has four years to commence arbitration against Baytank.

	Rosen has already sent to Sharron West a copy of our final statement of claim, with attached invoices.

	I will continue to keep you advised.

	Britt

- Only deal documentation will be released, not internal files etc. until further clarification is obtained from Houston.

- Paul will keep a log of what is produced to AA.

"New Temp IDs","Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

"AA Info","	On Friday, I talked with Derick Smith at AA about the status of my international cases for reporting purposes.  I mentioned that I was working on other non-international cases and he said that he didn't do the ""domestic"" stuff.  Is there anybody I need to talk to or anything I need to do vis-avis AA/ reporting in connection with my non-international stuff?  To the extent that Costilla and York are new matters and Sempra is set for trial in November, they come to mind.

> in a sub-investment grade rating, may entitle a counterparty to require
> Enron to provide additional credit in support of Enron's purchase
> obligations.  Counterparties should examine all power, gas or other
> commodity purchase and sale documentation to confirm whether they possess
> this right.  The failure to exercise this right may constitute a waiver
> and foreclose access to critical performance and payment assurance,
> threatening to alter the risk assessment and mitigation considerations
> upon which the transactions were originally based.  Furthermore, a failure

"Solicitation Calls","Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, ""I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?""

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Re: CPX - Response to PGE","We believe that a paragraph should be added objecting to the waiver of the Rule 26(a) and (f) requirements respecting ""Electric Generation Claims.""  Given PG&E's stated intention to object to market participants' claims, PG&E should not be exempted from nor should we be deprived of these mandatory disclosures.  Moreover, PG&E's concession that it will comply if ""ordered in connection with particular claim objections"" impermissibly puts the burden on market participants to seek an order mandating compliance on a claim-by-claim basis.

Where do we stand on the SCE stipulation?  I want to make sure that our push in SCE doesn't conflict or contradict something we are doing in the PG&E discussions.

"Information Request","Richard, following up on my voice mail of yesterday evening, I am
responsible for putting together the application that will be filed with
the court regarding retention of Weil Gotshal.  In connection therewith, we
must disclose to the court all potential conflicts between parties in
interest that are adverse to Enron who may also be clients of the Firm.

In that regard, I need the following information:

1.  A list of secured creditors of the potential debtor entities, broken
down by entity

2.  A list of landlords for each entity

3.  A list of outside law firms who perform significant work on behalf of
the potential debtors (broken down by entitiy, if possible).  I'll leave it
to your judgment what constitutes ""significant.""  We clearly don't want to
have to run through our conflicts system each and every law firm that you
employ.  I think the best way to draw the line would be law firms to which
you routinely pay more than $___ per month.  It may be that this number is
$50,000 or $100,000 or more.

4.  A current list of officers and directors for Enron Corp. (I have lists
for the other entities from another source).

5.  We have a list of 160 banks that are lenders to various of the Enron
entities.  Can you easily identify banks as to which the only relationship
is that Corp. has guaranteed an obligation of a non-debtor subsidiary?  If
so, that would be helpful information to have.

Wrap It Up with SNAP

SNAP's volunteer elves will again be taking over bookstores near you just in
time for the holidays!  Barnes and & Noble Stores as well as Borders Books
provide the paper.  We provide the smiles and paper cuts!  (Not too many
paper cuts!)  Here we go again, wrapping gifts for holiday shoppers at
selected locations all over Houston.

Calling all hands as all shifts are open to wrap gifts for tips!  And do we
mean tips!  Past experiences have earned SNAP as much as $1000 in a single
weekend at one store.  Three to four hour shifts ensure that this volunteer
opportunity won't spoil your holiday cheer.  In addition, volunteers will
receive a FREE ""We Wrap for Tips"" t-shirt!  
 
For store locations and times & to sign-up online go to
www.snaptx.org/volunteer/giftwrapping

If wrapping is not your ""bag"" then you can help by donating bows and
ribbons.  The prettier the packages...the better the tips!!  Just drop them
off at the Wellness Clinic and we will make those presents beautiful for the
animals!

"FW: Broadband litigation work","Michelle, I have talked to Steven Sheldon, Martin Sacchi, and soon to talk to Marc Hensel and Ed Smida as well as Michele Nezi Marvin re: broadband litigation support work.  Luckily for the effort, I think all of these people, with the exception of Steven have a longer term position at broadband or elsewhere at Enron.  If this group of people or some subset thereof remains at Enron then I think we can get good litigation services from them re: broadband claims.  Call me if you have any questions.  Sherron.

(as the neutral) a case between Duke and Exxon.  Charles Renfrew was Duke's
arbitrator-- apparently they use him in anything and everything.

"RE: CalPx CEO Candidate Resumes","Folks: I am sending at Howard's request.  The Search Subcommittee (Rich
Stevens, Howard, and myself) has performed the initial screening, and
concluded that Coffman, Jermaine, and Robert Mosier deserve your serious
attention on Friday after the weekly OCPC meeting.  Shirmoammadi, Rodriguez,
and Pope did not make the cut.
The plan is to conclude the OCPC meeting no later than 12:00 Friday, take a
short 30 minute break to get organized and allow telephone attendees to get
a quick bite to eat, and resume at 12:30 with three quick-hitting,
action-packed 45 minute interviews of Coffman, Jermaine, and Mosier.  I am
attaching a scoring template to aid your note-taking and deliberations.  It
is our intention to make a decision on Friday afternoon that will result in
a firm offer going out.
Mosier was a late entrant, and his resume is available for your inspection
at his work-out company website www.mosierco.com.  Mosier may be on travel
on Friday, necessitating a call-in to the Committee.
The Search Subcommittee would be grateful if you could arrange your schedule
on Friday afternoon to permit your active participation in the interviews
and deliberations.
Marc: could you have your staff set-up and reserve a second conference call
beginning at 12:30?  Thanks- jim crossen, APX

Michelle, I have talked to Steven Sheldon, Martin Sacchi, and soon to talk to Marc Hensel and Ed Smida as well as Michele Nezi Marvin re: broadband litigation support work.  Luckily for the effort, I think all of these people, with the exception of Steven have a longer term position at broadband or elsewhere at Enron.  If this group of people or some subset thereof remains at Enron then I think we can get good litigation services from them re: broadband claims.  Call me if you have any questions.  Sherron.

Michele - I have not yet gotten a hold of the 2 individuals I'd like to work with on this.  Mark H. had asked me not speak to them until after I'd met with Richard Sanders.  At any rate, I should be able to speak to them next week and get their names to you - I want to ensure that they want to work on the project.  I'll be in touch as soon as possible next week.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Post BR petiition scheduling by East Wholesale Power","Following up on Elizabeth Sager's conversation with you Corry as to terminated wholesale power contracts and related matters, and based also on EPMI's obligation to preserve assets for the bankruptcy estate, EAST Wholesale Power's scheduling of energy receipts and deliveries in Cinergy, ComEd, PJM, Entergy and NEPOOL and any other eastern markets should be halted following the close of business today, excepting those scheduling activities in NEPOOL required in order to perform the contracts in effect between EPMI and UI, NSTAR, Central Maine, and Vermont, respectively.  

If explanation is requested by our upstream counterparties, please respond that we are unable to receive due to the actions of our downstream parties (e.g., they're not taking, so we are unable to take).  If explanation is requested by downstream counterparties, please respond that we are unable to supply due to the actions of our upstream parties (e.g., they're not delivering, so we're not able to deliver).  Please contact me or Elizabeth Sager if there are questions relating to this change in our scheduling activities.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""
