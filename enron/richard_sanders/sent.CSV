   I assume that you are in charge of the finalizing of the repository

   and that you will be in touch with the folks at the building regarding

	Richard,

	This will acknowledge receipt today of and thank you for the above-referenced new matter and accompanying file.  I have reviewed that file and spoken about it with Stacy.  In brief, this is an as-yet-unfiled claim for breach of a gas supply contract and $336,832.17 in damages by the seller, Franklin Adkins, against ENA, as the buyer.  

	Adkins' claim is based on breach of an index price contract that had been assigned to ENA from Columbia Energy Services Corporation.  ENA contends that this index price contract had been terminated and replaced with a ENA Enfolio fixed price contract, and that ENA accordingly owes Adkins nothing.  All this is, of course, subject to further investigation, including whether ENA may have a counterclaim against Adkins for overpayment.

	I will contact the key witnesses tomorrow and find out as much as I can about the matter before speaking with Adkin's attorney on Friday at 9:30 a.m.  Please let me know who else I should be reporting to besides you and Stacy.  I assume that you will be handling this, rather than Andy Edison, unless you instruct me otherwise.

	As always, I appreciate the referral and the chance to work with you and Stacy.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Multiple MOU Plans Debated
California State Budget Faces One Last Hurdle

Budget 
There is a small possibility that Sen. Burton will not recess the Senate on Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last night (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in Italy and is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told to return and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed to pass any urgency measure for the budget.  Kuehl's vote is crucial if they take the bill up on Thursday. 
MOU Mayhem
There are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by the California House and Senate deliberations.  Senator Burton is hoping to keep the published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening.  Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison issue is resolved.  However, rumor is that whether or not they recess on Thursday, their adjournment will mark the end of the Second Extraordinary session and all XX  bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days (all others will be dead).  Although Davis has stressed the urgency of passing a comprehensive ""bail-out"" plan and even threatened to call an emergency session to prevent legislators from taking a 30-day recess on Friday, there is no clear indication that legislators will comply with this request.      
Hertzberg's bill 82XX - Of the more obvious differences from Davis MOU,  82XX proposes to offer SoCal $300 M less for its transmission lines in addition to penalizing Edison if it fails to act in good faith in closing the deal.  It comes as no surprise that during bill deliberations, SoCal raised objections to the bill and warned of impending difficulties (bankruptcy) for So Cal were the bill left unamended.
The Wright-Richman bill 83XX - We reported last week that 83XX remains the only measure fueled by bipartisan support.  AB 83XX was heard in an ""informational"" hearing yesterday (7-17) and will be heard again today in the Assembly Energy Committee.  Assemblyman Rod Wright, the Chairman of the Committee, presented AB 83xx with Dr. Keith Richman, a Republican Assemblyman from Southern California. They offered 83XX as an Edison bail-out, pure and simple. Wright was clear to distinguish his bill from 82XX, which he said has conservation easements and land requisitions, a renewable portfolio which will add an additional fee on ratepayers, and reasonable review for long term contracts. While the chances of the Richman bill being successful appear slim, reports that that Hertzberg will try to negotiate elements of his own bill (82XX) as amendments to the Wright/Richman measure suggest that at least Hertzberg feels Richman's 83XX stands a chance. 

The Byron Sher bill, SB 78XX (Polanco) - Previously presented by Sen. Polanco on behalf of Governor Davis, SB 78XX has received special attention from Senate President, John Burton.  Although it has never been heard by a committee, SB 78XX is currently on the Senate floor and ready for a vote. The Senate Energy Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee are both scheduled to have informational hearings on this bill today.  Note, the meetings are informational because neither committee has possession of the bill.  These hearings will provide information to committee members, avoid a formal vote, and simultaneously shield Burton/Polanco from claims that the details of SB78XX were never released.  The Senate is scheduled to be in session tomorrow, ostensibly to vote on the state budget and SB 78XX. Given Burton's penchant for wanting to keep on schedule to recess tomorrow, there is no guarantee that he will hold the Senate in session once they hear SB 78XX. Thus, the Senate may never even see AB 82XX and AB 83XX unless either or both bills are passed out of the Assembly today and get special treatment by Burton to be heard tomorrow. Burton has previously adjourned the Senate to keep on schedule once they finish their business, even if the Assembly is behind them.

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the
preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will
allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY
FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Subject:	Mr X?s situation




Dear Richard, 

As requested, please find hereinbelow the different sections of Law No. 25,188 of Public Ethics (PEL) and of our criminal code (CC) that could be in play in this matter.

Please notice that we have recently discovered through our criminal lawyer the unpublished opinion of the Anticorruption Office dlivered at the enquiry of the Secretary of Communications. Some of the ideas therein expressed could benefit Mr. X in case than a specific investigation or challenge is made. We will work in a memo to illustrate on the matter.

Section 13, PEL: It is incompatible with public office: 

a) to manage, administer, represent, sponsor, provide any advise, or, by any other means, render services to any person that negotiates or has a concession or is a supplier of the State or performs activities regulated by the same, so long as the relevant public office position has a direct competence with respect to the engagement, achievement, negotiation or control of such concessions, benefits or activities;

b) to be a supplier, either on its behalf or on behalf of a third party, of any State body where the relevant person is an officer.

Section 15, PEL: If at the moment of his appointment, the public officer is held to be within any of the incompatibilities mentioned in Section 13, he must:

a) resign to such activities as a condition precedent to assuming the position. 

b) refrain himself from intervening, during the performance of his duties as an officer, in matters related to the persons with whom or issues in which he were connected with for the past three (3) years or where he has a corporate participation.

In such circumstances, those acts could be considered null and void and generate the responsibility mentioned in section 17 of the abovementioned law that provides:

Section 17, PEL: Notwithstanding the rights of any third party acting in good faith, in the event that the acts performed by the persons comprised in Section 1 are within the scope of Sections 13, 14 and 15, the same shall be absolutely invalid and void. In case of the issuance of an administrative act, such acts shall be absolutely invalid and void pursuant to the terms of Section 14 of law No. 19,549.

The concession companies or other counter parties shall be severally liable for any damages caused to the State by these acts.

Section 173, CC: 

Fraudulent administration 

Notwithstanding the general provision of the above-mentioned Section, the following shall be considered special cases of fraud and shall be subject to the penalties established therein[prison of one month to six years]: 

...7) who, due to any applicable law, authority or legal act, is in charge of the management, administration or care of assets or economic interests belonging to a third party, with the purpose of seeking on its behalf or on behalf of a third party an illegal profit or of causing damage, infringes the duty of care, damaging the entrusted interests or illegitimately forces the owner of the same;...

Section 256, CC: 

Passive Corruption 

The public officer who, on its behalf or through any third party, receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and perpetual disqualification to hold a public position.

Section 256 (bis), CC: 

Influence peddling 

Who, on its behalf or through any third party, asks for or receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to illegally influence a public officer so as to make the latter act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position..

Section 258, CC: 

Active Corruption 

Who, direct or indirectly, grants or offers benefits seeking any of the behaviours referred in  articles 256 and 256 (bis), first paragraph, shall be punished with prison from one to six years. If the grant was made or offered to obtain any of the referred behaviours by articles 256 bis, second paragraph and 257, the punishment will be of prison from two to six years. If it was a public officer, he will be punished with special disqualification from two to six years in the first case and from three to ten years in the second one.

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation
	Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

	Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan. 

	The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB).

	In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's withdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.  The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan. 

	Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Other Contingencies
	Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

	Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

	Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for wholesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in available hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-reliance on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California's regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power costs and certain obligations related to the difference between third party power purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and SCE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstanding obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange (the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System Operator (the Independent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.

	Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situation in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initiatives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not possible to predict their outcome at this time.

	Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utilities, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energy in California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of these entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

	India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol Power Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constructing an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasification facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the guarantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The contract disputes relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documents and (b) MSEB's statements that MSEB has ""rescinded"" the PPA and MSEB is therefore no longer bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Phase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts for non-payment.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actions are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pursue all available legal remedies under the project documents.  As a result of these disputes, the 740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by MSEB.  Further, Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II.  Enron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

Nevertheless, with the view that it is easier to take out than add, I have restated some points.

Hi Sheila, 

My partner Donn Pickett has been trying to get Richard Sanders to sign off on the attached conflicts letter concerning our representation of Reliant in the litigation in California in which Enron is also involved.  I understand the letter confirms prior conversations between Richard and Donn.  Karen suggested that, because you see Richard frequently, maybe we could enlist your help in getting the paperwork processed.  We would greatly appreciate that.

I hope all is going well for you and your family.  Let me know if you have any questions.

"RE: Trial Lawyer","I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week?

Jamie's bio says that his area of practice is antitrust and business
litigation,particularly concentrated on industries

ABA Antitrust Section from 94-97.

When are you in town, so we can have dinner?

Soojin, it appears we will need to postpone the training.  While this is not related to yesterday's events, I am in the middle of a major crisis involving one of our projects in Brazil and have been asked not to come to Korea until it is resolved.  I will be sending the materials, the presentation and the new policy by email and will contact Mr. Kinder about rescheduling.  I know there was some urgency in having this training before the end of September, and perhaps you can forward the materials and power point on to those who were to attend for their review in the meantime.

I apologize for the delay in responding, but I hoped we could get this resolved in time for my trip to Korea, but unfortunately some things are beyond our control.  I appreciate your diligence in trying to make these arrangements for me.

Anthony,  I just spoke with Michelle Blaine's assistant.  Michelle is planning to be in Korea the week of September 17th and would like to conduct the training sometime during that Monday to Thursday.  I will let you know when the date is confirmed.
 
Also, are you having a regional meeting in Singapore this fall?  I thought it might be a good chance for Michelle to present the FCPA training to the whole group.  The presentation takes one hour.  We are making an effort to provide the training to EBS before year-end, so it would be great to have the Asia region trained as well.  
 
Please let me know what you think.  Thank you, Michelle

	This is another example of litigation involving NEPCO about which 'the litigation group' (me) knew nothing.  I assume David obtained Derrick's approval for counsel (he usually does) but I still wonder what other matters are hiding under the rug that we don't know about.
	Last time we discussed this you mentioned that you wanted us involved in their litigation the same way we would be involved if they were here. Accordingly, should I talk to Dave and find out what else is out there?  This deal is very similar to the last situation wherein NEPCO had filed an arbitration and we didn't find out about it until well after the thing was under way.

Gail,  

I think you are referring to a case between the Oklahoma Dept. of Health and
NEPCO, and yes I have it.  Steve Jantzen of McKinney and Stringer in
Oklahoma City was retained early on when the threat of litigation was
evident.  There was actually an earlier case filed but improperly served on
NEPCO so the court dismissed it.  This is a new case  and repeat of the old
case which has now been properly served on NEPCO.  The case will be stayed
pursuant to a Consent Decree that is being negotiated by NEPCO with the
Dept. of Health concerning compliance with the correct ratio of apprentices
to licensed electricians on the Jenks, OK jobsite.   In fact, this issue
will be moot soon as the project is near completion and all matters of
compliance will be non existent when the workforce is released later this
month.

On the other case for a $2800 collection matter, that is being handled by
Bonnie White and set to be dismissed by the plaintiff on agreement by NEPCO
to pay a compromised amount.  This case should never have happened expect
for the fact that a forwarding address from a closed office in California
never properly forwarded the claimant's invoices to NEPCO

JOINT DEFENSE

I spoke today with Sweetwater's counsel, Rob Hanna of Best, Best & Krieger.
Two items to report:

	1.   Judge Sammartino.  Hanna alerted me to an article in the recent
San Diego Lawyer  (see attached).  The article concerns the ""M (for
Motherhood) Group,"" a group of 10 San Diego women lawyers that have met
twice a week for the past 21 years.  Judge Sammartino is a member of the
group, as are two lawyers in Hanna's firm - Arelene Prater and Tina Dyer.
Hanna said he wanted defendants to be aware the relationship between the BBK
lawyers and Sammartino.  Hanna said he has no plans to challenge Judge
Sammartino, but wanted defense lawyers to be alerted to the issue.  Unless
someone has a different suggestion, let's factor this into the mix when we
revisit the coordination issues next week.

	2.  Case Management Hearing.  Hanna reported that his office had
contacted Judge Hayes' clerk to ask whether the CMC hearing (set for 9/28 in
Sweetwater) would be going forward. Hanna's office was told the CMC would
remain on calendar.  Hanna and I jointly called Judge Hayes' Court Clerk,
David Lim, to follow up.  Mr. Lim confirmed that, notwithstanding the
assignment order to Judge Sammartino,  Judge Hayes wants the parties to
provide a status report at the CMC.  He confirmed that the Court wants the
parties to file CMC questionnaires, although he suggested that the Court is
probably most interested in the coordination status.  The CMC questionnaire
is due Friday, Sept. 21 (although Mr. Lim said we could filed anytime prior
to Thursday noon (Sept 27).  Given that Judge Hayes appreciates strict
compliance with the local rules, I suggest we file this Friday.   We will
prepare a proposed joint CMC statement for all defendants and circulate the
same tomorrow.

        I have scheduled an all day meeting with Greg and Chris, in New York, on Friday, September 21, 2001. At this meeting wwe will discuss the trial plan and, in effect, have a dry run of what we might expect to occur during the October 11 trial.  Please let me know if you are available to attend. I have also asked that, by the end of this week, Brobeck provide us with a summary of the best arguments for and against both sides and an analysis of the realistic exposure to both sides. We can review this before the meeting on the 21st. 

        Also, the two motions for summary judgment we filed are set to be heard on October 1, 2001. The outcome of this hearing (assuming the judge makes a ruling) could certainly affect the tone and scope of the case. Please let me know if you are available on the 21st.  Thanks.

Subject:	Mr X?s situation


Dear Richard, 
As requested, please find hereinbelow the different sections of Law No. 25,188 of Public Ethics (PEL) and of our criminal code (CC) that could be in play in this matter.
Please notice that we have recently discovered through our criminal lawyer the unpublished opinion of the Anticorruption Office dlivered at the enquiry of the Secretary of Communications. Some of the ideas therein expressed could benefit Mr. X in case than a specific investigation or challenge is made. We will work in a memo to illustrate on the matter.
Section 13, PEL: It is incompatible with public office: 
a) to manage, administer, represent, sponsor, provide any advise, or, by any other means, render services to any person that negotiates or has a concession or is a supplier of the State or performs activities regulated by the same, so long as the relevant public office position has a direct competence with respect to the engagement, achievement, negotiation or control of such concessions, benefits or activities;
b) to be a supplier, either on its behalf or on behalf of a third party, of any State body where the relevant person is an officer.
Section 15, PEL: If at the moment of his appointment, the public officer is held to be within any of the incompatibilities mentioned in Section 13, he must:
a) resign to such activities as a condition precedent to assuming the position. 
b) refrain himself from intervening, during the performance of his duties as an officer, in matters related to the persons with whom or issues in which he were connected with for the past three (3) years or where he has a corporate participation.
In such circumstances, those acts could be considered null and void and generate the responsibility mentioned in section 17 of the abovementioned law that provides:
Section 17, PEL: Notwithstanding the rights of any third party acting in good faith, in the event that the acts performed by the persons comprised in Section 1 are within the scope of Sections 13, 14 and 15, the same shall be absolutely invalid and void. In case of the issuance of an administrative act, such acts shall be absolutely invalid and void pursuant to the terms of Section 14 of law No. 19,549.
The concession companies or other counter parties shall be severally liable for any damages caused to the State by these acts.
Section 173, CC: 
Fraudulent administration 
Notwithstanding the general provision of the above-mentioned Section, the following shall be considered special cases of fraud and shall be subject to the penalties established therein[prison of one month to six years]: 
...7) who, due to any applicable law, authority or legal act, is in charge of the management, administration or care of assets or economic interests belonging to a third party, with the purpose of seeking on its behalf or on behalf of a third party an illegal profit or of causing damage, infringes the duty of care, damaging the entrusted interests or illegitimately forces the owner of the same;...
Section 256, CC: 
Passive Corruption 
The public officer who, on its behalf or through any third party, receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and perpetual disqualification to hold a public position.
Section 256 (bis), CC: 
Influence peddling 
Who, on its behalf or through any third party, asks for or receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to illegally influence a public officer so as to make the latter act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position..
Section 258, CC: 
Active Corruption 
Who, direct or indirectly, grants or offers benefits seeking any of the behaviours referred in  articles 256 and 256 (bis), first paragraph, shall be punished with prison from one to six years. If the grant was made or offered to obtain any of the referred behaviours by articles 256 bis, second paragraph and 257, the punishment will be of prison from two to six years. If it was a public officer, he will be punished with special disqualification from two to six years in the first case and from three to ten years in the second one.
Section 258 (bis), CC: 
Influence peddling 
Who grants or offers to a public officer of another State, direct or indirectly, any  value or other benefits as donations, favours, promises or advantages, in order to illegally influence him so as to make, as exchange, the latter act or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office related to any transaction of economic or commercial nature, shall be punished with confinement from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position.
Section 268 (3), CC: 
Affidavit Omission or Falsification 
Who, under law and in view of its position, is required to file a patrimonial affidavit and maliciously omits to do so, shall be punished with prison from fifteen days to two years and perpetual disqualification.
The violation shall be deemed such when, upon sufficient notification demanding compliance, the relevant person fails to comply with the requested obligations within the terms foreseen by applicable laws.
The same penalty shall be applicable to anyone who maliciously falsifies or omits to include in the referred affidavits any data or information that is required to be included in accordance with any applicable law and regulations.
Do not hesitate in contacting us should you need any further clarificaction.

Subject:	PX Committee call

In today's call we addressed the usual issues.  This Friday the complex litigation panel will decide whether to consolidate the commandeering suits.  In case you hadn't noticed, the state filed a declaratory relief action in Sacramento naming each of the individual participants but not the PX.  The state's alleged fear is that it might be exposed to double recovery to the PX and the individual participants, so it asks for a declaration of its exposure to the participants.  The new complaint has not yet been served.  Our counsel who are trying to keep matters simple are considering strategies that will avoid the need for each participant to respond, and we should have some recommendation next week.  Next, Howard Weg will circulate a draft motion to FERC submitting his proposed settlement.  We should have the draft within the next week.  Next, a subcommittee met with PG&E reps last week to get a preview of a possible reorganization plan.  Weg may call Michael Tribolet to get his take on plan structure.  Next, the state Senate evidently balked at the Edison bailout.  Reliant and Marant have not filed a petition and are considering their options in view of the possibility that the governor will call the legislature back into special session in early October.  In the meantime, Edison is producing documents in response to the 2004 notice.  Weg raised a question about whether Enron will be filing an administrative claim in the PG&E case pursuant to court order in that case.  I wasn't aware of the issue.  Are you?  There were productive plan discussions with PX representatives as to structure and tasks of the PX going forward, and we are expecting a proposal momentarily.  Discussions with the Trade Creditors Committee still haven't reached closure.  PX reps evidently will be approaching PG&E and Edison to share the cost of future operations.  Our next committee call is Sept. 26 at 2.  We still need to talk about the funding issue when you have a moment.  Bob

I have received an invoice from the Rockets for next season's tickets. The
total amount is $19,712.00, or $112 per seat. According to the Rockets,
there will be no increase for this season or the 2002/2003 season (but wait
until the new arena is built in 2003!). The breakdown is as follows:
Bill Gage (25%): $4928 (less $736 previously paid);
Bob Roten (25%): $4928;
Glenn Ballard (12.5%): $2464;
Pat Doherty (12.5%): $2464;
Richard Sanders (12.5%): $2464; and
Bill Eggleston (12.5%): $2464.

Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success

depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our 
bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation 
which McCook have forced on us. 
  
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for 
comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day 
period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my 
calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent

HOUSTON, Aug. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news) believes that it is necessary to respond to continuing mischaracterizations and inaccurate press reports regarding the recently completed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hearing in which it participated. This distorted coverage has fostered unwarranted fears in the marketplace fueled by misunderstandings about the nature of the FERC proceeding, the testimony and evidence presented, and the applicable regulatory standards.

``I am very concerned that the investing public has been misled by recent reports describing the current state of a FERC proceeding and quoting comments made by the presiding FERC administrative law judge,'' said William A. Wise, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of El Paso Corporation. ``These reports have seriously mischaracterized El Paso's actions and the legal standards by which those actions must be measured. I am confident that once the facts are fairly evaluated and the appropriate legal standards are applied, El Paso will be vindicated. Despite the heated rhetoric by the complaining parties and comments by the administrative law judge himself, El Paso believes as a matter of law and fact that the complaining parties have not met their burden of proof and no burdens of proof have shifted. No other legally sustainable conclusion can be reached.''

The following facts are necessary to a complete and accurate understanding of this administrative proceeding. In April 2000, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) filed a complaint with the FERC, alleging that El Paso Natural Gas Company (EPNG) improperly awarded capacity on its pipeline to an affiliated energy marketing company, El Paso Merchant Energy (EPME). It was also alleged that EPME had improperly been granted a discount on the Mojave pipeline system in violation of the FERC's marketing affiliate rules and had unlawfully exercised market power. For almost a year thereafter, FERC reviewed and evaluated comments submitted by all parties and extensive evidence and documents that El Paso produced. On March 28, 2001, the FERC issued an order based on this evidence that addressed all three issues.

With respect to the CPUC's allegations regarding violations of the affiliate regulations, FERC ruled, in an unanimous decision, that:

The current El Paso contracts were awarded following an open season that

was conducted in accordance with Commission rules and policies. The

Commission finds no merit in the allegations that the bidding process ...

was skewed to favor El Paso Merchant and that El Paso Merchant possessed

certain information concerning a discount that was not available to other

bidders. Further, the Commission has examined the evidence and does not

find a violation of the Standards of Conduct for Interstate Pipelines

with Marketing Affiliates.

That same order specifically discussed the very telephone transcripts that have been the subject of recent press coverage. Notwithstanding certain public observations of the administrative law judge in the current hearing, the Commission unanimously concluded that ``the transcripts do not indicate that Mojave's Transportation Marketing Negotiator agreed to the tiered arrangement sought by El Paso Merchant Energy.'' That order unequivocally held that the conversation reported in the transcripts is not an affiliate standard violation, concluding that under the marketing affiliate regulations, ``Mojave was under no obligation to post affiliate discount information until the time at which gas first flowed under the transaction.''

The market power issues were set for an evidentiary hearing, which commenced on May 14, 2001, and concluded in June.

On June 11, 2001, the FERC granted rehearing of its March decision solely to resolve any factual issues raised by the allegations of the CPUC's complaint concerning affiliate abuse and violation of the FERC's Standards of Conduct. That hearing commenced on August 2 and concluded on August 6. EPNG, EPME, and the CPUC each called one witness to testify on these issues. The CPUC presented no new facts or evidence and relied solely on the same documents that the unanimous Commission had ruled failed to prove any of the alleged affiliate violations.

Since the FERC's unanimous March 28 decision was rendered on the basis of the same facts that are now a part of the evidentiary record before the judge, there should be no legal basis for the Commission to change that decision when the case returns to it.

``Contrary to press reports, El Paso's senior executives did not refuse to appear at the hearing,'' said Mr. Wise. ``The judge requested that some executives be available to answer his questions, and El Paso made them available for that purpose. At the appropriate time, El Paso raised several legal objections to any further El Paso witnesses being required to testify. Contrary to press reports, the judge agreed with El Paso's arguments and there was no further questioning of the executives. The hearing then concluded.''

The evidence in the hearing also establishes that there is no basis for the allegations of market power abuse. During the period from June 2000 to March 2001, when the price of natural gas in California was sharply increasing, pipeline capacity was plainly not being withheld from the marketplace. Instead, the evidence demonstrates that during this crucial period, 95 percent of the available capacity on EPNG's pipeline was being utilized. In fact, on many days utilization by EPNG's customers amounted to 100 percent of the pipeline's available capacity. During the same period, EPNG's customers utilized approximately 97 percent of the pipeline's available capacity into southern California, the region where the complaining parties allege that prices were significantly higher than in the rest of California. Thus, the objective data conclusively demonstrate that at the times when the complaining parties allege that pipeline capacity was used to manipulate natural gas prices, the capacity on EPNG's pipeline was not being withheld, and that the high natural gas prices were clearly caused by other factors now widely recognized to be responsible for the shortages experienced.

All briefs in the proceeding must be filed by September 7, 2001, and the judge has stated he will issue his proposed decision by October 9, 2001. In the event that the judge reaches a decision adverse to El Paso on the market power issue, or reaches a different conclusion on the affiliate issues than was reached by the full Commission in March 2001, El Paso will appeal the decision to the full Commission and, if necessary thereafter, the courts.

``I am confident that, when appropriate legal standards are applied to this case, we will be vindicated. The law and the facts are on our side,'' said Mr. Wise.

Hello!

It was nice to see you at the POS event last week.  I can't believe that
we're into a new school year. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch; we did a
fair amount of traveling this summer and now I'm over my head preparing for
a trial that begins mid-October.

I assume/hope that you did receive a payment from the PCA trustee on
account of EPMI's allowed claim.  If you didn't, shame on me for not
following up.  If you need me to, please just let me know.

The only other open matter I have for ENA is in the Perry Gas case in which
ENA filed a proof of claim in the amount of about $1,918,000.  A plan of
liquidation has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the anticipated
(not guaranteed) payout over time is expected to be in the 55-60% range.
The post-confirmation trustee is in the process of reconciling claims.

From the email below sent to my from the post-liquidation trustee's counsel
(who was also counsel to Perry Gas during the bankruptcy case), it appears
that the trustee's accounting people have been talking to Willie Stewart in
accounting at ENA to try to reconcile the slightly different numbers.

From what I understand, Willie Stewart and Perry agree that, with the
exception of $78,337.16 that ENA owed Perry  for August 1999 deliveries,
the amount of the prepetition claim is $1,903,490.72.   Provided that there
is no disagreement about the amount of unpaid sales from Perry to ENA for
August 1999, the $78,337.16 should be offset against the $1,903,490.72
claim, which would leave ENA with a prepetition claim of $1,825,153.56.

I would be happy to deal directly with Willie on this if you'd like -- just
let me know.  If Willie agrees with the $78,337.16 amount due to Perry for
August 1999, do I have authority to agree to the prepetition claim of
$1,825,153.56?  Perry has made one distribution and I'll get the commitment
up front that as soon as the agreed order allowing ENA's claim, Perry will
cut a check for the first distribution.

If my case settles, I'll give you a call to set up a lunch.  I'd like to
get caught up.  Thanks and take care.

Who is Rad?  This is Lodi's application to itself for approval to use the plant site for a generating plant?  If the AG office wants to see it, I have trouble imagining a harmless reason:  I almost wonder if the AG is interested in whether the city would have legal authority to both apply and approve.  But somebody would have had to arouse the state's interest; who would do that?  PG&E?

If the application is a public document, then the state could easily get it anyway, so it's OK to send it, but why wouldn't the state have asked the city for it?

Howard,

My partner Steve Susman forwarded me a copy of your email to him.  Our firm
looks forward to meeting with your committee on Wednesday.  While I had
planned to attend when the interview was scheduled for last Thursday, I
cannot come this week because I am starting trial in Chicago.  I am not sure
yet who from our firm will be attending, but can assure you that we are very
interested in the case.  Whether by ourselves or jointly with Marshall
Grossman and his firm, we think this sort of lawsuit is right up our alley.
We know how to get a complex commercial dispute ready for trial, maximize
its settlement value, or try it successfully if necessary.

I'll try to give you a call Monday or Tuesday to let you know who else from
our firm will be joining Marc Seltzer, who heads our LA office, at the

Subject: Houston Pipe Line Company v. Kinney Fitzgerald charges - Enron Litigation Unit


Richard, I have had a request from Denise LaGesse (at Lou's request) to remove the Enron Litigation Unit charges on this matter from their operating company (ETS) and charge them to ENA instead.  We have billed ETS 5 times since January, the total amount of the billings being $4,678.47.  If you are in agreement with this transfer of charges, please provide the company # and cost center # that you would like me to have them transferred to.  I can forward details of these billings to you by fax or mail.  Let me know your preference.  Thank you.
 
Denise, I will need your company # and cost center # as well.
 
Thank you.

I have talked with Ken Krissa and have placed a couple of calls to Jesus.  In short, there is no conference call set for today; however, Jesus has brought back with him (from Cresendo's offices) copies of all the correspondence between Cresendo and Rocky Mountain Helium.  These documents also contain an opinion letter from Cresendo's outside counsel, Bill Ward, at Pruitt, Gushee and Bachtell.  I've also learned that ENA owns about 85-90% of Cresendo with the remainder being owned by NG Resources (a BCCK Engineering entity) and Cresendo Energy Partners.  Cresendo Energy Partners is owned by Ken Krissa and another guy and is the managing member of the LLC.  I'm getting a copy of the LLC agreeemnt .
I'll keep you posted.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Potential dispute with Dynegy
Importance:	High

Mark/Richard

We are looking at a possible dispute with Dynegy in relation a UK electricity trading contract.

Part of our assessment of whether we want to resolve the issue by expert determination rather than by compromise is going to be driven by the extent to which we feel we need to make the point to Dynegy that we are prepared to square up for a fight when we need to and not compromise.

In making this assessment our relationship with Dynegy in the US (and elsewhere) - in particular whether we have or have had any/many disputes with Dynegy - will be very instructive.

Please could you drop me a quick email or vmail with a thumb-nail sketch of any current and past disputes with Dynegy.

Many thanks

Paul

I think we need to have a conference call for everyone to select playoff
tickets.  Please get back to me with your availalbity.  I think the
concensous is we draw number 1 to 9.  Number 1 picks first etc.  Number 9
would then choose first in the second round etc.  The people persons picking
would have fist choice on what games you want to choose.  We have 30 total
slots, 2 tickets for the first two rounds for each game (total of 14 slots),
and 1 ticket for each world series game (16 slots).  See attached spread

I think I mentioned this before to you. Dave Noonan and I jointly own a 3 bedroom condo in Park City, Utah. If you and your wife, with or without kids, want to get away for a break(and remain beyond the California borders), you are welcome to use it. It sits vacant most of the time.

Ken Gross's assistant has sent me their proposed draft of the document that Skadden would submit to the New Jersey AG in connection with the investigation of Enron's political contributions in the state during 1999.  I would appreciate your careful review of this material, and I also request that you get any comments back to me by end of day on Monday, July 9.  If we need to meet face-to-facer on this, I am in town and available. 

If you feel I have forgotten anyone on the distribution list, please let me know.  Many thanks!

I just participated in a conference call of the PX committee.  Our counsel
are urging the committee to clear them to commence an arbitration action to
recover the PX's claim against SCE.  This may be followed by a judicial
action seeking prejudgment relief in the form of an attachment.  A written
memo will be circulated shortly to the committee summarizing this course of
action.  The view seems to be that SCE has all but assured that it will be
suing PX and all the participants, and why not take the initiative.  Any
thoughts?

While it appears that we received the articles addressing indemnity, they reference other sections and articles of the agreement that we did not receive and are necessary for Eileen's review.

We did not learn of this tentative until after 4:30 today, although it was
probably posted sometime earlier in the afternoon.  The local rule states
that a party who wishes to argue the tentative shall notify opposing counsel
before 4:30. We called their attorneys after 4:30, but before 5 PM. I
reached Martin Goyette, counsel for the AG personally by phone shortly after
five, and notified him of our intention to argue. He claimed the AG would
not appear to argue given late notice. I have notified him by fax of our
intention to argue.

I think we can put together a list of major topics that need clarification/discussion w/SDI, so those attending the meeting can deliver the message, if appropriate.  I suggest we (TD) take a shot at the first draft and circulate it later today.  Any other suggestions are welcome.

Thanks Lou. 
 
After the meetings on 8/16-17, we should have a much clearer path to follow regarding SDI and Trico. 
 
I am anticipating that very soon after 8/16-17, we will be working closely in conjunction with SDI to develop a joint proposal.  Part of the discussion on 8/16-17 will be exclusivity, responsibilities, and resource allocation. All of these assumptions, of course, are dependent upon a positive response from SDI, and to date, there has been nothing to indicate that we wouldn't receive a positive response.

Trico update: 

I spoke with CSFB and told them that we are not at this time prepared to accelerate our bid process in keeping with their request earlier today to complete our due diligence this week and mark up the contract.

They will still provide us the opportunity to visit the data room and will also still forward us a copy of the contract.  But they will proceed with the other party on the accelerated timeline as a stalking horse bidder.  

The big unknown is will we be able to develop a structure with SDI that works and is quick  enough to participate in the final round of bids.

Enrique and/or Javier, 

please forward copy of Trico bid to Lou. 

Lou, latest information from Jeff McMahon via Tim B is that we will not agree to the accellerated pace as offered by CSFB. We will be meeting with SDI on the 16th and 17th to discuss a joint approach to the assets and most likely to prepare for our response during the 20 day pre-auction date.

We will keep you informed as events further develop.  ANy advice/information from Bracewell regarding the bidding process and whether CSFB's proposed accelerated timeline can even be met?

Thanks, 

Tim

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
SoCal Conference Call Highlights

SoCal Conference Call- The following comments are notes from the SoCal conference call for defaulted debt holders, held 1:30 p.m. PDT, 13 July 2001:

Ted Kravner, the SoCal spokesperson, indicated that there are ""a lot of bills floating around.  There's not a lot for us to say at this point.""  After such a long delay, he stated that, ""We are encouraged to see real action at the legislative level.""  Also, the company could not comment as to whether the plans made the utility creditworthy; ""We are evaluating that with Senate and Assembly leaders.""

The spokesperson stated that on Monday the company will make a regular interest payments on the 5 7/8 notes totaling less than $6 M.  The company will also make payments on its other notes; the total amount to be paid will be $27 to $28 M.

Yesterday the CPUC granted the company's motion on the QF fixed rate agreement with the gas cogen and renewable QFs.  The spokesperson stated that the PUC said SoCal can recover all costs associated with its payments to these QFs.


	Appalucia Management Questions to SoCal
	Q:  	Will SCE defer payment on the ""quids"" notes, which are backed by a trust that has bonds issued against it?
	A: 	Under the terms of the notes SoCal is allowed to defer payment for up to 20 quarters.

	Q:	Would the CPUC, after providing for the DWR to be reimbursed for purchasing power (through the California Procurement Adjustment, or CPA), leave enough revenue for SoCal to remain solvent?  This was based on reports in the press recently that the DWR had requested a 25% rate increase.  
	A:	These reports were ""speculation"" and were based on numbers that DWR had submitted several weeks ago.  SoCal stated that DWR must update these numbers; therefore, no formal CPUC decision on reimbursing SoCal vis-?-vis DWR can be made at this time.  SoCal indicated that these numbers would be updated ""in a few weeks.""

	Prudential Questions to SoCal
	Q: 	What bills are currently in process dealing with the MOU?
	A:	There is the Polanco bill, which is the original MOU; the 	Assembly (Hertzberg) bill AB 82XX, which uses the Polanco bill as its foundation; and a Senate bill crafted around Byron Sher's proposals.  SoCal stated that the Sher bill was ""less a matter of using Polanco"" and approaches the MOU ""from a different direction.""  SoCal indicated that ""people are currently studying the Hertzberg will to see what the components are.""

	Q:	What is your (SoCal's) reaction to the negative article in the LA Times today regarding the legislature's perception of the MOU?  
	A:	SoCal responded that ""the LA Times sees the glass as half-empty.  By my comments, I see the glass as half-full.  We are optimistic because there something tangible that people are working on.  The fact that Hertzberg's bill uses the governor's MOU as a foundation provides us with a level of optimism.""  However, he emphasized that the company was not in a position to say whether any of the bills would make the utility creditworthy.  

	Q:	Can the governor keep the legislature from recessing in order to force them to pass an MOU?
	A:	SoCal responded, ""yes, I understand that he does have that power.  We are running out of days.  The situation is becoming more critical.  We are on borrowed time from our creditors now.  Anything that moves us toward creditworthiness, we support.""  (NOTE:  In actuality, the Governor can order legislators to the floor for a vote, but they do not have to comply.  As Burton said in the press today, ""Only the legislature can force the legislature to stay."")

Deutsche Bank Questions to SoCal
	Q:	Is the transmission asset sale off the table or not?  
	A:	The sale is in the Assembly bill, but we ""think it's more of an option in the Senate bill, like it was in the San Diego deal.""

	Q:	What are your (SoCal's) thoughts on how the California Procurement Adjustment (CPA) mechanism could be constructed to keep SoCal solvent and if a change in the mechanism for reimbursing the DWR would be needed?
	A:  	""We are highly focused on this.""  The spokesperson stated that if 	revenue is distributed in a manner ""that puts the utility in a deteriorating balance sheet situation, this will be seen as a very serious situation.  This would be unacceptable.  Our cash position is currently stable.  These changes, this would be a very serious event.""

	Q:	Has SoCal reached an agreement on paying the non-renewables or gas-fired QFs 10% of what they are owed? 
	A:	SoCal indicated that it is still in negotiations with 4 of the larger gas-fired QFs (IEP Projects).  SoCal indicated that it would make its 10% payments once the PUC order to pay is final (a 30-day appeal period is still in effect, according to SoCal).

Richard:  One of my litigation partners mentioned to me the other day that he had seen that Enron recently had been sued by Bid/Ask LLC in the Eastern District of Texas. I assume that this type of case would fall under your ""jurisdiction.""  (Just what you need, another lawsuit!).

Apparently, this caught my partner's attention because he recently had been considered as litigation counsel by another company that had been sued by Bid/Ask for infringement of Bid/Ask's patent and, in that respect, had done a considerable amount of diligence on Bid/Ask's patent and its patent application history. (This lawyer is a patent litigator).  He surmised that the lawsuit against Enron might be somewhat along the same lines; however, I don't know whether or not this is the case or not.

Since the action was brought in Texas, I assume that you are (or will be) using one of your Texas outside counsels to assist you.  Nonetheless, I thought I would just mention this prior diligence to you on the off hand chance that it could be of some assistance to you or your outside counsel, at least in terms of getting a download of any information that we may be able to impart in the event the case is very similar to this previous one.

I hope that you are doing well (or as well as can be expected with everything you have going on).  Congratulations on the resolution of the CA Senate investigation proceeding.  Let me know if you want to follow up at all on this.  If I don't talk to you before then, hopefully we can catch up for a few minutes at the ENA Legal Conference in two weeks.

Subject:	RE: Foster Wheeler suggested language for delay damages

ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION; PRIVELEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Galen,

I don't have the full history of dealing on this purchase order with FWL,
but my instincts say we don't have to accept ""material"" changes to the terms
on the eve of signing a PO.  FWL's attempt to adjust significant delay risk
at the eleventh hour constitutes a breach of good faith and fair dealing.
It is as if we were to sign the PO based on weeks of review of a firm and
final price but mark down the price a few million on the final draft because
we felt we were taken to the cleaners on a previous job they sold to us.
FWL needs to be instructed to accept the PO without the proposed changes.
If they refuse, we have (and we must tell them) the choice to contract with
another party and hold them liable for the extra cost of another supplier to
make the schedule required.  This liability is based on breach of an implied
contract and FWL faces damages for detrimental reliance (that would be the
incremental cost above FWL's firm price charged by the replacement vendor).
The reliance argument is that we excused other bidders weeks ago and chose
to exclusively deal with FWL based on agreement (reliance) of terms and
conditions presented in earlier drafts of the PO or referred to in previous
PO documents.  The detriment argument is FWL knew they had us captive to
them on this deal.  By going forward without other bidders, we lost price
protection and commitment for schedule by other bidders, therefore we are at
a detriment without market forces.  In the best world, our purchasing
activities need to keep proposals competitive by not dropping back to one
supplier for critical path equipment.

I mentioned a choice here, the other choice is to continue to deal with FWL
and accept their additional terms because the risk of changing horses and
being successful on a lawsuit based on implied contract and detrimental
reliance outweighs the risk and cost of having to ""mitigate"" the effect of
LDs on FWL if critical path work is not impacted or hard to document and
prove it was impacted, and whether our obligations were fulfilled in this
respect.  Since FWL has now opened the door to change ""material"" terms on
the eve of signing, we have the opportunity to do the same with them, but
that doesn't help if the parties continue to go in opposite directions while
your end date stays the same.  I would say they know this is a dilemma to us
and are betting we will deal with them on these new first-time ""material""
changes to the PO terms.  If we go with the second choice, I would encourage
NEPCO and Enron to take FWL off any preferred bidders list. 

In addition, I thought I heard from the folks who attended the Linden 6
settlement meeting a week ago that the parties said they would not let the
litigation on Linden 6 effect our other on-going deals.  Apparently FWL is
taking their issues on Linden 6 over to other deals.  We may want to do the
same.

Stepping back a bit, unless our documents and witnesses are crystal clear on
the implied contract theory and we have a clear fact pattern for detrimental
reliance, I wouldn't lick our chops and be confident that we got them on
this liability.  I am willing to advance an argument for posture purposes in
order to force some conclusion on the PO terms that they have attempted to
open up.  And with what little I know thus far, I would encourage we try to
strike a deal in lieu of another lawsuit.

		I am forwarding an email from Mr. Garry Greatrix, Project
Manager, Foster Wheeler Ltd.  Please read the document attached entitled
8&13.doc.  This has been presented as revised language to ""all NEPCO
contracts"" from Foster Wheeler.  This suggested language has been presented
as endorsed by Foster Wheeler legal and executive management.  The FW team
explained that this language resulted from what they have experienced with
NEPCO on recent projects, specifically Linden 6 and Kendall and that they
cannot sign the purchase contract without it.

		Since this affects more than the Lake Worth Project I felt
any acceptance or dialog regarding FW's suggested language would need to be
reviewed and approved by NEPCO legal and executive team.

Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?

I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be
part of the group as well.  But it occurs to me that maybe no one talked to
you about it.

Are you interested?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ................................................

I worked with a guy named Richard Mescon of Morgan Lewis several years ago
against HL&P and Enron.  He was top notch.  Call me for more details if

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

	Per your request for an update:

	1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

	2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

	3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

	I will keep you advised.

	I am doing this so I won't forget.  This will confirm that I will pick you up for work Wednesday morning.  I will be by your house between 7:00-7:15 (it depends on when Sue Ellen gets back from her jogging, which I don't do anymore because of my alleged heel problem).  I have an out-of-the-office meeting Wednesday evening, and I go to it directly from work at 5:30, so I won't be able to give you a ride home on Wednesday.

Of course Gail.  I'm sorry you didn't get a copy sooner. 

Millie,  Please make a copy of the arbitration demand and our response that
Seth Price submitted on our behalf.  This is entitled ""Foster Wheeler
Limited vs. NEPCO""  Please fax or overnight mail the copy to Gail Brownfeld
at Enron, EWS.  Go to the Enron web site (People Finder) to locate her
mailing address.  Thanks.

By copy to Richard Sanders, I left a voice message last week with you
describing a new matter we are developing as a claim against Overland
Construction, Inc. (a subsidiary of Black and Veatch) on a project called
""Payne Creek"", located in central Florida.  Considering the losses suffered
to date ($7 Million) the project is now spelled ""Pain Creek"".  I spoke to
Schwartzenburg about it and he suggested we enlist your group for
assistance.  I have also retained Seth Price's firm (with Derrick's
approval) to help evaluate and develop the claim.  I would like to schedule
a conference call with Seth, myself and a member of your group to review the
claim.  Schwartzenburg and myself are available on Thursday, September 13th
and so is Seth but only in the morning.  Given the time zone differences
between Seth and myself, I would like to target 11:00 AM central time.  Let
me know if Gail or someone else will be the assigned attorney.  The claim
involves construction cost overruns due to errors in the owners
specification. 

Thanks.

                Yes, against NEPCO.  We have retained Seth Price of Shapiro
Fussell in
                Atlanta.  I have Derrick's approval.  The action was
delivered two weeks
                ago

meeting, it was
                ignited again.  Seth will issue our response on Tuesday
(9/4).  Seth has
                worked on NEPCO matters before and is familiar with our
business
                practices
                and contract terms with suppliers.

Currently they
                have
                initiated
                                an
                                arbitration action before the AAA here in
Seattle for a
                payment claim
                                ($1.2
                                M) on the Linden, NJ project of which we
have held back
                payment to
                                satisfy
                                our claim for delay LDs and re-work ($3.8
M).  While
                this
                action is
                                pending,
                                FWL has initiated some unlawful bargaining
tactics on
                our
                Lakeworth, FL
                                project.  More of the drama is outlined
below. 

                                No need for action here.

                                ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION; PRIVELEGED
AND
                CONFIDENTIAL

                                Galen,

                                I don't have the full history of dealing on
this
                purchase
                order with
                                FWL,
                                but my instincts say we don't have to accept
""material""
                changes to the
                                terms
                                on the eve of signing a PO.  FWL's attempt
to adjust
                significant delay
                                risk
                                at the eleventh hour constitutes a breach of
good faith
                and
                fair
                                dealing.
                                It is as if we were to sign the PO based on
weeks of
                review
                of a firm
                                and
                                final price but mark down the price a few
million on the
                final draft
                                because
                                we felt we were taken to the cleaners on a
previous job
                they
                sold to us.
                                FWL needs to be instructed to accept the PO
without the
                proposed
                                changes.
                                If they refuse, we have (and we must tell
them) the
                choice
                to contract
                                with
                                another party and hold them liable for the
extra cost of
                another
                                supplier to
                                make the schedule required.  This liability
is based on
                breach of an
                                implied
                                contract and FWL faces damages for
detrimental reliance
                (that would be
                                the
                                incremental cost above FWL's firm price
charged by the
                replacement
                                vendor).
                                The reliance argument is that we excused
other bidders
                weeks
                ago and
                                chose
                                to exclusively deal with FWL based on
agreement
                (reliance)
                of terms and
                                conditions presented in earlier drafts of
the PO or
                referred
                to in
                                previous
                                PO documents.  The detriment argument is FWL
knew they
                had
                us captive to
                                them on this deal.  By going forward without
other
                bidders,
                we lost
                                price
                                protection and commitment for schedule by
other bidders,
                therefore we
                                are at
                                a detriment without market forces.  In the
best world,
                our
                purchasing
                                activities need to keep proposals
competitive by not
                dropping back to
                                one
                                supplier for critical path equipment.

                                I mentioned a choice here, the other choice
is to
                continue
                to deal with
                                FWL
                                and accept their additional terms because
the risk of
                changing horses
                                and
                                being successful on a lawsuit based on
implied contract
                and
                detrimental
                                reliance outweighs the risk and cost of
having to
                ""mitigate""
                the effect
                                of
                                LDs on FWL if critical path work is not
impacted or hard
                to
                document and
                                prove it was impacted, and whether our
obligations were
                fulfilled in
                                this
                                respect.  Since FWL has now opened the door
to change
                ""material"" terms
                                on
                                the eve of signing, we have the opportunity
to do the
                same
                with them,
                                but
                                that doesn't help if the parties continue to
go in
                opposite
                directions
                                while
                                your end date stays the same.  I would say
they know
                this is
                a dilemma
                                to us
                                and are betting we will deal with them on
these new
                first-time
                                ""material""
                                changes to the PO terms.  If we go with the
second
                choice, I
                would
                                encourage
                                NEPCO and Enron to take FWL off any
preferred bidders
                list.

                                In addition, I thought I heard from the
folks who
                attended
                the Linden 6
                                settlement meeting a week ago that the
parties said they
                would not let
                                the
                                litigation on Linden 6 effect our other
on-going deals.
                Apparently FWL
                                is
                                taking their issues on Linden 6 over to
other deals.  We
                may
                want to do
                                the
                                same.

                                Stepping back a bit, unless our documents
and witnesses
                are
                crystal
                                clear on
                                the implied contract theory and we have a
clear fact
                pattern
                for
                                detrimental
                                reliance, I wouldn't lick our chops and be
confident
                that we
                got them on
                                this liability.  I am willing to advance an
argument for
                posture
                                purposes in
                                order to force some conclusion on the PO
terms that they
                have attempted
                                to
                                open up.  And with what little I know thus
far, I would
                encourage we try
                                to
                                strike a deal in lieu of another lawsuit.

Steve:  Did Hennigan give you any timetable for getting back to you on settlement?  We will need to follow up quickly.

Richard:  Hope you escaped from the storm relatively unscathed.  It sounds like Tuesday was a drizzle compared to what Houston experienced yesterday.

>>> <showard@agsk.com> 06/09/01 02:51PM >>>
See below.  Farallon has moved for summary judgment against Natwest, McDonald,
and PaineWebber.  If the motion is credible, it should ratchet up the pressure
on those three defendants to settle.  Assuming that we don't want to be the
only defendant at trial (or one of two, SDI being the other), we need to
follow the settlement negotiations as closely as we can and try to get in
(while appearing uninterested), or make a separate deal, at the last minute.

The key to getting current information on settlement efforts by the other
defendants is Mike Diamond.  Because Mike still wants Richard's business, and
Mike and I are close, Mike is likely to be pretty forthcoming if Richard or I
ask him what is going on.

Our local legal newspaper, The Daily Journal, reported in Thursday's edition
that the AG will ask a Sacramento Grand Jury to investigate whether ""the
California market was manipulated and profits taken illegally, and whether there
was fraud against the public"".  The story reports that the investigation ""will
begin shortly after July 1"" which is consistent with out recent intelligence.
My guess is you have already seen this basic story because the Journal picked it
off the AP wire service.

Do you already have some clipping service keeping track of all the stories being

Importance:	High

Richard,
  Peter Meringolo, from Brobeck, has requested copies of email files and documents be made for review at the Brobeck offices.  My recommendation is that the review be made at the Enron offices and that only those files that pertain to the case be copied (or printed) to take to Brobeck's offices.  I'd like to minimize the amount of non-pertinent information that leaves our control.  Attached is the message I sent to Dave on this issue.  If you feel it is most appropriate to give them copies of everything, I understand, I just wanted to convey the risks and obtain your acceptance.
  The office manager in San Francisco has had arrangements in place (for the last month) so that Brobeck could review the documents in the San Francisco office.  I understand from Peter that they are getting much closer to needing to complete the review, so if you can let me know what route you decide on that would be great.  THanks.  -gabriella

Dave,
  	Peter Meringolo, from Brobek, has sent me a request to create copies of Sue Mara's, Mike McDonald's and your email files and documents so that they can be reviewed at Brobeck's offices.  I recommend that the email files and documents be reviewed at your offices, and if necessary, only those messages and documents responsive to the subpoena be copied electronically for use at the Brobeck offices. (The issue with making electronic copies of material is that once it is out of our control we will no longer have any idea of how many copies were made, who had access to the material, or know how it was stored and protected.  Therefore, it is in our best interest to reduce the information copied electronically to only what is essential.)  If printing is adequate then I would recommend that Brobeck print the documents that are responsive to the subpoena. 
 	April has set up appropriate access to the system and files so that they can be reviewed in your office spaces.  I have spoken with Peter and promised that I would get your input (as well as Richard Sanders) on the issue.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  Best regards.  -gabriella

Subject: Review of Electronic Documents


Gabriella,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the copying of email and electronic
documents in the possession of certain employees in Enron's San Francisco
office.  As we discussed, this email sets forth our request and our reasons
this request.  I truly appreciate you discussing this issue with Richard
Sanders and Dave Parquet.  

REQUEST:  We request that Enron copy onto CD's certain electronic documents
and emails in the possession of Dave Parquet, Sue Mara and Mike McDonald.
Thereafter, we will review these documents and produce only those documents
and emails that are responsive to subpoenas from the California Senate and
the California Attorney General.  The documents and emails we request to be
copied likely contain documents and emails not responsive to these two
outstanding subpoenas.  

REASONS FOR REQUEST:  You raise valid concerns with our proposal insofar as
we ask for copies of documents and emails that are not responsive to the
subpoenas.  We believe our proposal is the best approach for following
reasons:

	(1) We can accurately keep control of what we have reviewed, what we
have deemed responsive, and what we have deemed privileged.  (Folders can be set up for filing and tracking these documents. -gc)


	(2) We can re-review materials in the likely event of further
subpoenas or documents requests.  (All documents and emails are to be retained so that they will be available for future reviews. -gc)

	(3) We can review the materials in the least disruptive manner
possible -- on our own computers and in our offices. (Operating from your office may be an inconvenience, but it minimizes the risk of losing control of sensitive documents that have no bearing on the case. -gc)

	(4) We can review at the pace dictated by the litigation, which is
unpredictable (to say the least).  (As long as access to your office spaces and the system is made available this should not be an issue. -gc)

Concerns about security and confidentiality are common in all litigation and
document review.  We always take these concerns seriously.  We will restrict
access to these documents to only those persons involved with reviewing and
organizing the documents.  We will work with you to ensure that these
documents will remain in strict confidence.

Again, I truly appreciate your taking the time to discuss these matters with
me as well as with Dave and Richard.  If there is any further information
you need, please do not hesitate to ask.  

Very truly yours, 

Peter Meringolo

I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last week's trade press.

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO ""backpedal"" statements made re: claims of strategic bidding would apply equally to other importers.

The reason I asked was because our IT people in Houston have told us that we cannot transfer emails that we need beyond the retention period to word documents.  That seemed a bit strange, but they were quite emphatic.   I have clarified the rule with our IT head.

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

Texas fights Davis' claim of banditry
By James Rosen
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published Sept. 2, 2001)
HOUSTON  --  All summer long, the corporate barons of Energy Alley have listened to Californians castigate them as greedy gougers with friends in high places, and they've about heard an earful.
Instead of sailing the seas in brigantines, the Texas power merchants targeted as ""profiteers and pirates"" by Gov. Gray Davis ply their trade from atop glass masts along Louisiana Street in downtown Houston.
""We are proud of what we've done in California to help keep the lights on,"" Joe Bob Perkins, president of wholesale business for Reliant Energy, said in his 47th-floor office. ""We've run our plants at record levels. We invested four times more in 2000 than we did in 1998. Reliant certainly didn't withhold power. We did everything we could to make it available. We made more money because we sold more electricity.""

Subject:	El Paso FERC Case

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT AND OTHER PRIVILEGES

Mark:

I assume that you and Richard are very familiar with the day-to-day developments in the heavily publicized FERC case involving the investigation by FERC of El Paso's sale of pipeline capacity into the CA market to its merchant arm last year that CA officials have partly blamed for the spike in gas and power prices.  As you know, this is the case where the highest executives of El Paso recently were called to testify at FERC.

An article in this morning's New York Times (which begins on page 1), in discussing El Paso's significant earnings generated by the El Paso merchant arm from the pipeline capacity purchase, says that the parties with which El Paso hedged its position also made sizeable profits.  The article notes that about half of El Paso's trades were with Enron ""according to people present at the briefings El Paso officials have given to California officials.""  While this probably is not surprising in light of our size and breadth in the market, it nonetheless is made to sound somewhat sinister, and my sense is that it is just another potential barb for the CA officials to throw at us.  Since the article quotes a response from Mark Palmer (in which he suggests that Enron, in turn, likely would have resold the capacity and would not have realized the benefit of the rising market), I assumed that you were aware of it, but I thought I would err on the side of putting an extra e-mail in your in-box.

Further to our discussion regarding participation on behalf of Idaho Power in the FERC dockets (EL00-95-031, et al), after their call to me this weekend.  Their interest focuses on sales into and purchases from the ISO and the PX, substantial portions of which remain unpaid.  The sales at issue are not from their own generation but are as a marketer.  Idaho expects to assert that marketer sales must take into account more than the simple price of procurement, but also associated costs and a margin.  Conditions that enhance the creditworthiness of purchasers also are likely to be on Idaho's agenda.  The foregoing is provided solely to assure that Enron will not interpose any objection to our role on behalf of Idaho.  I attended the morning session of the settlement conference before Judge Wagner as an observer, pending completion of our formal procedures.  Bear in mind that Dan Watkiss of Bracewell & Patterson appeared on behalf of the involved Enron subsidiaries.  Understandably Idaho would like our position confirmed at the earliest possible time, as they already had to release their traditional FERC counsel.

Richard, Andy, 

Ted has been served with a Notice to Produce Documents in litigation between Fred Greenberg (plaintiff) and the Corp board of directors (attached below). The docs Ted is required to produce relate to benefits he may have received from a number of Enron related finance entities in his capacity as Representative of those entities. 

I presume this request can be dealt with entirely in Houston and substantially without Ted's involvement (?). I'd be grateful if you could confirm what the process will be for dealing with this and what input, if any, you will require from Ted.

Thanks for the direction.  EES also has a claim, separate and apart from
the claim described in my orignial email. EES's claim was in the $5 million
range and they've already gotten a distribution in the $700,000. Thanks and

   Hello!

   It was nice to see you at the POS event last week.  I can't believe that
   we're into a new school year. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch; we did
   a
   fair amount of traveling this summer and now I'm over my head preparing
   for
   a trial that begins mid-October.

   I assume/hope that you did receive a payment from the PCA trustee on
   account of EPMI's allowed claim.  If you didn't, shame on me for not
   following up.  If you need me to, please just let me know.

   The only other open matter I have for ENA is in the Perry Gas case in
   which
   ENA filed a proof of claim in the amount of about $1,918,000.  A plan of
   liquidation has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the
   anticipated
   (not guaranteed) payout over time is expected to be in the 55-60% range.
   The post-confirmation trustee is in the process of reconciling claims.

   From the email below sent to my from the post-liquidation trustee's
   counsel
   (who was also counsel to Perry Gas during the bankruptcy case), it
   appears
   that the trustee's accounting people have been talking to Willie Stewart
   in
   accounting at ENA to try to reconcile the slightly different numbers.

   From what I understand, Willie Stewart and Perry agree that, with the
   exception of $78,337.16 that ENA owed Perry  for August 1999 deliveries,
   the amount of the prepetition claim is $1,903,490.72.   Provided that
   there
   is no disagreement about the amount of unpaid sales from Perry to ENA
   for
   August 1999, the $78,337.16 should be offset against the $1,903,490.72
   claim, which would leave ENA with a prepetition claim of $1,825,153.56.

   I would be happy to deal directly with Willie on this if you'd like --
   just
   let me know.  If Willie agrees with the $78,337.16 amount due to Perry
   for
   August 1999, do I have authority to agree to the prepetition claim of
   $1,825,153.56?  Perry has made one distribution and I'll get the
   commitment
   up front that as soon as the agreed order allowing ENA's claim, Perry
   will
   cut a check for the first distribution.

   If my case settles, I'll give you a call to set up a lunch.  I'd like to
   get caught up.  Thanks and take care.

EGM is requesting a list of the attorneys that work on EGM cases.  Based on our allocation schedule (I have attached it again for your reference), the following cost center owners are allocating costs to EGM: Sanders, Taylor, Aronowitz, Cash.

Could you please give me a list of attorneys within these groups that work on EGM?  I realize that Aronowitz's group is 100% EGM, so a list of attorney's in that group would work.  I also realize that Michelle Cash is probably the one within her own group who would do any work for them.  In addition though, for Sanders and Taylor, can you find out from them who in their group would work on EGM?  Is it them or attorneys within their groups?

I need to have this information today if possible.

Thanks,
Edie

	Per your request for an update:

	1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

	2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

	3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

	I will keep you advised.

To:	Sanders, Richard B.; Edison, Andrew
Cc:	Zikes, Becky
Subject:	RSM Production v. El Paso


	A couple of suggestions on which I would appreciate your response:

	1.  I believe we need to have internal due diligence/factual investigation done on whether any of the Enron entities served--Enron Corp.(of which Northern was a division for a period of time), Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. (EGM) or Intratex ever gathered gas, was the first measurer of gas, or provided measurement of gas on which ad valorem taxes were calculated, for Zapata County or communitized wells in adjacent counties that included leases located in whole or in part in Zapata County.  The petition specifically mentions that it includes acts going back to 1974 and earlier, so I would like to see how far back we can fairly easily put together a chronology.  What I hope to have is a time line of who did what and during what period of time, and locate the most important documents to show this.  

	I am assuming that EGM was at all times only a marketer, although we need to do the due diligence to make sure.  Enron Corp. will be pretty easy, although Northern was for a brief period of time in the early 90s a division of Enron Corp., and Northern had non-contiguous gathering in South Texas that stopped right at the Zapata County line.  If that gathering system took gas from, say, a well in an adjacent county that was communitized with a lease in Zapata County, Enron Corp. may stay in the picture.  Last, with respect to Intratex, I am told by Lou that we no longer have the Intratex documents; did they go with HPL as a result of the sale? 

	Becky and I are stretched thin on various matters right now and would like to suggest that we retain Marianne Salinas on this project immediately.  

	2. I think it would be helpful to snag a first-rate gas measurement consultant now, before they all get taken.  I know Ken Cessac, who works here, very well, and think a great deal of him.  I know Andy has used him extensively already in Grynberg-related matters.  You may want to save money and not retain our own consultant, and instead rely on Ken; however, I know that Ken is being kept very busy.  On the other hand, I also think it is likely that we will wind up sharing at least the testifying gas measurement experts and their costs.  So, this is a judgment call.  However, I would be inclined to go ahead and retain Paul LaNasa, who sits on several AGA committees, as an Enron-only consulting expert, even though I don't think he is up to speed on the Grynberg allegations.  Both Grant Harvy and I were very impressed by him during the Northern v. ONEOK arbitration, during which we worked with him extensively and presented him as an expert witness (although I don't proposed to use him as a testifying expert here).  My point would be that if there was anything wrong with Enron's measurement that was either worse than or better than our co-defendants' measurement,  or put us in a different position, I am very confident he could point it out to us.  

	I appreciate your thoughts.

	Britt

PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on accounting procedures.  Where is this going?  This would be very bad.

I think I mentioned this before to you. Dave Noonan and I jointly own a 3 bedroom condo in Park City, Utah. If you and your wife, with or without kids, want to get away for a break(and remain beyond the California borders), you are welcome to use it. It sits vacant most of the time.

Stacy,

We deducted the difference between Index and his fixed price hedge from hs last check.  He removed his meters 2 months prior to the expiration of his fixed price hedge.  He says he did not have a valid contract with ENA.  He was sent a Confirmation at the time of the deal.  He did not contact me about not having a contract until the prices were above his fixed price deal pricing.  Dan Hyvl agreed that the deduction should be made from the final payment to Adkins.  Dan should have all the info.

 I am on my way back from vacation today.  Call me on my cell phone @ 330-284-3871.

Here are:  1. a copy of the Confirmation and 2. the worksheet used to make the deductions.

 << File: Adkins Confirmation.doc >>      << File: F Adkins Final Payment.xls >> 

P.S.  He pulled the same stunt with Jim Javins  - EES, prior to moving his meters to CES.

My instructions from Kevin Heffron who is the commercial lead overseeing this matter is to file the answer and counterclaim within the normal time limit, without seeking any time extension.  The intention is to signal beyond doubt that we mean business - and Kevin is concerned that seeking an extension, however usual, will give the opposite message.  Our target should therefore be to file this week and I suggest that we stick to the original schedule.
 
Thanks for your help

Subject: RE: Longview


I have left a message for Richard to this effect, but wanted to make sure that everyone was in the loop.  Due to the incidents in the US yesterday our offices in Chicago were evacuated.  That has thrown off our schedule slightly for distributing the answer and counterclaim.  We plan on having a draft to everyone by 12:00 noon tomorrow.  I am also going to contact opposingc ounsel to let see if they would be agreeable to an extension of time to answer.  (I will wait until we discuss the matter to specify a definite time period for an extension).  In all likelihood, we can obtain an extension from opposing counsel (and/or the Court) if that is necessary in light of the events. 
 
In light of this revised schedule, we may want to reschedule the conference call currently set for 7 am central time tomorrow.  That is up to you.
 
Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any questions or concerns about the revised schedule and for what time you would like to have the conference call.

REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE
 
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at ""[no] more than 50%..."" (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.

We have fought hard on this, but the city attorney is steadfast:  He wants to be able to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether to arbitrate or litigate a particular dispute.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP IF YOU OBJECT TO THE DELETION OF THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS (the agreement will just be silent as to whether the parties can use litigation or arbitration).  Otherwise, we will shortly be executing the master trading agreement, which is needed for a particular trade we are negotiating with the city, as well as for general trading purposes, which Christian and Steve have been handling.

It's worth pointing out that the city attorney made very few proposed changes to this complex agreement.  I thought that was a little strange.  Also, we won the battle to keep TX law for the Enron corp. guaranty.

Thank you,

Kenton

I'm wanting to send out the attached demand letter later today or tomorrow, after credit and the deal makers have had a chance to corroborate the facts.  Would you please review and get back to me with any concerns over issuing this demand.  The transaction involves as sale of old corrugated cardboard to a Chinese paper mill who has a sales office in California.  The Confirm was issued under the old Pulp & Paper General Terms and Conditions that do not contain an Arbitration Clause.

Thanks

Aparna,

Please review the attached for factual accuracy and forward to anyone you believe should comment.  Also, please note that we should include copies of the invoices that total the US$292,522.77 with the Demand Letter.  Will you please obtain them from accounting.  Please call with any questions.

Subject: Press Conference


Senator Ray Haynes (R) held a press conference this morning to discuss a
report his office produced regarding municipal utility energy charges.
Twelve reporters attended the press conference.  According to Senator
Haynes, none of municipal utilities provided him with documentation or
assistance with his report.  Senator Haynes delivered the report to Senator
Dunn and has requested that he open an investigation into municipal utility
practices.  He also expressed continued disappointment over the Senate's
unwillingness to adopt his legislative amendment which would establish a
windfall profit's tax for municipal utilities.

Senator Haynes referenced Enron several times by comparing Enron's rates to
those rates charged by LADWP and SMUD.

In developing the report, Senator Haynes' office did not analyze peak versus
off peak energy prices, what percentage of power was being sold by municipal
utilities, or, what the cost for producing or procuring power was for the
municipal utilities.  These items were raised by a reporter.  After the
press conference, reporters met privately with SMUD and other municipal
utilities who defended their actions and refuted Senator Haynes' claims.

I was able to obtain one copy of the report and will FedEx it to Karen in
Houston.

I have a document by someone named Marty Howard, who I believe may be
associated with Portland General. The document was sent to me by Richard
Tabors. According to the email Howard used to work for McCullough.

After a very brief read through, I think it tries to show that the
statistical link between prices in CA and the PNW was WEAK in peak hours. I
suppose they are trying to show that the ""contagion"" effect from California
show not be an issue? I have some problems from an initial read with the
econometric analysis, but I have not yet reviewed it fully.

However, it also leaves open the very possibility that was discussed earlier
on the call. If there is a refund, and it is based on some notion of ""PNW
prices"", it could be a very large one. I think we need to consider this
issue quite carefully.

Richard Sanders of Enron called me  yesterday morning.  He said that Enron is  selling the Arlington ""plant"" even before construction begins.  In other  words, Enron is selling the land, the permit applications, some turbines and  other equipment, and the technology for building the plant.  Richard said  that he would try to confirm this information by speaking to the in-house Enron  attorney who is handling this project.  This is probably confidential  information, so I suggest that you not disclose it outside the firm.  I  will attempt to obtain the name of the buyer so as to determine whether we may  be in a position to provide services to that entity.   Thanks.

Richard & Lisa:  I understand from Carl that there is a call with some of the generators tomorrow to discuss the foregoing.  In that respect, I am forwarding a brief memo that we prepared a number of months ago (prior to PG&E's filing) regarding some of the issues/considerations that potentially would arise if Enron Wind were to file an involuntary petition against SCE.  The memo is a bit ""dated"" but I nonetheless thought it might be helpful to you to some extent in terms of setting forth some of the relevant considerations that arise in the involuntary context.  Please let me know if you would like any follow up on any of this prior to the call.  Thanks  John

	Drew, I got your voice-mail, which included Richard's voice-mail to you.  I have an open file on this breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit between the above-referenced characters, and have been dealing with informal discovery responses from both.  If it is the same lawsuit, I am surprised that I have not been given a call about any deposition of Stan Horton.  I am asking Becky to follow up with Richard about who he got the telephone call from, and compare that with the attorneys of record we know about.

	I will be on the road most of the day driving to Fort Worth for a family reunion.  I will have my cell phone (713-252-7711).  Hopefully, we won't need to do anything until Monday, but if that is not the case, I will make sure this gets handled.

Subject:	John W. Schultes v. McDonald Investments, etal

Bonnie, Jim Studdert has assigned me the lawsuit of John W. Schultes v. McDonald Investments, etal., wherein ENA and ECT Thailand are named defendants.

I have reviewed the lawsuit and have determined there is an obligation to defend this entire matter given the allegations associated with ""Personal injury"", which means injury, other than ""bodily injury"", arising out of oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services, and/or oral or written publication of material that violates a person's right of privacy.

A review of the Complaint indicates there are allegations associated with Defamation Per Se, Defamation Per Quod, and Invasion of Privacy.  All of the other allegations are predicated on ""intentional"" conduct/activity, which would not constitute an ""occurrence"" which has resulted in ""bodily injury"" or ""property damage"".  Thus, while we will defend the entire lawsuit, we will only contribute to a settlement or respond to an award for damages associated with the aforementioned counts, assuming such were not made with knowledge of their falsity.

I note suit was filed on February 22, 2001.  As such, please immediately provide me with the following for our file:

*	The identity of defense counsel and a copy of the Engagement Agreement which was provided to them (please include copies of all required monthly billing statements which they have submitted thus far so we can consider reimbursement to the operating company from the date we were first given notice of this matter).
*	Provide a copy of the Answer and any other pleadings filed to-date.
*	Have defense counsel provide their analysis of our alleged exposure, if not done already.
*     Advise who is the assigned ELU Legal Assistant assigned to this matter so we can advise them to copy us on all correspondence going forward.

Following receipt of the above, it may be a good idea to meet and discuss this matter.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

not much to report.  the other defendants apparently have yet to come to ground on a final settlement agreement.  i spoke with one of the principal drafters today, who sounded frustrasted and would report only that they ""are still working on it.""  she also withdrew her colleague's prior indication that there was one thing we would be able to know once they settled.  she was quite firm that the confidentiality provisions were all encompassing, with no carve-outs.

neither we nor they have heard a word from the court. when the last hearing was cancelled, it was left that the court would give the parties some time to work out a settlement and then would schedule a status conference to figure out who was in/out, and how to proceed.

if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me.

Richard,

I spoke to Paul Heath and he said the bankruptcy code tolls the running of
limitations, so long as time to file had not run prior to the filing of the
bankruptcy petition.  The code provides for a new, two-year limitations
period from the time the petition in bankruptcy is filed.  From our
conversation, it sounds like that was filed on 9/4/99, and we will then
expect to see Ben's suit filed by 9/4/01.

The attached is my summary of what I perceived as the key bullet points from
Grella's testimony with some page references.  I hope it's useful.

Subject:	Billings

My accounting department advises me that back on April 27,2001,  Enron apparently sent us a check for $54,585.11, which we received and deposited on May 7. The check  included the payment of $28,087.71 for this firm (the exact amount of our February billing) and mistakenly included payment of $26,497.40 for one of Ed Kee's (PA Consulting Group) bills. That check was received after we sent our March billing and is thus not reflected on that bill. The full amount of that check showed up as a May 7 payment to us from Enron on our April billing, and reduced the outstanding balance by that amount. Whereas the total balance due shown on the April statement sent to Enron was $44,772.92, if the overpayment had not been made , the true balance due would have been $26,497.40 higher. Given the delay in sending our bills, and the accumulation of additional time, there was never a credit balance on a billing to Enron, but the total balances due always included credit for the prior overpayment. We are about to send out our July billing today and our accounting department(Annmarie Robertson) got a call from Martha at Enron(345-4088) who realized what happened and asked for a refund check. We can and will obviously do that , but then we have to immediately ask Enron for that same amount-$26,497.40- because our prior bills would have been underpaid by that same amount. I am told that we cannot easily(if at all) go back and have the computer generate previous months' bills now with an unpaid balance when they were previously paid. My accounting department says it would be easier to just send out  the July billing with a cover letter confirming that the $26,497.40 erroneously paid to us on May 7 has been credited in full  to Enron, and is fully reflected in the total balance due. Hopefully this makes sense and I know we both have bigger matters to deal with.  Can you approve us doing this or send us an email if Enron needs to get a check and revised billings. Thanks. .

Subject:	PX Call

We had the shortest call in history today.  We discussed Edison.  Edison
withdrew its opposition to our employment of professionals and will be
producing documents in response to our 2004 notice.  There's been some
speculation about whether parties will be filing an involuntary petition
against SCE.  Reliant wasn't on our call today and I couldn't help but
wonder whether they were busy with other things.  In that regard, Howard
Weg is establishing an SCE subcommittee and wants us to participate.
What's your position.  As to Edison, there's a reasonable likelihood now
that the legislature will approve a package that (1) has no funding to pay
us, (2) permits Edison to use funds to pay dividends on preferred stock and
(3) waives Edison's commandeering claims.  As to the last issue, Kaye
Scholer opines that Edison's waiver will have no impact on the PX's right
to pursue the commandeering suit.  This week there will be several meetings
aimed at finalizing a reorganization plan.  We'll have a report during our
next call which is scheduled Sept,. 17 at 1 LA time.  Weg is consulting
with FERC lawyers about presentation of his proposed settlement.  He plans
to proceed fairly soon both before FERC and in the bankruptcy court.  Bob

There is a committee call Sept. 10 at 12 your time.  It's the regular
weekly committee call.  We may discuss further the arbitration issue
although, for the moment, it would appear that the vote is against making a
demand, at least until after FERC rules.  I won't be surprised however, if
Weg keeps lobbying to try and get the committee to come around on this
issue.  We need to discuss how we will fund the operations. professionals
etc both pending plan confirmation (hopefully early 2002) and after
confirmation.  Weg suggests that we use the earnings on the $400 million
held by PX.  Any thoughts in that regard?  Bob

For purposes of clarification, our answer and counterclaim are due on Monday, September 17.  That should not present any problem as far as we are concerned.  My point in raising the extension issue is merely to let everyone know that, since our schedule at MBP is sliding slightly, an extension is an available option if needed.  However, I see no problem in getting the answer filed by Monday.  (It should also be noted that court here was closed yesterday and today.  This may effect when filings will be due as well.  We are looking into the matter).
Please let me know if you have any questions.

My instructions from Kevin Heffron who is the commercial lead overseeing 
this matter is to file the answer and counterclaim within the normal 
time limit, without seeking any time extension.  The intention is to 
signal beyond doubt that we mean business - and Kevin is concerned that 
seeking an extension, however usual, will give the opposite message. 
Our target should therefore be to file this week and I suggest that we 
stick to the original schedule. 
  
Thanks for your help

Subject: RE: Longview 
I have left a message for Richard to this effect, but wanted to make 
sure that everyone was in the loop.  Due to the incidents in the US 
yesterday our offices in Chicago were evacuated.  That has thrown off 
our schedule slightly for distributing the answer and counterclaim.  We 
plan on having a draft to everyone by 12:00 noon tomorrow.  I am also 
going to contact opposingc ounsel to let see if they would be agreeable 
to an extension of time to answer.  (I will wait until we discuss the 
matter to specify a definite time period for an extension).  In all 
likelihood, we can obtain an extension from opposing counsel (and/or the 
Court) if that is necessary in light of the events. 
  
In light of this revised schedule, we may want to reschedule the 
conference call currently set for 7 am central time tomorrow.  That is 
up to you. 
  
Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any questions or 
concerns about the revised schedule and for what time you would like to 
have the conference call.

REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE 
  
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success 
assessed at ""[no] more than 50%..."" (ie. definitely less than 50%) is 
depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our 
bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation 
which McCook have forced on us. 
  
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for 
comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day 
period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my 
calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent 
to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation 
dept). Thank you.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

The Rio Piedras Explosion Litigation note needs to be updated. My suggested note follows with deletions being noted by ""***"" and additions noted in bold.  Please let me know if you have any questions are comments.

____________ 

On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in *** the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties *** agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants *** agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trail in the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001. No cases have yet been scheduled for trail in the Superior Court. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

3. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 
Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations. 
Litigation. In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron. The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated. Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately. In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s. This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants. In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988. The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims. On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court. The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations. The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
Trojan Investment Recovery. In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan. 
The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB). 
In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant. Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation. The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000. As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment. Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order. With the CUB's withdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation. The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan. 
Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
Environmental Matters. Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites. The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses. These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations. Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities. Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

it's tough because for a huge city with lots of lawyers there really aren't many business trial lawyers there.  its not like texas or california.

we know david boies well and have done a number of things with him.  he might be interested because there is so much at stake and it is so high profile.  of course, tho, he is stretched way way too thin and doesn't really have that much depth in his firm.  we could pitch it to him that we'll provide the back up, if you want.

another idea is david foster at willkie farr.  widely regarded in the city as one of the best trial lawyers. confidentially, we will be opening a nyc office by sept, and are negotiating with foster about his joining us.  i could put you in touch with some general counsel who think very highly of him.  again, we could provide coordination and back up if you like.  of course there would be value in maintaining consistency of positions in new york and california, less learning curve, etc.  i am a member of the new york bar as are about 8 of our partners.

>>> <Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com> 05/15/01 03:44PM >>>
I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.

Subject:	Remand Decision

Judge Whaley's decision granting the plaintiffs' remand motions is attached.
Judge Whaley held that, while the filed rate doctrine may well constitute an
""absolute defense,""  it does not support complete preemption sufficient to
provide federal jurisdiction.  While not the result we wanted, that aspect
of the decision was not unexpected.  Also, at several points, Judge Whaley
confirmed the ""central and controlling role"" the federal government plays in
the regulation of wholesale energy issues.

Unfortunately, the decision also includes Judge Whaley's view that
plaintiffs can state claims under the Cartwright Act and UCL statute
""without alleging or establishing that the electric rates charged were not
'just and reasonable'"". Decision at 14-16.   While not binding on the state
court, plaintiffs will no doubt seek to make use of these and other portions
of Judge Whaley's decision to oppose our state court pleading challenge.

I'll set up a conference call in the next day or so to discuss status and
approach in light of the remand decision.

Regards.

My partner Donn Pickett has been trying to get Richard Sanders to sign off on the attached conflicts letter concerning our representation of Reliant in the litigation in California in which Enron is also involved.  I understand the letter confirms prior conversations between Richard and Donn.  Karen suggested that, because you see Richard frequently, maybe we could enlist your help in getting the paperwork processed.  We would greatly appreciate that.

I hope all is going well for you and your family.  Let me know if you have any questions.

> conversation, I understand that you agree that this is an acceptable
> procedure.
>
> 2.	With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would
> like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to
> discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest
> Drive Image Pro 4.0.  In addition, there may be some other individuals

> started until after the new year.
>
> 3.	Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along

> related to the subject matter of your request would be instructed not to
> delete business email.
>
> 4.	We believe that relevant database  backups have been and will
> continue to be made and preserved.
>
> 5.	When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it
> is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the
> network (where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files
> to make sufficient work space for the employee to work.
>
> 6.	For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do

PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Subject:	AG v. Enron

I have revised and am emailing to you and Robin a copy of the revised Molland Declaration that I have sent back to Michael this afternoon wherein he explains what happened yesterday regarding the tentative ruling and asks for oral argument. When I spoke to Michael late this afternoon about the declaration I learned some additional information which is contrary to one of our assumptions, and suggests it will be harder to expect the court to go forward with argument on Monday. Through this afternoon(when I had discussed this separately with Richard and Robin today), we have been operating on the assumption that only telephonic notice to opposing counsel of the intent to argue was required to have oral argument in SFO court and that notice to the court itself was not required. If so, the court would have this one on its Monday calendar. I asked Michael again how the Court would know what matters would actually be on the oral argument calendar and was told today that the telephonic instructions from the court which accompany the tentative ruling tell you before listening to the recorded ruling  that apparently YOU HAVE TO PUSH A CERTAIN TELEPHONE NUMBER BUTTON AT THE END OF THE ORAL RULING IF THE MATTER IS TO REMAIN ON CALENDAR FOR ORAL ARGUMENT. That was not done by the person who first called and listened to the ruling for Michael. When someone called back and attempted to do so the response was ""invalid"" or something to that effect. Presumably that was because it was sometime after the 4:30 deadline. This would suggest that we are not even on the calendar (without a request for oral argument)as we had hoped. I still will be there to argue, or at least argue for a hearing date. I wanted Bob to know of this new info in case it affects his decision on coming out here. Call me on my cell 619-985-9792 any time if anyone has questions. I will be emailing the draft replies for Sacramento tomorrow.

`
	Richard,

	This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced referral.  You told me that we were to act as first-chair trial counsel in this matter, and instructed me to retain local counsel immediately.

	On the recommendation of Susman & Godfrey and Willy Wood of Fulbright & Jaworski, and with Jim Derrick's authority, I am happy to report that I have retained Lazaro Garza-Gongora of Laredo as local counsel for us in this matter, at his usual hourly rate of $175, and a retainer of $5,000, to be applied by him against his fees and expenses.   By acting quickly on this, we eliminated the risk of the remaining defendants snapping up all available local counsel and being forced to beg for a share of one.  I would of course be willing to consider sharing Lazaro (and his fees) with other defendants, but with the understanding that in the event of a conflict, Lazaro would only represent us, and would be allowed to stay in the case. 

	I anticipate that there will be a comprehensive joint defense agreement in this matter and that both local counsel and experts, including gas measurement experts, may be shared.  I will be speaking with you shortly about retaining a gas measurement expert.

	Lazaro is going to the courthouse to review the court's file and will report shortly on what he finds.

	Please let me know how you want Lazaro's bills handled.

	Please let me know who needs to be in the reporting loop on this one.

	As always, we greatly appreciate the chance to work with you.

	I will keep you closely advised.

	Britt

FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW
  
09/24/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday. 
""I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market,"" concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case. 
The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said. 
""Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on,"" Cintron said. 
Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region. 
""The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers,"" the judge said. 
The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case. 
     
At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001. 
In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. 
The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December. 
Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission. 
""Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market,"" Cintron concluded. ""This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner."" 
""Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard,"" Cintron said. 
California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million). 
Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds. 
Cintron was persuaded by the ""ripple"" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds. 
""Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task,"" Cintron said. 
""The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market,"" the judge said. 
""Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale,"" she said. 
The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed. 
In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market. 
While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices. 
Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.

REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE
 
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at ""[no] more than 50%..."" (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.

I have had several more conversations that convince me that FERC will provide very helpful answers to the three quesitions that Robin sent to me regarding FERC's jurisdiction over the issues in the California cases.

You should be aware of timing issues.  Two of FERC's five positions (both Republican or Independent) are vacant, but soon to be filled by nominated candidates.  Both nominees (Pat Wood and Nora Brownell) are expected to be helpful to our interests.   If we suceed in getting a U.S. district court judge to sollicit FERC's view befor the  two new nominees are seated, there may be a slight risk that members of Congress will hold their nominations hostage over the issue of how FERC answers the court.

I have copied Linda Robertson, the head of Enron's Washington shop, so that she can assess how real this risk is and whether it should influence our timing.

Richard --

I was wondering if Enron had any formal policies on the release of information?  This is promoted by a call we had from Rep. Waxman's office.  The Rep would like a copy of the 4 page handout that Lay gave to key California Republican leaders in a ""private"" meeting in Beverly Hills reported in the LA Times recently.

I think that we are going to give this information to Rep. Waxman's office, but we probably want a formal policy (ie, written) that would allow our legislative professionals in DC and elsewhere to say that some info is public and can be provided and other info will not be released.

Appreciate your help.

Jim

9.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

   Developments in the California Power Market.  During
2000, prices for wholesale electricity in California
significantly increased as a result of a combination of
factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in
available hydroelectric generation resources, increased
demand, over-reliance on the spot market for electricity and
limitations on supply.  California's regulatory regime
instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases but
froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting
disparity between costs of supply and customer revenues
caused two of California's public utilities, Pacific Gas &
Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison
Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale
power costs and certain obligations related to the
difference between third party power purchase costs and
frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and SCE have
defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain
outstanding obligations, including wholesale power purchased
through the California Power Exchange (the Power Exchange),
from the California Independent System Operator (the
Independent System Operator), and from qualifying
facilities.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each
have filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.

   Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the
energy situation in California have been implemented or are
being pursued, and may result in restructuring of markets in
California and elsewhere.  Additional initiatives are likely
at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not
possible to predict their outcome at this time.

   Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with
California utilities, the Power Exchange, the Independent
System Operator, end users of energy in California, and
other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of these
entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such
activities and believes that the combination of such
reserves in accounts receivables and price risk management
assets and other credit offsets with such parties are
adequate to cover its exposure to developments in the
California power market.  Due to the uncertainties involved,
the ultimate outcome of the California power situation
cannot be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will
not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial
condition or results of operations.

   India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting
interest in Dabhol Power Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740
megawatt power plant and is developing an additional 1,444
megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasification
facility in India.  Enron accounts for its investment in
Dabhol under the equity methodand the debt of Dabhol is non-
recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of
power from Dabhol, and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM)
and the federal government of India (GOI), the guarantors of
payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project
documents.  The contract disputes relate principally to the
failure by the MSEB to pay certain capacity and energy
payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM and GOI
to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project
documents.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able
to resolve such disputes to its favor and to successfully
collect on and to enforce any judgment or settlement.
However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actions are in
clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends
to pursue all available legal remedies under the project
documents.  Accordingly, Enron does not believe that any
contract dispute related to Dabhol would have a material
adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of
operations.

   Termination of Portland General Sales Agreement.  On
April 26, 2001, Enron announced that the previously
disclosed agreement to sell Portland General to Sierra
Pacific Resources had been terminated by the mutual consent
of both parties because the effect of developments in
California and Nevada on the purchaser had made completion
of the transaction impractical.

3. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 
Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations. 
Litigation. In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron. The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated. Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately. In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s. This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants. In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988. The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims. On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court. The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations. The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
Trojan Investment Recovery. In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan. 
The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB). 
In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant. Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation. The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000. As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment. Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order. With the CUB's withdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation. The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan. 
Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
Environmental Matters. Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites. The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses. These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations. Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities. Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

CEO | Super 180's
Made in Huddersfield England

With demand so high, and supply increasingly limited, it's a privilege to be
able to offer CEO Super 180's to our clients.  But, what exactly does make
these fabrics the finest Super 180's in the world?

New South Whales, Australia.  There, on a ranch deep in the outback, 114,000
specially bred Merino sheep are raised under strictly controlled conditions.
All are individually numbered, fed a special diet and even protected from
the elements by jackets.  Each year, a new generation of prized rams and
ewes surpasses the previous one in the quality of their wool.  Yet, at a
demanding 14.5-14.9 microns, less than 1% of total production will be judged
worthy of CEO Super 180's.

Huddersfield, England.  At Taylor & Stewart, a famed mill known for its
expertise, the longest and strongest and most supple of these wool staple
yarns are spun, woven and finished according to 400 year old tradition.
Fabrics are scoured with rainwater which travels from 60 miles away through
ancient rock to reach the mill's own 1500 foot deep well.  Unique finishing
processes truly set these fabrics apart, and are accomplished via treasured,
time-tested machinery and state of the art computerized equipment.

The result is a magnificent, superbly tailorable cloth that's actually finer
than cashmere.  Its soft, buttery hand, durability and resilience are
unparalleled in the luxury market.  Of raw materials as scarce and
painstakingly acquired as earth's rarest gems, the cost of such wools has
risen significantly.  Yet, a close partnership between Tom James and the
renowned mills of Huddersfield permits us to control costs and make CEO
Super 180's readily available to you.

Surely, a privilege you will enjoy for seasons to come.

I am unclear as to why we are taking this approach.  This discussion is nothing but a rehash of past conversations that we have had with DP.  There are no new developments to discuss.  They have threatened us and, in my opinion, are simply trying to extort advantages from us to which they are not entitled.  My suggestion is that we initiate the arbitration process and put them on the defensive.  We don't owe them any explanations because we are acting within the bounds of the agreement.  I would like to remind you that their behavior during these last several months can be called into question.  I think violations of confidentiality on their part should be discussed relating to the ""offers"" them claim to know about.  They solicited a key employee of AMPS concomitant with accusing us of violating our fiduciary responsibilities.  
 
If they feel passionately that we have behaved inappropriately, then they should move forward and avail themselves of their remedies.  Otherwise, we shouldn't waste our time or dignify their baseless allegations with yet another inane conversation.  Why do we always have to negotiate with the ""terrorists"" when we have the moral high ground?

Subject: AMPS Dispute 



    I was able to speak with Victoria Westerhaus today about her September (sic) 27, 2001 letter. Victoria said that before she would be prepared to discuss the substance of her letter she would need to speak with Tom and Wayne.  She did; however, mention that neither she nor her client understood why Enron had been so anxious to dissolve the company when her client had several potential buyers very interested in the company. She mentioned that if Enron didn't want to put any more money into AMPS, it should have worked with DP to find a buyer.
    I told Ms. Westerhaus that it was my understanding that a bona fide buyer was not lurking on the horizon and that there was no way that the company could have continued operating. She said that AMPS could have suspended operations instead of dissolving.  She then inquired as to whether the company had, in fact, been dissolved.  In response to that question, I told her that my last meeting about AMPS had been over a week a ago and I had no additional information. I then suggested a conference call between Enron, its counsel and DC and its counsel to try to bridge the parties difference's before the towels wee thrown I n.  She said she'd get with Tom and Wayne and get back to me.
    Please let me know what your schedules look like for the rest of the week.  I will call the Bracewell folks and see how theirs look.  Thanks.

Richard,

Please review the attached fax from Ben Ogletree, one of Natwest's lawyers,
especially the four attached agreements (which Natwest already has.)  Can I
represent to Natwest that these four agreements, along with the Oaktree
settlement agreement, constitute all settlement or cooperation agreements that
we have with any parties to any of NSM litigation?  If I can say that, the
issue of ECT Securities' deposition goes away.

Steve

"FW: Ontario Power litigation","
FYI
 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Liss, Kevin  
Sent:	Monday, July 09, 2001 7:12 PM
To:	Sanders, Richard B.
Subject:	Ontario Power litigation

Steve Douglas asked me to review and brief you on the pleadings for the Ontario Power tax refund litigation against the United States.  

Ontairo Power, a Canadian coal buyer, claims it is entitled to a refund of unconstitutionally imposed excise tax on coal it bought from several US producers. The IRS is apparently acknowledging that the coal excise tax is unconstitutional as applied to exported coal, and has announced that it will refund taxes improperly levied.  But at issue is whether coal buyers are properly the ones who are due the refund, or whether it more properly belongs to the coal producers.  The IRS says it is separately being sued by 40 coal suppliers, who claim entitlement to the refund, and has therefore asked that all coal producers who have sold coal to Ontario Power be given notice of this proceeding, perhaps as a precursor to an interpleader proceeding.  I presume that that is how we got copies of the pleadings that were forwarded to us.

This suggests to me that Enron should consider filing its own refund claim with respect to any exported coal we have been selling.  It would be useful to get a copy of the pleadings from some of the other producers so that we can use that as a template for our own complaint.  That would also give us a head start in researching some of the relevant legal issues.  We will also want to look at our invoicing to see whether or not the coal excise tax is separately itemized on our bill.  Finally, we will need to get records of our coal exports so we can ascertain how much money is in issue.  For how many years I am not sure; the applicable statute of limitations is one of the items that will need to be researched.   

I will be out of town for the next couple of days, but will be back on Thursday.  Perhaps we can discuss the way forward at that time.

I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release. The release may be shortlived.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Underscheduling Penalty and PG&E Bankruptcy
Claims Bar Date


IMPORTANT NOTICE
UNDERSCHEDULING PENALTY AND
PG&E BANKRUPTCY PROOF OF CLAIMS
As you are aware, the claims bar date in the PG&E bankruptcy is September
5th.  Consistent with our practice of providing information held by the ISO
to Market Participants that concerns the amounts that may be owed to them in
part by PG&E, the ISO is today sending to each Scheduling Coordinator an
accounting of the amounts it owes or is owed in the event the
underscheduling penalty is not modified by FERC.  FERC adopted the
underscheduling penalty in a December 15, 2000 Order.  Because there are
several rehearing petitions pending regarding the underscheduling penalty,
to date the ISO has calculated but has not invoiced amounts owed or owing
pursuant to the underscheduling penalty.  It is our expectation that
Scheduling Coordinators will share with individual entities for whom they
schedule, information that is relevant to them.
As we have advised in prior Market Notices, although the ISO settles
transactions on behalf of Market Participants, the ISO is neither authorized
nor in a position unilaterally to assert claims on behalf of Market
Participants in any bankruptcy proceeding, i.e. assert claims of ""ISO
Debtors"" against ""ISO Creditors"" (ISO Tariff Section 11.20.1).  Further,
while the ISO may be asked by an ""ISO Debtor"" to assert such claims in the
PX or PG&E bankruptcy cases, the ISO is not obliged to do so and will
decline any such request.  The ISO expressly disavows any liability for any
Market Participant's claims, whether or not the Market Participant files any
such proofs of claim in the PX or PG&E bankruptcy proceedings.
Further, as we have advised in prior Market Notices, all statements,
including the information sent today regarding the underscheduling penalty,
are subject to change.  A number of transactions are currently known to be
the subject of disputes and market reruns.  There are also proceedings
pending at FERC, Federal Courts, and State Courts, the outcomes of which may
affect amounts owed by PG&E to each Market Participant or by the Market
Participant to PG&E. In addition, we anticipate that further disputes and
proceedings may arise and market reruns may be performed that will affect
the calculation of such amounts.  The ISO will continue to work diligently
to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.  Nonetheless, it is clear
that significant issues may remain unresolved and/or unidentified by the
claims bar date.
Market Participants should consult their own legal COUNSEL as to their
respective rights  and proofs of claims in the bankruptcy cases of the PX
and PG&E.

Chris Boehler is the lawyer at A&K who handled the IDB Lease (the one that I gave you a copy of the other day).  Bill Neese is the lawyer for the IDB who worked across the table from Chris.  You might want to get Bill's number from Chris Boehler (Chris' direct lines is 713-220-4421) and give him a call.  I am sure that Bill is worried about who is covering his legal fees.  If memory serves me, the Lease calls for the IDB to be fully indemnified by the lessee (Gleason Power I, L.L.C.).  Please call if you need any further information.

Chris,

As you know, we have all been sued over the alleged vibrations at the
above plant by the Chamberlins.  Who will be handling this for Enron?  I
will contact Allegahny so we can coordinate the defense.

Please review and call me at your earliest convenience.

Bill

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when
hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2.   What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for
failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this
policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

I am glad to report that we have received word from Rex Sharp, the plaintiffs' lawyer in the Quinque litigation, that he intends to dismiss Enron North America Corp. from this litigation.  We provided Rex with an affidavit explaining that ENA is not a first measurer of gas, and he let us know this morning that as a result, he does not intend to pursue ENA.  I will believe it when I see the amended petition, which should be filed by the close of business tomorrow.  

I will keep you updated.

"Re: Roger Atkinson v. Cogen, et al.; Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO.","Disregard my previous messageabout this case. Thanks for your assistance in this matter.




	Bonnie White/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 12:19 PM 	   To: Rob Cole/ENRON@enronXgate, Robert Vote/ENRON@enronXgate  cc: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Roger Atkinson v. Cogen, et al.; Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO.	


This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technologies Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effective late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & English to represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  This matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  David Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to determine if any such obligations exist.

The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Cogen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have asked Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of process is in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it.  As this new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am forwarding a copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process and investigate the claim in your usual manner. 

Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.  Thanks.

The watered down letter to SCE is set out below.  Let me know if you have
any comments and if Enron is willing to sign on to the letter.  We are
trying to get this out today.  Dynegy has watered this down somewhat, but I
believe has signed off on it.  Mirant has also agreed.

Also, Gov Davis's proclamation on XXX Session is set out below.  October 9

Works for me.

Deb -- Unless you or Mark Haedicke advise otherwise, Becky Stephens will process SOP for Ste. Aurelie Timberlands as she does for other companies in the Enron Wholesale Group, i.e. Service Recipient -- Richard Sanders; Copy Recipient -- Linda Guinn; ELU Contact -- Bonnie White.

Kate -- Please confirm with Becky when the change of agent has been effected.

Deb and Kate -- During the interim, I understand that service will be handled by the current agent and notice of service will be issued by that agent to whomever Deb has designated. If that is to be Becky during this transition, Deb will need to so instruct the current agent with a copy of the instructions to Becky.

Thanks.

I understand that you have expressed a preference that service of process upon this recently acquired domestic company be received by Canadian counsel. This is contrary to the procedure that we implemented a couple of years ago, whereby a corporate agent has been assigned as agent for service of process relative to all domestic entities affiliated with Enron Corp. in all states. Currently, that agent is NRAI. 

There are two exceptions -- PGE and Limbach. Both of these companies requested and were granted exceptions to the SOP procedure for specific business needs. 

Please provide me the basis for the requested exception as to the captioned company. Of course, we will make every effort to accommodate the specific business needs of this company. Also, please advise whether you or someone on your behalf has determined that the laws in each state in which the company is incorporated and does business permits SOP on a foreign individual.

Thanks.

Andy Edison tells me we are considering using John Quinn in case EBS files an arbitration versus Qwest.  Also, we may need California counsel to file some suits for EES against some customers for breach of contract.  The amount of these claims range from $150,000 to $2 million.  I was going to propose using Shaun Morgan and Kristen Bird, who did outstanding jobs on the UC/CSU case, to handle these.

you received, and we discussed, the replies we filed in support of the
half-dozen motions to dismiss and/or strike (and a sanctions motion) filed by the enron defendants.  replies were also filed by the mcdonald and sdi defendants in support of their respective motions to dismiss and/or strike, copies of which you should have received.  their briefs are more complicated than ours, but so are their facts.  an oral hearing on these motions is currently scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on September 10th.  The court has ordered no discovery until at least these motions are heard.

if you need any further detail, or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Richard -

I have a company with whom we are negotiating a non-disclosure agreement.  We have been working off of their form, but have inserted our arbitration language.  We have put in New York as the operative law and they have responded with either Minnesota (their home jurisdiction) or Delaware (the state of their incorporation).  I have told them that Minnesota will not work and that we prefer NY, but they are holding the line on having Delaware.

Do we have a problem with Delaware for jurisdiction?  Also, this is a non-disclosure agreement and any subsequent  agreement would have to be negotiated as to forum.

Thanks for your response.

Natwest, McDonald, and PaineWebber have collectively offered the
Farallon/Oaktree plaintiffs (and maybe Legg Mason, I am not sure) $13 million
to settle.  It is clear that this group hopes to persuade SDI and Enron to
contribute something to such a settlement, but they told Hennegan that they
would fund the full $13 million themselves if necessary.  Hennegan is asking
for something in the ""high $20s""  I am advised that the settlement group is
prepared to go to the high teens, but it is not clear how much further.

I do not know the allocation of the $13 million among Natwest and McDonald,
except that I believe that Natwest is NOT paying the lion's share, as one
might expect.

If the bargaining proceeds, I am sure that someone will ask Enron to
contribute.

I would like to do it sooner, but Mr. Manne has informed me that, due to his busy social calendar, he is not available before then.  We will plan on beginning at around 7 p.m. Please let me know if you can attend.

possible.  Last Thursday, we took new space at 45 Rockefeller Plaza and
ordered all new computer systems.  Friday we got hold of the computers
and over the weekend they were installed.  By Monday, we were had phones

The Rio Piedras Explosion Litigation note needs to be updated. My suggested note follows with deletions being noted by ""***"" and additions noted in bold.  Please let me know if you have any questions are comments.

____________ 

On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in *** the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties *** agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants *** agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trail in the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001. No cases have yet been scheduled for trail in the Superior Court. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

3. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 
Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations. 
Litigation. In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron. The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated. Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately. In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s. This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants. In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988. The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims. On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court. The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations. The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been settled. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
Trojan Investment Recovery. In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan. 
The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB). 
In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant. Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation. The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000. As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment. Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order. With the CUB's withdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation. The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan. 
Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
Environmental Matters. Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites. The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses. These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations. Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities. Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

Subject:	plaintiff's opposition briefs in the schultes matter

on Friday, plaintiff filed two briefs: one omnibus brief in oppostion to all of the substantive motions filed by all of the defendants, and another brief in opposition to the 2 sanctions motions, one filed by us and the other by mcdonald.  the briefs are littered with expressions of indignation and outrage, and dwell on plaintiff's counsel's condemnation of large firms and large clients willing to expend any amount of money and hours to bury the plaintiff - and the court - in paper.  as to actual substance, the briefs are very light, as well as confusing.

specifically w/r to the issues raised by the enron motions, plaintiff presumably took the omnibus approach to further blur the distinctions between the defendants, and obscure the fact that he didn't make particular allegations about any enron conduct. obviously, this will be a core focus of our response.

copies will be fed ex'd to you all overnight.   if you have any comments, reactions, or suggestions, please call.  otherwise we hope to have  draft replies to you all by the end of the week.  our filing date is a week from today.

Subject:	Form Settlement Agreement

Richard -

I have a small contract matter involving Enron Credit that requires a settlement agreement.

Basically, EC orally agreed to have a third party develop and host a website that would provide the EC information to site subscribers.  These subscribers might also be subscribers to other products promoted by the third party.  The written agreement backing up the oral agreement was due to be finalized on Friday of last week, but, as you can imagine was not actually signed.

As EC is not pursuing its business at this time, it has asked to terminate the relationship with this third party - a termination that will cost $96K.

I have been asked to do a settlement agreement and was wondering if there is any particular form that Enron uses or that you may have for this type of deal.  It is rather simple in nature, but we do want to make sure that all necessary release language is included.

Thanks.

Mark

Subject:	Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal

DJ Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal<ENE.N><MSFT.O>
   By Michael Rieke
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

    HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling
was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for
his company's foundering broadband business.

    Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth
for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron
would give more details on the deal later.

    After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence
by suing Microsoft.

    In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron
claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal.

    The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide
network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed
Internet service, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for
use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the
deal, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal,
so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal,
the lawsuit said.

Where do we stand on Guido's compensation for his most recent activity. It appears he holds a strong interest in this matter but I think it is best to cap his efforts on our behalf before we get a substantial bill for multiple political outcome analysis.

Richard I would suggest Andy call Guido and define where we are cost wise and define the box as of today.

Granite Power Partners 


ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION; PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

Tom and Mike:

As you may know, NEPCO and the project Owners are named in a personal injury
lawsuit that was served on NEPCO earlier this month in Cook County,
Illinois.  I tender the case by letter to Dick Corp for their defense and
indemnity since it involved one their employees who broke his leg on the
jobsite in Kendall, Illinois.  I cited paragraph 4 (b) and (d) of the JVA as
my authority for shifting the risk to Dick, however was silent on Paragraph
11 and 19 which actually says we should have purchased a GL policy for the
JV to protect the JV and its partners.  As a cost saving measure agreed by
the JV partners, no policy was purchase because each Dick and NEPCO would
rely on the GL policy of their own (Dick's and Enron's) to protect
themselves against third party claims. Paragraph 19 is an indemnity which
states the JV partners share risk 50/50 without respect to who is at fault
except for willful actions.  It also states the JV will indemnify the JV
members, which only works if the JV had purchased a GL policy and in the
absence of a GL policy then the intent would be that each party will utilize
the others GL policy and share in the deductible cost.  Dick has responded
in writing and said it will defend and indemnity NEPCO through its GL policy
(Travelers) but says the JV partners must share in their $250,000
deductible, or $125K per partner.  That hurts, but not as bad as if this
were handled by Enron's policy which has a self insured deductible of $2
Million.

In the end, I agree to some extent with Dick's response for pure third party
claims, but I have some trouble with the concept of claims coming from their
own employees of which they would have immunity from suit under the workers
compensation act.  Dick pays up to it's cap on liability under the WC act
and then theoretically has 50% deductible liability under the GL policy for
claims against the other JV partner.  Had this not been a JV relationship,
we would have had Dick paying all of the defense and indemnity as a
subcontractor.  The JVA is silent on this split in liability for claims by
either parties' own employees, however, I look back to the paragraphs I
cited to Roger Peters (Par. 4 (b) and (d)) and they say with respect to
subcontracts, of which Dick and NEPCO were expected to perform their
respective scopes of work under (see 4 (b)), each such subcontract shall
oblige the subcontractor to indemnify the JV and each of the parties from
and against all expense, liability and claims resulting from its
construction/engineering work.  This language would say that Dick should
take 100% of the claim.  

The bottom line, the JVA is vague in respect to claims by its own employees.
If this were the only claim, I would say lets share the loss because the
benefit and exposure flows both ways.  In reality though, most if not all of
the claims will come from construction workers (Dick employees).  So sharing
the loss is not reasonable especially since the Travelers lawyer has said
the common practice of Union hired employees in the Chicago area is to bring
numerous accident injury claims against owners and GCs as the project winds
down.  He said to expect more claims like this because he sees this on other
Dick jobs.

Gail and Bob,  This message is more for informational purposes since the
claim has been accepted by Dick Corp although Travelers did not afford me
much selection of counsel since they went ahead and assigned it to a Chicago
lawyer, Chic Marasa.  His number and address is:  (312) 345-7229, Law
offices of Chic Marasa, One East Wacker Drive, Suite 3450, Chicago, Illinois
60601.  We may want to have one of you monitor the outside lawyer hired by
Travelers and make sure our interests are served.  I sent the complaint and
my tender letter to Richard Sanders on August 10th.  Gail,  I spoke to Chic
and he sounds nice, single and available if you are interested. Juuust
kidding.

This is clearly a crisis of international proportion.  We will obviously

At the risk of sounding irreverent, however, timing in California remains
critical.  We would very much like to have Enron on board in the event we
file an involuntary petition today or early tomorrow.

THIRD request!  Many of you haven't granted calendar access rights to our Legal Dept. Temporary IDs.  The temporaries that fill in for our Assistants need this access not only to set up meetings and keep your calendars current, but to refer to in case there's an emergency and you need to be found.

Assistants:  It is helpful if you block the time on your bosses' calendars for their vacations and trips.  That way when we call up the calendars the temps won't have to guess how to answer their calls.   (""I don't know where they are"" is not an acceptable answer!)

Please follow the instructions below. 

For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Subject: York Paper v. Enron/Holzer



Privileged and Confidential

Gail,

I had a productive conversation with Keith Dutill, the Stradley lawyer who
I've known for decades and who is now representing York Paper.

The short of it is that he said he is very interested in trying to resolve
this before the litigation machinery cranks up.  He will discuss it with his
client and get back to me.  He said that York has ""strong feelings"" and then
agreed with me that Enron feels the same way.  He felt that York has a ""good
business sense"" and would be interested in reaching a compromise without
spending a lot of dollars in legal fees.

Dutill does not know why two separate summons were filed in Delaware County.
It's his understanding that the claims against Enron are largely the same as
the claims against Holzer (with perhaps one or two exceptions that still
relate to Holzer's employment with Enron).  He is working on a complaint
that will cover both summons, and expects to file it in the next several
weeks, certainly before the mediation conference on November 19th.  I said
that we should try to start our own discussions before that mediation
conference so that the mediator could focus on any areas of disagreement.

Here's how Dutill described York's claims:  Holzer worked for York Paper.
When Holzer left York, York wanted to prevent Holzer from working for Enron.
Holzer wanted to work for Enron, and so did Enron, so there was some
""agreement"" between Holzer/Enron and York.  In that ""agreement"", Holzer and
Enron made ""promises"" about the way they ""would do business"" with York.  It
appears that the promise was that Holzer and Enron would not bypass York
Paper and deal directly with York Paper's customers.  Yet, according to
Dutill, that is what Holzer and Enron did -- cut out York Paper as the
middle man.  This has resulted in a ""fair erosion of business"" for York
Paper.  It is ""not just a matter of subsequent solicitation.""  It also
involves ""interference with existing contracts"" between York and its
customers. 

So, it would seem that York's claims might include breach of contract,
interference with contractual relations and, perhaps,
misrepresentation/fraud.  Interestingly, he did not mention any of the West
Coast and Garden State Paper contracts we have been looking into.

If you have any thoughts, please let me know.  I will keep you informed of
any further developments.

Bob

I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson (an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.

Subject:	Official Participants Committee and Unofficial Energy Sellers Committee

Richard, please call me so we can discuss directly the question of  
arbitration against SCE for the PX claim of $824 million.  I think its  
important and I would like to discuss it with you personally. 
Second, I am representing Enron's sub, Portland General Electric Company, on  
the Unofficial Committee of Energy Sellers that has about 20 members.  12 of  
the members have voted to send a low key, non threatening message to the  
Calif legislature on the pending AB78X to the effect that if they pass a bill  
that leaves SCE $1 bill short in financing, then other energy sellers (you  
and I know or can guess who they are) will probably feel forced to start an  
involuntary bankruptcy or to start litigation against SCE.  The Unofficial  
Committee was formed to not threaten or pursue bankruptcy or litigation, but  
to pursue consensual repayment.  By creating a cloud of uncertainty over  
whether and when others will start the involuntary bankruptcy, the rating  
agencies and underwriters may not be willing to financing SCE even at the  
reduced rate set forth in the proposed bill.  The 12 members of the  
Unofficial Committee that want to send this message want SCE to avoid a  
Bankruptcy and therefore are suggesting that the Legislature, if it passes AB  
78X, may actually be making it more likely that a BK will ensue. 
Apparently, Doug Nichols at Portland General talked to Lisa Mellencamp about  
this and was told that Portland General should not be part of this low key,  
non threatening message.   
I would like to talk to you directly about this too.  I want to make sure  
that Enron is not missing several opportunities here that will help Enron and  
others.  Please give me a call sometime.  I will be in Sacramento on Tues Sep  
4, but will call you when and where you say. 
I asked Nelson to find out if you would be around to actively participate on  
a subcommittee of the Official Committee on SCE (Sempra and Powerex would be  
the other subcommittee members).  Last time I put you on  a subcommittee, on  
fees, you were too busy to participate.  Please let me know if you really can  
be involved on this important subcommittee on SCE. 
thanks.

"FW: California Refund Proceeding Privileged and Confidential Attorney Work Product Attorney-Client Communication","

Subject:	California Refund Proceeding Privileged and Confidential Attorney Work Product Attorney-Client Communication

In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.  However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.  

At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.  As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty.  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.

The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.

Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding.

Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.

Subject:	PX Participants Committee

I would like to try and schedule a convenient time to discuss with you the
role/scope of the PX Participants Committee.  Reliant has been concerned
for some time about the continued life line of the PX and this committee
and the additional layer of expenses that are being incurred (see BDO's
recent analysis of the PX budget for example).  It seems to me that the
sole role of the PX and the committee (other than with respect to
litigation that has already commenced such as the commandeering litigation)
aught to be limited to (i) record/data retention and (ii) finalizing
accounting issues so that each participant has a certification of how much
it is owed by each defaulting IOU.  The PX seems to have lost its ""pass
through"" nature, which is critical to each participant being able to asset
its claims directly.   I am particularly concerned that the committee,
through its professionals is beginning to have a life of its own.

It would be useful to have this discussion prior to the committee meeting
tomorrow afternoon.  Are you available after 10 a.m. central time tomorrow
to discuss?

At this meeting wwe will discuss the trial plan and, in effect, have a dry run of what we might expect to occur during the October 11 trial.  Please let me know if you are available to attend. I have also asked that, by the end of this week, Brobeck provide us with a summary of the best arguments for and against both sides and an analysis of the realistic exposure to both sides. We can review this before the meeting on the 21st. 
	Also, the two motions for summary judgment we filed are set to be heard on October 1, 2001. The outcome of this hearing (assuming the judge makes a ruling) could certainly affect the tone and scope of the case. Please let me know if you are available on the 21st.  Thanks.

I participated in the conference call that Phil Warden put together regarding SCE.  The call was brief, lasting about 20 minutes.  Reliant suggested that an approach be made to SCE's lawyers to ask them what their plans are in light of the apparent failure of the MOU.  The parties on the line agreed to this suggestion, and this Wednesday, 9/19 at 9:30 was tentatively set for a call with SCE's counsel.  Phil will confirm the call and circulate the dialin information.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: ""the palace coup."" 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
""I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,"" said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt ""betrayed"" by the actions of Winter. 
""The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,"" Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
""It was an emergency,"" Fishman said. 
""We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
""They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,"" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
""All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
""If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to ""fix"" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
""In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
""The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. ""It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business."" 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
""We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. ""In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."" 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
""Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
""He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."" 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
""They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
""They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."" 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
""We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,"" Dunn said. ""Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Good luck on your company's adventure.  I  can't think of a better person to direct Enron's defense.  You will be  happy to know we turned down an untruthful proxy statement,  1933, and 1934 act  case.  (Actually, you probably wish a nit-wit like me got the  cases.)

Subject:	Campbell Hearing

There was telephonic oral argument today before Judge Whaley on the filed
rate issues in Campbell v. SDGE.  It went very well.  Judge Whaley began by
asking Campbell to argue first, since ""It seems to me you're flying in the
face of the filed rate doctrine.""  The bulk of the argument focused on two
issues:  (1) what if anything is the effect of FERC's inability to issue
retroactive rate relief, and (2) (to a much lesser extent) how a class
action based on SDGE customers only avoided the discrimination prong of the
doctrine.  Campbell's argument was ineffective, consisting mostly of his
preferred social policy rather than any law.  His most substantive argument
was that filed rate was based on a res judicata-like theory, and since
market-based rates are not passed on by FERC before they go into effect, and
can't changed be retroactively, resort to the courts was appropriate.

I was not asked any specific questions at first, but was rather just asked
to respond.  I began by advising the court of the July 25th order in which
FERC held that filed rate applied to these market-based rates, then
discussed Norwood, then addressed the res judicata analogy by pointing to
the cases that hold that mere filing, rather than agency review, invokes the
doctrine.  Whaley asked me a couple of questions about retroactive relief,
the most significant of which was along the following lines:  ""So what you
are saying is that if, at the end of the day, it is determined that there is
no right of retroactive relief, then that's just like a statute of
limitations or any other limitation on a right or remedy that doesn't effect
FERC's jurisdiction.""  I answered affirmatively, stating that the salient
point was that it was within Congress' power to decide how this type of
interstate commerce was to be regulated, and that if Congress imposed
limitations on remedies for illegal behavior, we were all bound by that.  He
seemed content with that answer.

Campbell replied in an argument that was pretty close to saying, ""There must
always be a remedy somewhere.""  Interestingly, Whaley then asked Campbell a
couple of times whether he would concede Keogh's applicability if there was
a FERC remedy.  I think this was a setup, and Campbell walked into it,
basically saying yes.  Whaley didn't close the trap, but it would not
surprise me if he finds that the existence of a remedy at the agency doesn't
matter, and since Campbell admits that Keogh would bar the claim if there
were a remedy, he's out of court.

Whaley took it under submission and said he would issue an order.  I think
he'll rule very narrowly, stressing that Campbell's is a claim under the
FPA.  I tried to broaden his thinking, arguing that we ought not allow every
plaintiff to attempt to reinvent the regulatory system by dreaming up every
manner of legal attack on filed rates, but I suspect he saw through that and
will rule narrowly.  Anyway, I expect a good result.

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this matter, please contact Dave. 

Thanks.

 -----Original Message-----

To:	Sanders, Richard B.
Subject:	Ontario Power litigation

Steve Douglas asked me to review and brief you on the pleadings for the Ontario Power tax refund litigation against the United States.  

Ontairo Power, a Canadian coal buyer, claims it is entitled to a refund of unconstitutionally imposed excise tax on coal it bought from several US producers. The IRS is apparently acknowledging that the coal excise tax is unconstitutional as applied to exported coal, and has announced that it will refund taxes improperly levied.  But at issue is whether coal buyers are properly the ones who are due the refund, or whether it more properly belongs to the coal producers.  The IRS says it is separately being sued by 40 coal suppliers, who claim entitlement to the refund, and has therefore asked that all coal producers who have sold coal to Ontario Power be given notice of this proceeding, perhaps as a precursor to an interpleader proceeding.  I presume that that is how we got copies of the pleadings that were forwarded to us.

This suggests to me that Enron should consider filing its own refund claim with respect to any exported coal we have been selling.  It would be useful to get a copy of the pleadings from some of the other producers so that we can use that as a template for our own complaint.  That would also give us a head start in researching some of the relevant legal issues.  We will also want to look at our invoicing to see whether or not the coal excise tax is separately itemized on our bill.  Finally, we will need to get records of our coal exports so we can ascertain how much money is in issue.  For how many years I am not sure; the applicable statute of limitations is one of the items that will need to be researched.   

I will be out of town for the next couple of days, but will be back on Thursday.  Perhaps we can discuss the way forward at that time.

Subject:	More information re the claim of Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc. against EES

Vicki, a few weeks ago a friend of mine, Steve Greenwald (a partner in Davis Wright Tremaine's San Francisco office), called to tell me that one of his clients, Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc., had entered into an agreement with an Enron entity, and was claiming that Enron had breached that agreement.  This client is allegedly preparing to file a petition against us.  Steve told his client that DWT could not represent Texas-Ohio in litigation against Enron, and Steve asked me to try to find out what agreement his client might be talking about (at that time, Steve did not have a copy of the agreement).  Steve asked his client to produce the agreement, and at the same we checked throughout Enron for the agreement (Vicki, you checked around and couldn't find any agreement between EES and Texas-Ohio).  We weren't even sure which Enron entity was involved.  We did kick around my proposal that Steve might be able to serve as a mediator between Texas-Ohio and Enron, to attempt to settle the dispute without litigation.

Now we have the agreement, and it is with EES.  I will send it to you when I get a good-quality copy (which is being sent to me today).  From my almost-illegible faxed copy, It is a Client Commission Agreement between EES and Texas-Ohio, Inc., dated October 13, 2000.  Timonthy J. Hamilton signed as Attorney-in-Fact for EES; there are no lawyers' initials on the execution block.  Texas-Ohio is entitled to recommend to EES prospective commercial and industrial customers served by SoCal, SDG&E, SWG (Southwest Gas), and PG&E.  If EES enters into an agreement with any such identified customers, Texas-Ohio earns a commission.  There are provisions concerning price quoting and commission calculation; I'm sure you are familiar with those.

I am not familiar with this agreement or the extent of its use, and I do not yet know the nature of Texas-Ohio's claim, although I would suspect it is for non-payment of commissions allegedly due.  I will forward the agreement to you, and I'll stand by to help on this, should you want me to.   And Steve Greenwald would be happy to try to broker a peace, if that offer becomes attractive (I'd be happy to introduce you to him, or to work with him, as you wish).

Sheila, this is FYI so that you'll know what's happened on this matter.  It's been a while since we discussed it.  Richard, this is FYI also, inasmuch as this could lead to litigation.

Thank you, 

Kenton

I really don't want to be out in front of the client, particularly in a case in which I myself cringe at the creative ways lawyers are coming up with to keep themselves busy.  When I couldn't reach you before the committee conference, I called Lisa to ascertain whether she still was in the PX loop.  We talked about the committee call.  She actually participated for the first few minutes to express her view that our committee should not be filing in formal motion to expand the PG & E committee.  We briefly discussed the arbitration issue, and she did not appear adverse to commencement of the arbitration.  Maybe that wasn't formal clearance to vote.  Lesson learned.  I want to avoid any such problem in the future.  Unless I hear otherwise from you, on substantive issues I won't vote until I clear positions with you personally.  However, we have to find a better way for me to get your take on particular points because they will continue to arise as Weg and Cohen (not to mention other attorneys who participate on the committee) urge the committee to take actions in the interest of discharging our fiduciary duty.  Case in point, the Weg settlement.  Have you decided whether to withdraw the approval you previously communicated.  If it would help the communication, I'm perfectly willing to talk with you evenings or weekends.  Then again, you wife might react like mine if her privacy at home is interrupted.  In any event, assuming that Enron wants to stay on the committee, probably a good idea just to reign in the lawyers, let me know how we can most effectively communicate so that I know your position and can convey it when you are not available for a call.  Incidentally, with you impending trip, feel free to call me over the weekend at 626-683-7644 if you want to discuss this further.  Bob

The State Enron Records to Stay Secret Court: A judge orders confidentiality for the power firm's documents. A Senate panel probing electricity price gouging has subpoenaed them.

SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp., the giant Texas-based seller of electric power, won a court ruling Thursday in its quest to guarantee the secrecy of hundreds of thousands of internal business documents sought by state lawmakers. 
A Senate committee investigating price gouging in California's wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enron's documents in April, seeking records of electricity sales, bidding strategies, prices and out-of-state transactions.
The company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records. Enron sued July 11, and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C. Kobayashi granted the company's request for a protective order. 
The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of the California Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of the state's two largest utilities last January. 
""Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition with plaintiff,"" wrote Kobayashi, ""the functions of the Senate and the Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict, actual conflicts can arise."" 
Kobayashi's order is a reversal of an earlier, tentative ruling, in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be an ""unacceptable"" intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the Legislature. 
Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based company, described executives as ""very pleased"" with the court ruling. ""Turning over the documents was never the issue,"" she said, ""The issue was always protecting our rights."" 
Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides, Denne said. 
Reliant Energy of Houston, another company that resisted demands for business records, on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with Dunn's committee and will begin bringing 250,000 documents to a depository in Sacramento, said Reliant spokesman Marty Wilson. 
Dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to Sacramento, but not all are fully complying with subpoenas. 
""There are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market participants,"" he said. 
On July 21, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market voted to recommend that Enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents. 
The full Senate has yet to vote on that recommendation. 
The committee, which the Senate created in March, has focused its investigation on the private companies that purchased power plants after California moved to deregulate its electricity market in 1996.

California judge says no to Enron subpoena
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Enron Corp. received a protective order Thursday for documents subpoenaed by a California state Senate committee. 
Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi ruled that Houston-based Enron can prevent the legislative panel from sharing information in the thousands of documents relating to energy trading in California. 
""Once the confidential information is disclosed, no amount of sanctions will be able to rectify the damage that might be caused,"" Kobayashi wrote in his order. 
The Senate committee requested documents including e-mails, phone logs, financial records and records of any Enron ""trading strategies."" The panel is probing whether generators manipulated the power market. 

Enron Wins Document Protection Order From Calif Judge

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Sacramento Superior Court judge Thursday ruled that Enron Corp (ENE) must comply with a legislative subpoena of financial documents, but reversed an earlier decision and granted the company a protective order of the documents, according to a copy of the ruling seen by Dow Jones Newswires.
Enron said the ruling was a victory, as the company has always maintained it would be happy to comply with the subpoena by the state Senate committee as long as the company received a protective order. 
""We are obviously very happy with the ruling and look forward to working with the committee to come up with a protective order that truly protects our proprietary information,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Senate Select Committee To Investigate Market Manipulation has already cited Enron and Reliant Energy, Inc (REI) with contempt for refusing to provide documents, a charge for which the companies could be fined. 
Once Enron and the committee draft a protective order and the judge agrees to it, the company will hand over any documents that the committee wants, Palmer said. 
However, an attorney for the committee expressed skepticism that the company would actually follow through. 
""We have no indication from Enron that they would agree to produce the documents we've requested, even with the confidentiality order,"" said Larry Drivon, special counsel to the committee. 
He added that he could not speculate if the committee would drop its contempt charge if Enron did produce all requested documents. 
In his decision granting the protective order, Judge Charles Kobayashi wrote that he was not convinced the committee has solid standards in place to ensure Enron's protection. 
""It is clear that there are no standards for determining what are the available protections, no procedure for determining what is a legitimately confidential, privileged, proprietary matter, no procedure for oversight and no prescribed remedy for (Enron) for any unauthorized disclosures,"" Kobayashi wrote. 
Last week, a San Francisco Superior Court judge granted Enron a protective order in a separate investigation by the state attorney general.

USA: Enron must give documents to Calif. lawmakers-judge.

09/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the state's energy crisis, a California judge ruled on Thursday. 
But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement, saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firm's right to maintain proprietary secrets.
""If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest, then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights, attorneys to surrender their attorney-client privilege, (and) psychiatrists to surrender their privileges,"" the judge wrote. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity during the state's energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold. 
Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its industries. 
An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents, but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets, for example, would be protected under a confidentiality agreement. 
The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. 
""We are pleased with the judge's order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected,"" Denne said. ""The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents."" 
The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc. for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents. It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since 1929, but has not yet come up for a vote. 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. however, avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements, open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents there relating to the company's recent business in California. 
Sacramento judge says committee must protect Enron documents

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation of wholesale energy prices, a judge ruled Thursday, but the state must give the energy company a confidentiality agreement. 
Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said in his ruling that he wasn't convinced that the Senate committee ""will be able to maintain the petitioner's right to confidentiality.""
The Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market subpoenaed documents from six energy companies as they investigated last year's price spikes in the wholesale electricity market. 
If the committee went forward without a confidentiality agreement, Kobayashi said, it could then require the same of newspapers, attorneys or psychiatrists. 
Enron's motion to quash the subpoenas were dismissed last week and the judge reaffirmed that ruling Thursday. Another Enron motion seeking an injunction against the committee will be heard Wednesday. 
Company spokeswoman Karen Denne called the protective order ruling a victory. ""This gives us the confidentiality agreement we've been seeking."" 
The order's specifics will be worked out with Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee chairman. It will then be signed by a judge, once both sides agree. 
Enron officials have offered to turn over 25,000 documents that were already in California, but refused to comply with the rest of the subpoena. 
The committee found Enron in contempt for not turning over all the requested documents. A full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full Senate, which has not voted on it. A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. 
A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.

Dear Michelle, 

The Superintendencia General del SIRESE (Bolivia) just send me the background of the Transredes case in which they are requesting my advise. 

It is an administrative appeal before said agency of resolutions SSDH Nbr. 0257/2000 and 0014/2001 concerning the assesment of a fine of 710.000 bolivianos due to an oil spill and the rejection of the appeal filed before the Hidrocarbons Agency.  

As mentioned in our conference call, I informed the Superintendencia General about my assistance to Enron in different matters and they expressed no concern about the independence of my advise nor potential conflicts of interest. Please be kind enough to confirm me that Enron acknowledges that no conflict of interest arises of my eventual assistance to the Superintendencia General cocerning this matter and, therefore, that it has no objection in order for me to provide such assistance.

With the FERC evidentiary hearings coming up soon for California and with investigations into NW power markets I want to make sure that the litigation team's activities and government affair's activities are coordinated.  Is this being done?  Is there a formal process?  If there are data issues or data that you need I would like to get those issues on the table right now.  Specifically, do we have all of the data that we need (for both of your purposes) and do the people on the litigation team have a detailed understanding of this data?  There are only a few people who understand how all of our data fits together and what each type of transaction means.  As the investigation move from Californa to the Northwest markets I may have to get other people from the desk involved.

Attached is a copy of the Offer of Settlement that will be proposed by the
Official Committee of Participant Creditors in the chapter 11 case for the
California Power Exchange Corporation.

As FERC's July 25 Order requires Judge Birchman to make recommendations
regarding the amounts owed by each IOU to each Seller and to apply the
methodologies required to make these determinations, the Offer of Settlement
will have to be presented to Judge Birchman as part of the ongoing
proceedings, at the appropriate time.  In addition, the Offer of Settlement
will be presented to the bankruptcy court in CalPX's  chapter 11 case at or
about the same time it is presented to FERC.

We are forwarding the attached copy of the Offer of Settlement to you with
the understanding that it will not be distributed to any person or entity
other than the attorneys listed above and the appropriate business contacts
at their respective clients.  Our discussions regarding the Offer of
Settlement will be much more effective if we can prevent the Offer from
becoming generally available to the public, including to those who might
oppose the Offer, before it is actually filed.

Please review the attached copy of the Offer of Settlement and send me your
comments and suggestions.  We would like to have your support for the Offer.
Perhaps it would be most efficient for Ron Carroll to schedule a conference
call to discuss the Offer in more detail.  Please let me know.

Subject:	Bev's Conversation w/Dunne

Dunne told Bev that he (the committee?) intends to take up the contempt vote against us as soon as possible in September.  Apparently, he thinks they will prevail in Superior Court.  
He also said that, even though there's been alot of paper submitted by the generators, it's his sense that many are not in compliance and that more tussles are likely.  
Finally, he said that he suspects that generators will sue the committee when the committee starts the deposition process in September.

Best,
Jeff

This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
 
The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.

Jim - 
 
It has been several years since  we've visited, and there are a couple of areas I'd like to update with you  on.  I'm hopeful, after reading the following, that you will feel it  is worthwhile for us to get together again.
 
First, my last litigation project at  Fulbright & Jaworski just came to a close very unexpectedly, due  to a third party stay order, and I am once again looking for new matters to work  on.  I have attached my updated resume for your reference, or to pass on to  others in your Law Department who might have needs for my type of skills on a  project basis.  At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I've mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats.
 
Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a ""Legal Information Counsel"" position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.   
 
I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.  
 
I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.  
 
I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.

The attachment to Ms. Sager's letter did not come with the copy you
forwarded to me, but the text you proposed seems to me to say everything
necessary, and I'm generally in favor of not saying anything more than that.

Section 15.2 of the Unisil agreement gives an address for notices.  If
Unisil Aquisition is still using that address, I would send the notice
there.  Otherwise, I would make sure it gets to Unisil's management.

   you received, and we discussed, the replies we filed in support of the
   half-dozen motions to dismiss and/or strike (and a sanctions motion)
   filed by the enron defendants.  replies were also filed by the mcdonald
   and sdi defendants in support of their respective motions to dismiss
   and/or strike, copies of which you should have received.  their briefs
   are more complicated than ours, but so are their facts.  an oral hearing
   on these motions is currently scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on September 10th.
   The court has ordered no discovery until at least these motions are
   heard.

Subject:	Methodology for Allocating Missed SCE and PGE Payments

As promised, here is my outline of a proposed methodology for allocating the
losses arising from the payments not made to CalPX by SCE and PGE:

1) All participants should be returned to the position they were in before
CalPX issued invoices based on the 90 day charge back provisions in the
tariff.  This will implement the rescission of the 90 day charge back
methodology ordered by FERC.

2) The losses arising from payments not made by a particular buyer for power
purchased during a particular period will be shared pro rata among the
sellers that sold electricity during that period based on the amounts the
sellers are owed for that particular period.

3) The CalPX will not apply any charge back or default allocation to
payments and losses applicable to the real time market for which the CalPX
acts as Scheduling Coordinator.  Instead, CalPX will collect the payments,
if any, and pass them on to the ISO, subject to whatever administrative
charges CalPX is authorized to deduct by the CalPX or ISO tariffs.  Only the
ISO tariff will apply to allocate the losses from payments not made for
power sold and purchased on the real time market.

4) Any payments presently held or hereafter collected and expressly
designated for a particular period and buyer will be applied to the period
and buyer for which such payments are designated.  Any payments presently
held or hereafter collected that are not designated for a particular period
will be applied to the oldest missed payments by the buyer that subsequently
made the payment or on account of which the payment was subsequently
collected.

As I have maintained, this methodolgy may not be perfect for everyone, but,
assuming that it works, it has the appeal of being both simple and
principled.  The CalPX has indicated that it will provide us with feedback
on our approach, but will not formally endorse any particular methodology
because of its concern that it must remain neutral and not appear to support
any group of participants against any other group of participants.

As I have also maintained, until a simple and principled methodology is
adopted, it will be difficult to make any progress with the return of the
letters of credit and the distribution of the funds in the custodial and
escrow accounts.

I believe we should agree upon a workable methodology and then file a motion
with the bankruptcy court on notice to all participants to have the CalPX
authorized and directed to adopt and implement the methodology.  The
participants can then take the order to Judge Moreno to release the letters
of credit and escrowed funds and to FERC to have it formally amend the
tariffs to incorporate the methodology.

Please review the methodology outlined above with your clients so that we
can discuss it in detail during our next conference call.

Thanks.

I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
you.

Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's
Lagrave Field.

"Enron v. Calpine","Have we received a settlement offer? I saw Kevin Presto yesterday and he asked me about it. Lets talk today.
----- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 06/05/2001 06:01 AM -----


	""Bill W. Ogden"" <bogden@ogwb.com> 05/31/2001 10:02 AM Please respond to bogden 	   To: ""Andy Edison"" <andrew.edison@enron.com>  cc: ""Bonnie White"" <bonnie.white@enron.com>, ""Laura Gibson"" <lgibson@ogwb.com>, ""Richard Sanders"" <richard.b.sanders@enron.com>  Subject: Enron v. Calpine	



	Andy:

	To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpine
matter.

	I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone on
Friday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the office
until May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.
I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was
""working on"" getting me a reply.

	We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make a
settlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion to
compel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its power
purchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for a
protective order which would limit their production to the contracts in
ERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 11. Second, we won our motion
to continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summary
judgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but the
court ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of its
ruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Our
supplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 22.  Third,
Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order from
the court requiring us to produce additional information on our damage
claim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which we
detailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to update
some of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman's
deposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this.

	Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon's
deposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduled
for June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In addition
to the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleading
amendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. We
have already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We have
drafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the case
was removed from state court and we were still on the state court original
petition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleading
ambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsic
evidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative.

	I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to our
settlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if you
have questions or comments on any of these matters.

	Best regards,

	Bill

REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE
 
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at ""[no] more than 50%..."" (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.

We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
 
The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.

As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers.

Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing.
We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case.
To the extent we have customers on our filings, we have a much better shot at winning. I have gotten agreements form a number of other ESPs who will join with us.  They are: APSES, Strategic Energy, AES/New Energy, American Utility Network, and perhaps Commonwealth. Each of these, in turn, is working to get some of their customers to sign on. I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join.
Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date.
If you have customers intersted in signing on, please let me know.  The customer may contact me or the attorneys directly.  Here is contact info:

Subject:	Hi

First of all, it sounds like the Perd clean-up is good for everyone except
John.  So it is a go.

As for the Sanders' children Christmas...noone really came back with many
suggestions....so we still don't know what we are doing.  Although all of our
kids want for nothing.....it was still nice to say to my kids...that your
uncles did this for you. I don't have any ideas that I am trying to
sell....just trying to coordinate the effort.

A thought I do have is to have each family adopt a room and redo/refresh its
appearance.  Mom would like to see some of the rooms repainted...and this
could all be coordinated together....just a little redo would be a nice
touch.

However, that being said...I am still looking for ideas.

The last thing on my list is Mom.  She turns 70 in 13 days.  She is taking
three friends to the Perd...Betty, Jane and Lucy to play bridge.  Steve and
my family are headed for a short visit with them on Saturday the 15th.  Is
anyone planning a gift for her.  Does anyone have a suggestion.

OK, I won't bug you again.....

Subject:	Casey, John A. v. Nepco

Mr. Derrick, I am directing this email to your attention at the request of Mr. Jim Bouillion for consideration of extending coverage to Nepco, pursuant to the EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT on our Directors & Officers policy.

We have reviewed the Petition wherein a former iron worker of Nepco alleges damages as a result of being terminated, in violation of Title 85 O.S. d 5.  The Plaintiff sustained an on the job injury on April 6, 2001, when he was struck by a crane.  He received workers compensation benefits.  He allegedly re-injured his back on June 15, 2001.  The Plaintiff alleges that ""several hours after notifying his employer of re-injuring his back, Plaintiff was summarily terminated by Defendant.""  The ""Plaintiff alleges that a significant part of Defendant's decision to terminate him was because of his injury and because he exercised his rights under the Workers Compensation Act.""  The Petition goes on to state that the Defendant's actions ""were done in reckless disregard for the rights of the Plaintiff and/or were wanton and motivated by oppression, fraud and/or malice"" and thus includes a count for punitive damages.  Suit is filed in Tulsa County, State of Oklahoma, with an Answer date of before September 4, 2001.

Our preliminary review of the Petition, absent any independent investigation or knowledge with respect to the allegations and the value placed on same, suggests there might be coverage for this loss under the Directors & Officers policy.  The definition of ""WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE"" includes ""the actual or constructive termination of a career opportunity, or employment discipline or evaluation in a manner which violates any local, state, or federal law, whether existing by statute or common law, or which breaches any implied contract to continue employment""...It is doubtful this matter would exceed the $1M policy deductible.

Please advise if you would like for us to extent coverage to Nepco.  According to the information provided, the matter has been assigned to Bonnie White of the Litigation Unit and is being overseen by Richard Sanders of ENA.
