Message Date:  11/14/2001

Message Text:  High Inventory System Wide Operational Flow Order (SWOFO)


      OFO Stage :                        2
      Inventory Level :                 High
      Noncompliance Charge :    $1.00/Dth

PG&E's CGT has called a High Inventory System Wide OFO for flow day 11/15/2001.

High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily
usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.


Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.

Latest NFL Player News

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the te! am! 's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks' numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn't reliable enough to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.! sp! ortsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and two touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexan! de! r <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187382&> , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he's a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.




Quincy Carter! , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any league.  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235201&>Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/16/01
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. ""It's a small scope, not a big deal at all,"" Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. ""Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know."" Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive. 

Lamar Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 12/16/01
Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB has been very inc! on! sistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a few TD runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Pinkston left Sunday's game against Washington in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury. He did not return to the contest, and finished with two catches for 77 yards and a score. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/16/01
Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Watters left Sunday's game against Dallas in the fourth quarter with an injured right ankle. He was replaced by Shaun Alexander.

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough ! pl! ayer to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
garcia left Sunday's game with sore ribs in the first half, then returned later. Tim Rattay played much of the second half in his place.

Scotty Anderson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235015&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Anderson caught one pass for 69 yards against Minnesota. He will catch an occasional long ball, but Anderson is not producing enough to be useful for most Fantasy teams right now. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
McMahon threw for 241 yards and rushed for 74 yards and a TD against Minnesota. He will be a sevicable backup during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 12/16/01
The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any week of the Fantasy playoffs. 

M! ichael Bennett <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Bennett rushed for only 40 yards on 10 carries at Detroit. The rookie back is too inconsistent to rely on during the Fantasy postseason. 

Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Price caught four passes for 67 yards against New England. He appears to be Buffalo's most reliable Fantasy player at this time. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
The Patriots limited Van Pelt to 219 passing yards, no TDs and one interception. Right now, the Buffalo QB is not playing well enough to start for any Fantasy team. 

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 12/16/01
The Bills held Glenn to 27 yards on three catches. Glenn has missed too much time this year to regularly post good numbers for New England. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 12/16/01
Brady had another disappointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to! b! e a Fantasy risk during the most important weeks of the year.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Rhodes rushed for 177 yards and two TDs against Atlanta. The Colts are out of the playoff hunt, yet Rhodes will keep many Fantasy teams in the running for a title. 

Peyton Manning <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 12/16/01
Manning got back on track with 325 passing yards, three TDs and an interception against the Colts. He remains a must-start player in all Fantasy leagues.

Derrick Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander had four catches for 72 yards and a touchdown against Denver. He's been playing better in recent weeks, but Alexander is still a risky play outside of deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=253&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Martin caught seven passes for 84 yards and a TD at Indianapolis. Don't expect consistently good numbers from him during the Fantasy postseason.

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Christian, who is dealing with an elbow injury, practiced with the team on Wednesday. He's listed as probable for Sunday's game against Indianapolis, but he's a risky play for Fantasy owners. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/13/01
Smith underwent an MRI on his ailing knee this week, which revealed some cartilage damage. He practiced on Wednesday, however, and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against In! di! anapolis. He'll likely split carries with both Rodney Thomas and Bob Christian, so starting Smith is a real gamble. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/13/01
Davis missed practice on Wednesday due to a case of the flu. However, the big tailback is expected to return to practice this week and will start in Sunday's game against Philadelphia. 

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , Finneran could emerge as a starter in the next few weeks. Finneran has impressed Head Coach Dan Reeves, who has rewarded the receiver with more looks in the offense recently. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/13/01
According to the New York Post, Jurevicius will likely miss Saturday's game against Arizona. Jurevicius did not practice on Wednesday, and hasn't seen much improvement in his injured hamstring. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Morgan missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questi! on! able for Sunday's game. He is recovering from a shoulder injury. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Shea missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a shoulder injury and will be re-evaluated on a daily basis. 

Shannon Sharpe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Drew Brees <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=235197&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Mike Riley has now altered his stance on using Brees anytime soon. ""For the sake of this team, for what we've tried to accomplish and what we're still trying to accomplish this year, I want to show them in every way that we're trying to win,"" Riley said. ""I think Doug is our best chance to win. There are arguments to (play Brees), for sure. But I think you just get into a whole lot of stuff."" 

Keith Poole <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Poole's bruised ribs have! i! mproved, and he is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He is expected to start against the Chiefs.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/13/01
Smith missed practice on Wednesday because of his two sprained ankles. He will be a gametime decision again this week.

Roland Williams <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12829&>, TE OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Williams is day to day with knee and ankle injuries. He is expected to play on Saturday.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random! =4! 599&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Minnis is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to start on Sunday.

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/13/01
Griese (concussion) was held out of practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game with the Chiefs. If Griese practices on Friday, he may be able to play. If Griese can't play, Gus Frerotte will start in his place.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
! Smith might start at QB Sunday, replacing the injured Jon Kitna. Coach Dick LeBeau will wait until Friday to make a decision, but he assumed that Kitna's sprained middle finger on his passing hand won't improve enough to let him play against the New York Jets. Avoid using Smith. He is an erratic passer and is too risky a selection at this point in the season. 

Rob Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 12/13/01
The Buffalo News says there is a possibility Johnson might return for the season's final game. ""The healing has gone very well,"" Gregg Williams said. ""He's probably got another couple of weeks of the bone healing. We hope that he'll be able to get back into the practice situation within a couple of weeks and start to work on the field and be able to do some non-contact things. We'll continue to evaluate how it moves from that point forward."" 

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Kitna couldn't make a fist or throw a football Wednesday, so the Cincinnati Bengals are getting Akili Smith ready to start at quarterback for the first time this season. Coach Dick LeBeau will wait until Friday to make a decision, but he assumed that Kitna's sprained middle finger on h! is! passing hand won't improve enough to let him play against the New York Jets. Avoid using Kitna. He didn't play well when he has been healthy. 

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Rhodes is day to day with back and wrist injuries. He is expected to play on Sunday.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Wilkins missed Thursday's practice with a hamstring injury. He is not expected to play on Sunday.

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/13/01
Brunell did not practice Wednesday but will play Sunday, according to the Florida Times-Union. He is expected to practice on Thursday. Brunell is recovering from a lingering quadriceps injury and an injured finger.

Peter Warrick <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 12/13/01
Warrick missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a hip injury. 

Curtis Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.! 2&! random=4599&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 12/13/01
Martin was rested by Herman Edwards on Wednesday. ""His whole body hurts,"" Edwards told the New York Post. Martin is expected to start on Sunday.

Richie Anderson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1141&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Anderson is day to day to with a wrist injury. He is expected to play on Sunday.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
Seattle coach Mike Holmgren has confirmed he will start Watters over Shaun Alexander this week against Dallas. The move makes things very difficult for Fantasy owners who have depended on Alexander for most of the season. If Watters becomes the featured back once again, which has been suggested, Alexander may be rendered virtually worthless to Fantasy owners. 

Shaun Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/12/01
Now that Ricky Watters has been named the starting tailback in Seattle, Alexander's role in the offense will likely be diminished. As a result, starting Alexander on your Fantasy team becomes a serious gamble during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Steve Christie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1378&>, K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
Christie will continue to work on field goals. Both he and Wade Richey, who is working on kickoffs, are not reliable Fantasy kickers.

Drew Brees <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=235197&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Mike Riley has left the door open for Brees to possibly play in San Diego's final three games. ""There's no denying that the question will come up about Drew and we just haven't gone through it. I don't have to make that decision on this Monday, so I haven't really decided how to do that yet."" Brees lacks the experience to be a useful player during the Fantasy playoffs. ! 

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/12/01
Ward is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable because of a thigh injury. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/12/01
Bettis expects to play Sunday, despite being listed as questionable for Sunday's game. ""I plan to play,"" Bettis told The Baltimore Sun. When the paper asked how he could be so certain, Bettis said, ""Because I'm going to play. That's very clear."" 

Marco Battaglia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=146! 96! .2&random=4599&key=1324&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
Battaglia was claimed off waivers by the Washington Redskins on Tuesday. The former Cincinnati Bengal will replace the injured Stephen Alexander as the team's third tight end.

Frank Player News

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 12/13/01
Smith underwent an MRI on his ailing knee this week, which revealed some cartilage damage. He practiced on Wednesday, however, and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. He'll likely split carries with both Rodney Thomas and Bob Christian, so starting Smith is a real gamble. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Smith caught nine passes for 119 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. The veteran continues to be a reliable Fantasy player, and is a must-start every week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsistency, but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
Dillon had 86 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Jacksonville. His rushing totals have been down in recent weeks, but Dillon's potential to post solid Fantasy numbers in any given week is hard to ignore. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/09/01
Thrash caught five passes for 74 yards against San Diego. Thrash has not been a dependable receiver in recent weeks, and he may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 12/07/01
Plummer is playing better of late, but his production hasn't been worthy of starting consideration on your Fantasy team. He's a backup at best, and his poor history vs. Washington is enough to avoid using him in Week 13. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 12/07/01
Favre had a solid game against Jacksonville on Monday night, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. He'll have some success in Week 13 against Chicago, whose pass defense is ranked 30th in the league this season. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 12/07/01
Hearst (foot) practiced without incident on Thursday, and will start on Sunday against San Francisco. He's been one of the hottest tailbacks in the league in recent weeks, so be sure to put him into your starting lineup. 

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Mathis continues to do nothing this season for Fantasy owners. Unless you're in a deeper league, holding onto the veteran wide receiver isn't advisable. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 12/07/01
Schroeder had a solid game vs. Jacksonville on Monday night, and seems to be out of Brett Favre's doghouse. He's a must-start against Chicago, whose secondary is questionable at best. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Rob Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Moore was placed on injured reserve by the Arizona Cardinals this weekend, effectively ending his season. Moore, who hasn't played a game this year due to a hamstring injury, could be coming to the end of his career. 

James Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Allen will be the likely starter on Sunday against Detroit. Rookie Anthony Thomas is listed as a gametime decision due to a hamstring injury, but you'd have to bel! ie! ve that coach Dick Jauron wants to get him has healthy as possible for the team's upcoming playoff run. If Allen does in fact start, he's a good play for Fantasy owners in Week 12 against a weak Detroit defense. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Thomas (hamstring) missed practice on Friday and is listed as a gametime decision against Detroit. Considering that Chicago is in the playoff hunt and is playing a team that's 0-10, don't be surprised if coach Dick Jauron gives Thomas another week off in order to get healthy. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/01/01
Thomas missed Friday's practice due to a strained hamstring, and remains a gametime decision. James Allen would get the start in his place, and we recommend you wait until a final decision is reached before you opt to use either back this week.

Raghib Ismail <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Ismail is expected to play Sunday against Washington despite a concussion he suffered this week. He's still not a recommended starter this week.

Tai Streets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133425&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Stree! ts! was added to the injury report as probable for Sunday's game against Buffalo due to a minor hamstring injury. He would likely start in place of Terrell Owens if the latter is unable to play. Streets is a marginal starter to begin with, and only if Owens is clearly not going to play.

Jimmy Kleinsasser <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133340&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Kleinsasser will not play Sunday against Pittsburgh and could miss a few more games due to a high ankle sprain, according to published reports. He isn't much of a Fantasy factor to begin with, so this news probably doesn't affect your lineup decisions this week.

Daunte ! Cu! lpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133263&> , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/01/01
According to published reports, Culpepper practiced on Friday despite a knee injury. He is expected to start Sunday's game against Pittsburgh, but will be only about 70 percent healthy and will have severely limited mobility in the game. Culpepper is a very risky start this week, so don't use him unless you don't have a viable alternative.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Cleeland practiced with the scout team on Friday despite an ankle injury, according to published reports. However, he is not expected to play Sunday, so expect Boo Williams to start at tight end once again. Use Williams and not Cleeland this week.
Frank Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
Sanders will travel with the Cardinals for Sunday's game against Oakland despite a hamstring, according to published reports. However, he is a gametime decision, so hold off on using him this week.

David Sloan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 12/01/01
According to published reports, Sloan said Friday that he has a slight tear of the medial collateral ligament in his knee. He has not been able to practice all week and most likely will not play Sunday against Chicago. Keep Sloan on your bench this week.! 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/01/01
Owens was able to practice Friday for the first time this week due to foot and ankle sprains, according to the Contra Costa Times. He will be re-evaluated Saturday to see if he has any lingering stiffness, and remains questionable for Sunday's game against Buffalo. If Owens does not play, he would only miss one week, according to Head Coach Steve Mariucci. Unless it becomes clear he will play before you need to make a lineup decision, you should probably reserve him for this week.

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/01/01
Barlow missed Friday's practice due to a shoulder injury, according to the Contra Costa Times. He is unlikely to play Sunday against Buffalo, and you shouldn't use him this week as a result.

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Dyson is recovering from a toe injury, but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as questionable. Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. The injury will likely slow him down a bit. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Even though George's stats have been on the decline it will be hard to find a better running back on waivers. George has struggled recently but is still a must-start every week. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/30/01
Wycheck, still suffering from an ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Ward doesn't score often, but has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year. He will always pos! t ! respectable totals so keep him in your lineup every week. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect him to be too productive. Check and see if there is a more productive tight end on the waiver wires before settling on him. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 11/30/01
Despite his recent troubles off the field, Smith is still one of the best receivers. Look for him to catch some passes this week and be a solid No. 2 wideout. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Couch has been solid this season despite the lack of a solid No. 2 wideout. He will be a good pickup if you are looking for starting QB. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Morgan might regain his starting job this week, but don't expect him to be too productive. He has only caught 22 passes this season, two of which are TDs. 

Darnay Scott!  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Don't expect Scott to be too productive this week. He only has two TD catches this season. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Expect Grbac to have a solid game this week against the Colts. Indianapolis has allowed 17 TD passes this season. 

Travis Taylor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187399&>, WR BAL - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Taylor has been unproductive this season. However, he could experience some success this week against a shaky Colts defense. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Hasselbeck has been playing well in recent weeks, but he isn't putting up great Fantasy numbers. He is looked upon to avoid mistakes, not to win games for Seattle. As a result, Hasselbeck isn't worth more than a reserve role on your Fantasy team. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/30/01
Jackson has been playing well in recent weeks, and he should have another good week against San Diego. The Chargers pass defense has been in question in recent weeks, so starting Jackson in deeper leagues is ! ad! visable. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Garner is a must-start against Arizona in Week 12. He faces a great matchup against the Cardinals, who have one of the worst defenses in the entire league. 

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/30/01
Rice still has plenty of life in his 39 year old legs, and he'll prove it on Sunday against Arizona. The Cards are one of the worst teams in the league against the pass, so starting Rice in Week 12 is advisable. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brown should have a field day against Arizona on Sunday. The Cardinals secondary is very vulnerable to solid passing teams, so look for the veteran wideout to have a big day. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1577&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, so starting him in Week 12 is a wise move.

Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1663&> , RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12207&>, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1034&> , QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2640&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Barlow is not a good start in Week 14. He won't do much against a tough Miami defense that will surely limit his red zone production. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Hearst may not post good rushing numbers against the Dolphins. But the 49ers have often featured him as a receiver to keep defenses off balance, and may use him often as a passing target in Week 14.

Boo Williams <http://football29! 9.! fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=237007&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Williams is now the starter at TE for New Orleans. He will get regular red-zone looks from Aaron Brooks and may catch a few important TD passes during the Fantasy postseason.

Willie Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 12/14/01
Jackson is an inconsistent Fantasy wideout. But there is no way you should bench a player of his caliber during the Fantasy postseason.

Aaron Brooks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=133233&> , QB NO - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Brooks is a boom-or-bust Fantasy selection in Week 14. If the Rams blitz him often, he may struggle, but he may also trade TDs with Kurt Warner. There is no way, however, you can bench him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Torry Holt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 12/14/01
The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularly featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Faulk will have another fine game this week. He is a great start on Monday Night Football against New Orleans. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success this week. Expect fine numbers from him against the NFC West rival Saints on Monday Night Football. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Moore hasn't been a quality Fantasy player this year. Look for other options if you need TE help during the Fantasy postseason.

Jacquez Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Green hasn't been a good Fantasy player this season. Don't use him during your playoffs. Keyshawn Johnson is Tampa Bay's only productive wideout. 

Brad Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Johnson has been a mediocre Fantasy QB this year. He may struggle at Chicago this week. Other than Keyshawn Johnson, he doesn't have the weapons necessary to challenge the Bears' secondary. 

David Terrell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ran! do! m=3415&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Terrell has disappeared from a statistical perspective. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
White hasn't been much of a Fantasy receiver this year. He is not worth starting during the Fantasy playoffs because of his lack of his regular production. 

Jim Miller <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1053&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Miller will struggle against the Buccaneers this week. He may throw more than one interception against Tampa Bay. 

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Franks may be good for a TD catch this week. Green Bay should move the ball rather easily at Tennessee.

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Schroeder should post good yardage numbers at Tennessee. The Titans' cornerbacks may have trouble with his speed on post and fly routes. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scri! pt! =players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Favre should toss at least two TD passes this week. He will certainly exploit every weakness in the vulnerable Tennessee pass defense. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Morton should reach the 100-yard receiving mark this week. The Minnesota secondary won't be able to handle the veteran receiver, especially on slant and post routes. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01 If you desperate for QB help, consider McMahon this week. He may fare well against the awful Minnesota defense.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Chamberlain has been unreliable recently. Still, he is worth starting because the Vikings will face the inconsistent Detroit defense this week. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Carter should post respectable, if not spectacular numbers this week. He will find the Detroit secondary very easy to work against.

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Moss is an excellent start in Week 14. He should catch at least one TD pass against the Lions.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Bouman is expected to start again in place of the injured Daunte Culpepper this week. He should find the end zone at least twice against the hapless Lions. 

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Gardner has been a servicable Fantasy player this year, but don't count on him to find the end zone against the tough Philadelphia secondary this week. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Westbrook will face a very tough matchup in Week 14. Don't expect him to break loose from Philadelphia CB Bobby Taylor very often.

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Don't start Banks in Week 14. He will struggle against the Philadelphia secondary,! a! nd he may take several coverage sacks and big hits. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard this week. The Giants should be able to exploit the holes in Arizona's secondary with regular strikes to Hilliard and Amani Toomer.

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Tommer is a good start in Week 14. He will regularly challenge the Arizona secondary with his quickness and separation speed. 

Frank Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Sanders hasn't been a much of a factor in the Arizona offense this year. Avoid using him during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3415&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Plummer may struggle on the road this week. The Giants may dominate a home matchup with the Cardinals.

Plan for the Playoffs 

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.

If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup. 

  _____  

Game-by-Game Analysis 

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Mike Blake 

I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten? 

Answer - GG 

Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad. 


Question - Russell Brown 

My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie. 

Answer - GG 

Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 


Question - Chris Gilcrest 

Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, Curtis Martin? 

Answer - GG 

Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit is too good to ignore. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Dyson is recovering from a toe injury, but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as questionable. Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. The injury will likely slow him down a bit. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Even though George's stats have been on the decline it will be hard to find a better running back on waivers. George has struggled recently but is still a must-start every week. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/30/01
Wycheck, still suffering from an ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/30/01
Ward doesn't score often, but has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year. He will always post respectable totals so keep him in your lineup every week. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect him to be too productive. Check and see if there is a more productive tight end on the waiver wires before settling on him. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 11/30/01
Despite his recent troubles off the field, Smith is still one of the best receivers. Look for him to catch some passes this week and be a solid No. 2 wideout. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=4576&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Couch has been solid this season despite the lack of a solid No. 2 wideout. He will be a good pickup if you are looking for starting QB. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Morgan might regain his starting job this week, but don't expect him to be too productive. He has only caught 22 passes this season, two of which are TDs. 

Darnay Scott <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Don't expect Scott to be too productive this week. He only has two TD catches this season. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Expect Grbac to have a solid game this week against the Colts. Indianapolis has allowed 17 TD passes this season. 

Travis Taylor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187399&>, WR BAL - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Taylor has been unproductive this season. However, he could experience some success this week against a shaky Colts defense. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige! 01! &owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/30/01
Hasselbeck has been playing well in recent weeks, but he isn't putting up great Fantasy numbers. He is looked upon to avoid mistakes, not to win games for Seattle. As a result, Hasselbeck isn't worth more than a reserve role on your Fantasy team. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/30/01
Jackson has been playing well in recent weeks, and he should have another good week against San Diego. The Chargers pass defense has been in question in recent weeks, so starting Jackson in deeper leagues is advisable. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Garner is a must-start against Arizona in Week 12. He faces a great matchup against the Cardinals, who have one of the worst defenses in the entire league. 

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/30/01
Rice still has plenty of life in his 39 year old legs, and he'll prove it on Sunday against Arizona. The Cards are one of the worst teams in the league against the pass, so starting Rice in Week 12 is advisable. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=playe! rs! &league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brown should have a field day against Arizona on Sunday. The Cardinals secondary is very vulnerable to solid passing teams, so look for the veteran wideout to have a big day. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/30/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, so starting him in Week 12 is a wise move. 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull! Updated 11/30/01
Brown has been one of the most reliable Fantasy players in the league this season. He had five catches for 82 yards in his first meeting of the year against the Jets, and is a solid play for Fantasy owners this week. 

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Patten's numbers have been down somewhat in recent weeks. He's still worth Fantasy consideration in Week 12, however, but only in deeper leagues. 

Curtis Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 11/30/01
The Jets offe! ns! e will continue to be the ""Curtis Martin Show"" in Week 12. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy players in the league, and is far too valuable to ever bench. 

Vinny Testaverde <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 11/30/01
Due to the new conservative offense in New York, Testaverde isn't the reliable Fantasy player he once was. He's not even worth a roster spot in some leagues, and is no better than a reserve in others. 

Anthony Becht <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Becht has been very unreliable this season as a Fantasy player. Unless you're desperate for a tight end in Week 12, benching Becht is advisable. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Coles is New York's best receiving threat, which makes him worthy of Fantasy consideration in any week. He'll face a decent New England secondary in Week 12, but starting him is still a good option, especially in deeper leagues. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Chambers had a huge against Buffalo last week catching f! iv! e passes for 101 yards and two touchdowns. He's the best rookie wideout in the NFL, and is worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
McKnight could find some success downfield against a questionable Denver secondary in Week 12. However, he's only worth taking a chance on in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 11/30/01
Harrison had a huge game against San Francisco in Week 11, catching eight passes for 128 yards and a touchdown. He may have a tough time putting up those kind of numbers against Baltimore, but he's still a must-start for Fantasy owners. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Pollard has become one of Peyton Manning's favorite targets this season. He's may not be the most consistent tight end in the league, but his potential to score touchdowns makes him worth starting every week. 

Ken Dilger <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Dilger has been a major disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. With Marcus Pollard emerging as the Colts primary tight end, Dilger has very little Fantasy value. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Wilkins will likely start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne in Week 12. Playing against a tough Baltimore defense isn't to his advantage, however, so starting Wilkins is a gamble. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4576&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Alexander caught only four passes for 39 yards, but he did score his second touchdown of the season. However, he's still too unreliable to start every week.

Player Updates NFL Reports  	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News 

Terrell Davis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/24/01 
Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=12306&>, WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Giggles Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. 

Lamar Smith  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. 

Jerome Pathon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01 
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Brett Favre  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.

Isaac Bruce  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 10/22/01 
Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints. 

Maurice Smith  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=188183&>, Active RB Updated 10/22/01 
Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again until November 4. 

Bill Schroeder  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1593&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/21/01 
Schroeder will be inactive for Sunday's game at Minnesota. Corey Bradford is expected to start in his place.

Corey Dillon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 10/21/01 
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

Jake Plummer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/18/01 
Plummer has put up decent numbers over the first five weeks of the season, but he's still throwing far too many interceptions. Kansas City has a solid pass defense, so try to avoid using Plummer if at all possible. 

James Thrash  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1859&>, Active WR Updated 10/18/01 
Thrash has been somewhat of a bust thus far, and isn't worth starting on a consistent basis Fantasy-wise. As a result, don't play the Eagles' wideout unless he proves that he can be more reliable. 

Terance Mathis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01 
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 

Jimmy Smith  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01 
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Dorsey Levens  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01 
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Garrison Hearst  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1164&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01 
Hearst has been relatively productive over the past two weeks, but is only worth starting in larger leagues. He'll continue to split time with rookie Kevan Barlow, so it's tough to recommend starting him on a weekly basis.

Olandis Gary  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/07/01 
Gary carried the ball only nine times for 28 yards in Denver's 20-6 win over Kansas City. He may have slipped to No. 2 on the depth chart behind Mike Anderson. 

Titans  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 10/07/01 
Defensive back Samari Rolle has been taken off the field on a stretcher in the first half of Sunday's game against Baltimore. He is not expected to return to the game. 

David Akers  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2616&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00 
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

with primary corridor rights that encompass and extend beyond the 
Sand Springs to Ignacio Bondad (or LaPlata-TW) corridor. 

5) Available for TF-1 or TF-2 transportation service.  TF-2 service 
will not be discounted below Northwest's current Tariff filed rate 
for TF-2 service.  Additionally, TF2 service must be linked to

Latest NFL Player News

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/29/01
Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start. If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start. 

Larry Foster <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1186&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/29/01
Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Spergon Wynn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=187690&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. 

Drew Bledsoe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/28/01
A banged-up Smith Toe/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback. 

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1077&> , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/28/01
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day."" 

Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1393&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.

"RE: Western Frontier update","I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Subject:	Western Frontier Project

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 12/27/01

Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/27/01
The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133462&> , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01

The Miami Herald reports Minor will get more work on offense this week. Lamar Smith will remain the starter, but the Dolphins are hoping Minor can inject some life into the offense. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/27/01
The Detroit Free Press says Stewart is not expected to play this week because of a sprained ankle. Lamont Warren and Cory Schlesinger will assume most of the workload in his place. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
The Detroit Free Press says McMahon is not expected to practice or play this week. Ty Detmer will start in his place. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Griese told the Denver Post he is ready to take on the Broncos, although Mike Shanahan questioned how effective he would be in his return. ""How do you know with a concussion?"" Shanahan said. ""There should be no side effects. Hopefully there's not. But we have learned a lot through the years about concussions and how serious the! y ! can be, and hopefully that's something in the past and they won't reoccur."" 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01

Smith underwent surgery on his left hamstring. He is expected to be ready for training camp next season and will compete for the starting job. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Walls is listed as questionable with a knee injury. He was expected to be evaluated again on Thursday. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/27/01
Muhammad (turf toe) is not expected to play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/27/01
Henry will sit out again this week with a sprained knee. Shawn Bryson will start for the second consecutive week.

McNair missed practice Wednesday because of back pain. ""I'm going to try to do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not have as much pain as I had today,"" McNair said. ""I'm not going to go out and try to force the issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue."" The Titans listed him as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/27/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice, and indicated he might not play in the regular season's final two games. ""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing, that means not playing,"" Bettis told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""But you want to make sure you're healed up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely."" 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the Baltimore Ravens this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play. Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday. ""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/26/01
Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear.

Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12436&> , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Peter Warrick <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 12/26/01
Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.

Subject:	RE: ABC Shrinkage Commitments

As of November 1/01, the volumes that we can pull back at Kingsgate without incurring an SDD day have changed.


Implications for Trading

Approximately 15,000 mmbtu can be safely pulled back from Kingsgate without incurring a SDD day (as opposed to 9000 mmbtu)
Approximately 79,000 mmbtu can be pulled back from Kingsgate without pulling back Chevron/Talisman/Devon from ABC (as opposed to 69,000mmbtu).
Pulling back Chevron, Devon and/or Talisman requires their prior consent and Eric Ledain must first be consulted.
Triggering Event absolutely must not be incurred unless specifically directed by Eric or above.


If you have any questions, please let me know,

Subject:	ABC Shrinkage Commitments

Given the experience we had pulling back our West Gate sales this past weekend and the ongoing opportunity for pull back this summer, we should reaquaint ourselves with Enron Canada's Malin deals and shrinkage obligations with the Cochrane extraction plant now owned by Williams.

ECC has longterm Kingsgate sales to ENA of 87,500 mmbtu plus fuel.
Supply is from a producer pool at NIT of 67,500 mmbtu plus fuel  and at ABC of 20,000 mmbtu plus fuel (from Talisman for 10,000 mmbtu plus fuel and from Chevron for 10,000 mmbtu plus fuel on a NIT for ABC buy/sell).
ECC has a firm longterm commitment to supply the Cochrane plant with 59,000 mcf each day subject to exceptions for force majeure and allowable ""Supplier Deficiency Default"" days.  ECC is paid $0.005/mcf.  Any shrinkage above this level is interruptible.
In any rolling one-year period ECC is allowed 80 SDD days but has to pay a penalty for deficient volumes.  Penalty scale is as follows:
Days	Deficiency Penalty
0-30	$.0075/mcf
31-40	$.01/mcf
41-50	$.015/mcf
51-60	$.028/mcf
61-70	$.033/mcf
71-80	$.037/mcf
>80	Triggering Event (i.e. allows the contract to be terminated or renegotiated)

As of June1, 2001 there were zero SDD days used up.
Talisman and Chevron have shrinkage arrangement that have to be respected.  Their volumes are ranked first through the ABC meter ahead of ECC's.
 A Force Majeure event with proper notification does not constitute a SDD day.

Implications for Trading

Approximately 9,000 mmbtu can be safely pulled back from Kingsgate without incurring a SDD day.
Approximately 69,000 mmbtu can be pulled back from Kingsgate without pulling back Chevron/Talisman from ABC.
Pulling back Chevron and/or Talisman requires their prior consent and Eric Ledain must first be consulted.
Triggering Event absolutely must not be incurred unless specifically directed by Eric or above.

Stacey/Andrea: It is extremely important that and accurate and up to date SDD count is maintained in our ANG point balance and verified against the monthly statement from the plant that Accounting receives.  Myself, Peggy and Trading should be regularly made aware of what the count is especially at the begining of each month and when we approach a new penalty tier.

Any questions or clarifiacations let me know.

Kevin

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Tavis Butler, Richmond, VA 

I have Keyshawn Johnson, Kevin Johnson, Jerry Rice and Jimmy Smith. Which three of these WRs should I start in Week 13? 

Answer - GG 

Keyshawn leads the league in receptions (83), but still has no touchdowns. He's a risky start in TD-based leagues, but he's facing a subpar Detroit secondary and has a great chance to score his first TD this week. Kevin Johnson has been solid, and Smith is too good to bench. The odd man out here is Rice, who has played very well but is not as consistent. 


Question - Lou Spadone, New York City 

Which two of these RBs should I start: Antowain Smith, Dominic Rhodes, Charlie Garner, Larry Centers? Also, will Rod Smith play well against Seattle? If he doesn't play, would you start J.J. Stokes or Joey Galloway? 

Answer - GG 

Centers is definitely not an option. Smith has become a solid Fantasy player this season, so we'd start him. Garner has a good matchup vs. Kansas City, but we'd side with Rhodes over him. Rhodes will get every opportunity to produce, while Garner loses red zone carries to Zack Crockett. As for your second question, Smith is still hampered by ankle injuries, which makes him a risk. If he's not able to play, we'd go with Stokes, who has put up decent numbers in recent weeks. 


Question - Eric Mitchell, Durham, NC 

Who would you start this week: Corey Dillon or Duce Staley? 

Answer - GG 

Dillon hasn't rushed for over 100 yards since week seven, in large part because Cincinnati's passing game is sputtering. Staley and the Eagles offense looked sharp in Philly's win over Kansas City last week. They are using Staley effectively on offense, so start him over Dillon. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Marc Sturgis, Plano, TX: Many football experts think that Emmitt Smith is all washed up, but he proved on Sunday that as long as he gets carries, he'll be productive. If he continues to get 25 carries per game, Emmitt will be a useful Fantasy player the rest of the season.

You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Aaron Giersdorf, Mankato, MN 

Should I take a chance and bench Emmitt Smith and/or Keyshawn Johnson? I need to start two running backs among Emmitt, Tyrone Wheatley, Zack Crockett and Mike Alstott; and two receivers among Keyshawn, Chris Chambers, Qadry Ismail and Antonio Freeman. 

Answer - GG 

There's no doubt that you should start both Smith and Johnson. Both players have produced solid numbers in recent weeks, and will be prominent parts of their respective offenses in the weeks to come. Wheatley and Crockett are far too risky to start at this stage of the Fantasy season, so we'd advise going with Alstott, who has seen his role in Tampa Bay's offense increase over the past few weeks. Go with Freeman at WR; he's facing a shaky Titans secondary. 


Question - Kenik Hassel, Seattle, WA 

Which quarterback should I start this week: Daunte Culpepper or Steve McNair? 

Answer - GG 

Culpepper is expected to start against Detroit in week 14, but you never know what will happen with Dennis Green calling the shots. Reports last Sunday stated that Culpepper would start vs. Tennessee, but then Green decided to play Todd Bouman at the last second. We like the matchup against a porous Lions unit, but if there's any question at all about Culpepper's status, we'd side with McNair, who has been one of the best quarterbacks in Fantasy Football over the past six weeks. 


Question - David Sant, Cincinnati, OH 

Who should I start as my second RB alongside Marshall Faulk: Shaun Alexander or Lamar Smith? 

Answer - GG 

Now that Ricky Watters has been named the starting running back in Seattle, Alexander is a gamble. He'll likely get a few carries in the game, but whether or not he gets enough looks to be productive is uncertain. As a result, we suggest either signing Watters off waivers (if available), or simply going with Smith against San Francisco. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Michael Phillips, Fort Lauderdale, FL: Is there any question that Jay Fiedler is a good Fantasy quarterback? He's put up nine touchdowns in his last three games, including four against Indianapolis on Monday night. Unless you have a QB like Kurt Warner, Jeff Garcia or Donovan McNabb, starting Fiedler should always be a consideration.

"P&L estimates","Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Kyle Buhler 

My three running backs are: Corey Dillon, Warrick Dunn and Garrison Hearst. Which two should I start in week nine? 

Answer - GG 

Dillon is far too valuable to bench. That leaves Dunn and Hearst, and neither has been very reliable for Fantasy owners. We'd recommend Dunn based on the matchup. Hearst is facing a tough New Orleans defense that gave up only 66 yards rushing to Curtis Martin a week ago, while Dunn faces a Detroit unit that is allowing an astounding 146.9 rushing yards per game. 


Question - Charlie Oddo 

Who should I start this week: Charlie Batch or Brian Griese? 

Answer - GG 

Batch had three straight solid games before stumbling badly this past weekend against San Francisco, and facing Tampa Bay doesn't bode well for his chances in week nine. He may also lose snaps to rookie Mike McMahon over the next few weeks, which is even more reason to avoid him. Griese hasn't been great, but he's still averaging close to two touchdown passes per game and is facing a San Diego secondary that has been very mediocre lately. The choice here is Griese, who is a much more reliable Fantasy QB than Batch, despite the fact that he's thrown nine interceptions in his last four games. 


Question - Matt MacLachlan 

I need to pick one starter for a ""flex"" position (meaning any player on my roster can be used at this position.) Should I start Kevan Barlow, Kevin Johnson or Peerless Price? 

Answer - GG 

Barlow isn't getting enough carries (8.7 per game) to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this time. Price has been unreliable for the most part, and facing a good New England secondary won't help his chances this week. Johnson has been the most consistent player of the three, especially over his last four games. Johnson has averaged 84.2 yards receiving and has four touchdowns over that span, and seems to be your best option. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Pete Richards, Reading, PA: After a disappointing rookie campaign, Plaxico Burress is finally showing flashes of the talent he displayed at Michigan State. The emergence of Burress not only raises his own value as a Fantasy player, but it raises the stock of Jerome Bettis, Hines Ward and Kordell Stewart as well. Outside of Bettis, it's quite possible that Burress, Ward and Stewart are still available in many Fantasy leagues, and I feel that all three would make great midseason acquisitions.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 12/06/01
Tomlinson will face the usually tough Philadelphia defense in Week 13. Still, he is a must-start player because of his regular touches and TD production, 

Dwayne Carswell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1328&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Carswell has become a top target for the injury-riddled Broncos. He is definitely worth starting as Denver plays an important AFC West game against Seattle. 

Koren Robinson <http://football299.fant! as! y.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235239&>, WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Robinson has done little to impress Fantasy players in his rookie year. Don't use him unless your team is ultra-thin at wide receiver.

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 12/06/01
Jackson is a solid start this week. The Seahawks are playing in a pivotal game at Denver, and Matt Hasselbeck will give his top receiver a lot of important looks.

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 12/06/01
Rice may be good for at least one TD catch this week. The Kansas City secondary may have trouble with the veteran receiver on slant and crossing patterns. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Garner should easily approach the 100-yard mark against the Chiefs. Kansas City's inconsistent front seven will have trouble with the slashing, speedy back. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Gonzalez hasn't performed up to expectations this year. St! il! l, he may be motivated to play well in AFC West game with the archrival Raiders.

Derrick Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 12/06/01
Alexander has been nearly useless as a Fantasy player this season. Don't expect him to do much at Oakland this week.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Holmes is a must-start player, and the Raiders have been vulnerable to the run in recent weeks. Expect another 100-yard game from Holmes this week.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/06/01
Don't start Green this week unless your Fantasy team is thin at QB. He may have a very forgettable day at Oakland. The Raiders will have something to prove after being upset by Arizona. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/06/01
Even against the weak Colts defense, Gadsden is a risky start. He has been a big disappointment this year, and he doesn't seem to fit in well with a Miami offense that now seems to stretch the field more often.

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.! co! m/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/06/01
The erratic Fiedler should be a good start this week. He should do reasonably well in a Monday Night game against an AFC East team with a weak defense (Indianapolis). 

Trevor Insley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=188095&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Insley (head) is listed as probable for Monday Night's game. He is not worth adding to a roster unless injuries continue to be a factor at the WR spot for Indianapolis.

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235256&> , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Wayne missed last week's game with a knee injury, but he is not listed on this week's injury report. He is still a risky start because of his inexperience.

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 12/06/01
Expect another big game from Harrison this week. He will definitely do well in the Monday Night spotlight against an AFC East foe.

Peyton Manning <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 12/06/01
Manning's performance at Miami may include h! er! oics and mistakes. He should be able to burn the Dolphins' defense for more than one TD, yet he may also make more than one turnover.

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/06/01
Smith is a must-start player at this point of the season. He is a regular TD threat no matter who he faces.

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 12/06/01
Brady could find TDs hard to come by in Week 13. The Browns' defense may be fired up to perform well after getting embarrassed by Tennessee last week.

Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Price's production has slowed a bit recently, but he should be a good start in Week 13. Carolina may have trouble handling the Buffalo passing game.

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Alexander continues to insist that he has a chance to play against the season, according to the Washington Post. He suffered a fractured bone in his lower leg against Dallas, and is out indefinitely at this point. Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister will split time at tight end in his absence. 

Eric Moulds <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 12/06/01
Moulds is definitely a solid start this week. The Bills should have a good offensive game against Carolina.

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/06/01
Henry may be good for a TD run this week. Buffalo should be able to get him some goal-line opportunities against Carolina.

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12! /0! 6/01
Hardy (knee) was placed on injured reserve Thursday by the Arizona Cardinals. The Arizona Republic reports that Tywan Mitchell will be the starting tight end in his absence. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Van Pelt should rebound from an off week against the 49ers. Expect him to throw at least two TD passes against the Panthers.

Anthony Becht <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
If you have another tight end available, sit Becht this week. He won't be open often ! ag! ainst the Pittsburgh defense.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/06/01
This will be another disappointing week for Chrebet. The Steelers will definitely limit his statistical output.

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/06/01
Jurevicius was forced to leave Wednesday's practice due to a hamstring injury. Despite the injury, Jurevicius is expected to play on Sunday against Dallas. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=13! 21! &>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/06/01
Walls is now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo. Walls, who injured his ankle during last week's game vs. New Orleans, is a risky Fantasy player in Week 13 unless his status is upgraded. 

Curtis Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 12/06/01
Martin will face a tough Pittsburgh defense this week, but there is no way you should reserve him. He has arguably been the most reliable RB in Fantasy Football this year.

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3127&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/0! 6/! 01
According to the Charlotte Observer, Muhammad is expected to start on Sunday against Buffalo. Muhammad, who has missed two games due to a shoulder injury, has returned to practice and looked as though he could return. ""There's always a possibility (he won't play), but the way he practiced I'd say so,"" coach George Seifert said. ""I guess I'd say cautiously optimistic."" Barring any setbacks with his health, starting Muhammad in deeper leagues is worth considering.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

Muhammad (toe) has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Isaac Byrd will start in his place.

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01
White has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. David Terrell is expected to start in his place. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/30/01

Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start. If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01

Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.

Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Spergon Wynn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187690&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. 

Drew Bledsoe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4502&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football222! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key! =1! 87503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01! 
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent! Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
! Te! rrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season g! am! e this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week ! Se! ven.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy t! ol! d the St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1886&key=1116&>, RB DET - ! H! unter Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'
-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/25/01
Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1069&> , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=12207&> , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1310&> , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2079&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Edgerrin James  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/26/01 
James sprained his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game. 

Derrick Alexander  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 10/25/01 
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.

Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.

Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/25/01 
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01

Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01

Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 10/25/01 
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills. 

Chad Morton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=187613&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01

Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy. 

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3675&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/25/01

Special Terms & Cond:   See 1, 2 and 3 Below. 




SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
entering into the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the capacity 
and shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's transmission system without impacting the discount for the 
original shipper. 

3. This prearranged offer is for a volumetric reservation contract demand. A 
monthly base reservation charge per unit of transportation contact demand 
shall be the awarded rate/dth multiplied by the dth's delivered during the 
month, divided by the total monthly Transportation contract Demand.  In 
addition to the Volumetric Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the 
volumetric charge, the applicable surcharges and fuel. 



PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of transportation 
capacity for electronic bid (""package or packages""): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of available 
transportation capacity.  Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple 
rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation 
capacity under the specified package.  If the same Shipper submits multiple bids, 
the highest present value for such package of available transportation capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.  If bid rate is 
        less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:  Bid Rate x 
        FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the 
        maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:  Bid Rate x FERC Interest 
        Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied shipper 
        will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid within 24 
        hours of the bid close time.  Such improved bid shall be faxed to (801) 584-7076 
        to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.  If a tie still exists, such capacity shall 
        be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer than 
        indicated for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

Statistics Changes 

Statistics for our Fantasy Football games are provided by the same service that keeps official stats for the NFL, and your league is scored according to these official stats. Occasionally we receive changes to the stats we initially post after the games on Sunday or Monday nights. This happens when a stat was incorrectly reported during a game. Please note that you will rarely, if ever, see these changes reflected in published box scores, whether on-line or in print. However, we include all stat changes that we receive by Tuesday at midnight ET each week.

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Jonathan Stark, St. Paul, Minnesota 

I have to bench either Tim Brown, Troy Brown, Marty Booker or Laveranues Coles. Who would you bench this week? 

Answer - GG 

Tim Brown always seems to save his best for AFC West matchups, and should have a big game against the Broncos. A Monday Night audience only adds to his motivation. Coles has become New York's No. 1 WR, and will be facing an erratic New Orleans secondary. The Jets may also have to play catch-up, and throw the ball at New Orleans. Troy Brown is facing one of the most porous secondaries in the NFC (Atlanta). We must recommend sitting Booker, who is facing the fundamentally superior Cleveland defense. 


Question - John Olsen, Rockaway, New Jersey 

This week I was able to pick up Dominic Rhodes, the backup to Edgerrin James. I also have Ahman Green vs. Tampa Bay and Anthony Thomas vs. Cleveland, along with Mike Alstott and Maurice Smith. Which two running backs should I start this week? 

Answer - GG 

Rhodes is still an unproven player, despite his excellent game against the Chiefs. Alstott has hurt the Packers before, and ran a decisive 37-yard TD in the teams' first meeting this year. The inconsistent Smith is a risky start against the Patriots. You simply have to go with your two best players here. Green is playing in a pivotal NFC Central matchup, and no one has been able to stop Thomas yet. 


Question - Jason Yearot, Williamsburg, Virginia 

Daunte Culpepper is off this week, and Vinny Testaverde is my backup. Should I use Vinny vs. New Orleans, or grab Rob Johnson off waivers? Also, would you start the Miami defense vs. Carolina or the Bears defense vs. Cleveland? 

Answer - GG 

Johnson showed a lot of grit in last week's game against the Chargers, and is facing a vulnerable Colts defense. But he is banged up, and Testaverde might test an inconsistent New Orleans secondary at times. Neither is a great start, but Testaverde is healthy, and Johnson could hurt your numbers if he takes another big hit and leaves the game. The Bears won't be tested by Cleveland's running game, but Tim Couch and Kevin Johnson may hurt them. Carolina doesn't have the running game or receiving talent (besides Muhsin Muhammad) to challenge the Dolphins, who are the better pick. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Shawn Abel, Midlothian, Virginia: It is time to stop recommending Fantasy teams bench their quarterback when facing the Baltimore Ravens. I benched Mark Brunell last week in favor of Vinny Testaverde and it cost me dearly. Brett Favre, Tim Couch and Brunell have proven the past three weeks that a quality quarterback can torch Baltimore's defense.

"NGI Article:  El Paso Seeks to Derail Further Market Power Investigation","Another wrinkle in the El Paso/CPUC Complaint case.  I've also attached a copy of the El Paso Merchant answer to the FERC enforcement staff motion in case you're interested.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 2, 2001
El Paso Seeks to Derail Further Market Power Investigation 
The motion by the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a ""more complete investigation"" of unused capacity on the system of El Paso Natural Gas is ""an abuse of process,"" the pipeline and its merchant energy affiliate claimed Thursday, since it comes after the case has been fully litigated. 
In filing a motion to strike the enforcement staff's request for the investigation, El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy said the staff motion is a violation of their due process rights, since an initial decision in the case was issued three weeks ago (see Daily GPI, Oct. 10 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011010c.html>). At that time Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. recommended the dismissal of charges that El Paso and its affiliate exercised market power to drive up prices for gas transported to the border beginning in mid-2000 [RP00-241]. The judge had concluded that the complainants in the case failed to carry their burden of proof that the El Paso companies exercised market power by withholding capacity from the market. 
After the parties file briefs on the ALJ's decision, all that remains is a vote by the commissioners, the El Paso companies pointed out. 
The investigation sought by the Market Oversight and Enforcement Section (MOE) of the Office of General Counsel ""seeks to improperly shift the burden of proof by requiring El Paso and Merchant Energy to prove that they did not withhold capacity. This argument turns the Commission's adjudicatory procedures -- and its procedural safeguards -- on their head,"" the companies said. 
""MOE is attempting to inappropriately influence the decision-making process in this already high profile case,"" putting the integrity of FERC's adjudicatory process in jeopardy. ""The rules under which the complaint is to be judged have become a moving target, El Paso's and Merchant Energy's due process rights and reputation have been harmed, and they have been put in the untenable position of now trying to prove a negative. MOE's improper comments should be disregarded and stricken from the record in this proceeding,"" the companies said. 
MOE said the issue it was raising -- whether El Paso made its unused capacity available to shippers on an IT basis, as required by FERC's open-access rule -- was neither the focus of the hearing last summer nor Wagner's initial decision (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1) <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20011101d.html>.. 
MOE said its review of the public portion of the hearing record suggests that El Paso may have committed ""potential violations"" of FERC's Part 284 open-access regulations by withholding IT capacity in an attempt to keep prices up at the California border, but it said there may be ""other potential explanations"" for the existence of unused capacity on the pipeline. ""We recommend a more complete investigation of the reasons why capacity went unused on the pipeline at times during the period [of] November 2000 through March 2001."" MOE conceded its motion was an ""unusual"" move. 
It suggested that the Commission either direct MOE to conduct a further probe, remand the decision to Judge Wagner for consideration or use other procedures. Although ""this step is unusual, it is not unprecedented for the Commission's enforcement staff to inform the Commission of its views regarding potential violations concerning a pending proceeding,"" MOE said. 
El Paso pointed to a statement by the judge to back up its claim that parties in the proceeding had agreed that the pipeline was full from November through March. 

Here is a copy of the El Paso Merchant Energy response summarized above.  They used some pretty strong language!!

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Barlow is not a good start in Week 14. He won't do much against a tough Miami defense that will surely limit his red zone production. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Hearst may not post good rushing numbers against the Dolphins. But the 49ers have often featured him as a receiver to keep defenses off balance, and may use him often as a passing target in Week 14.

Boo Williams <http://football299.! fa! ntasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=237007&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Williams is now the starter at TE for New Orleans. He will get regular red-zone looks from Aaron Brooks and may catch a few important TD passes during the Fantasy postseason.

Willie Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 12/14/01
Jackson is an inconsistent Fantasy wideout. But there is no way you should bench a player of his caliber during the Fantasy postseason.

Aaron Brooks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=133233&>, QB NO - Ma! tt! y Updated 12/14/01
Brooks is a boom-or-bust Fantasy selection in Week 14. If the Rams blitz him often, he may struggle, but he may also trade TDs with Kurt Warner. There is no way, however, you can bench him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Torry Holt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 12/14/01
The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularly featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Faulk will have another f! in! e game this week. He is a great start on Monday Night Football against New Orleans. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success this week. Expect fine numbers from him against the NFC West rival Saints on Monday Night Football. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Moore hasn't been a quality Fantasy player this year. Look for other options if you need TE help during the Fantasy postseason.

Jacquez Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Green hasn't been a good Fantasy player this season. Don't use him during your playoffs. Keyshawn Johnson is Tampa Bay's only productive wideout. 

Brad Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Johnson has been a mediocre Fantasy QB this year. He may struggle at Chicago this week. Other than Keyshawn Johnson, he doesn't have the weapons necessary to challenge the Bears' secondary. 

David Terrell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rando! m=! 559&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Terrell has disappeared from a statistical perspective. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
White hasn't been much of a Fantasy receiver this year. He is not worth starting during the Fantasy playoffs because of his lack of his regular production. 

Jim Miller <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1053&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Miller will struggle against the Buccaneers this week. He may throw more than one interception against Tampa Bay. 

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Franks may be good for a TD catch this week. Green Bay should move the ball rather easily at Tennessee.

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Schroeder should post good yardage numbers at Tennessee. The Titans' cornerbacks may have trouble with his speed on post and fly routes. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script! =p! layers&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Favre should toss at least two TD passes this week. He will certainly exploit every weakness in the vulnerable Tennessee pass defense. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Morton should reach the 100-yard receiving mark this week. The Minnesota secondary won't be able to handle the veteran receiver, especially on slant and post routes. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
If you desperate for QB help, consider McMahon this week. He may fare well against the awful Minnesota defense.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Chamberlain has been unreliable recently. Still, he is worth starting because the Vikings will face the inconsistent Detroit defense this week. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Carter should post respectable, if not spectacular numbers this week. He will find the Detroit secondary very easy to work against.! 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Moss is an excellent start in Week 14. He should catch at least one TD pass against the Lions.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Bouman is expected to start again in place of the injured Daunte Culpepper this week. He should find the end zone at least twice against the hapless Lions. 

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Up! da! ted 12/14/01 
Gardner has been a servicable Fantasy player this year, but don't count on him to find the end zone against the tough Philadelphia secondary this week. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Westbrook will face a very tough matchup in Week 14. Don't expect him to break loose from Philadelphia CB Bobby Taylor very often.

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Don't start Banks in Week 14. He will struggle against the Philadelphia secondary, and he may take several ! co! verage sacks and big hits. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard this week. The Giants should be able to exploit the holes in Arizona's secondary with regular strikes to Hilliard and Amani Toomer.

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Tommer is a good start in Week 14. He will regularly challenge the Arizona secondary with his quickness and separation speed. 

Frank Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Sanders hasn't been a much of a factor in the Arizona offense this year. Avoid using him during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=559&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Plummer may struggle on the road this week. The Giants may dominate a home matchup with the Cardinals.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play. Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday. ""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/26/01
Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01

Peter Warrick <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 12/26/01
Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1203&> , WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/26/01
Muhammad is still battling a turf toe injury. His status for Week 16 is still unclear. 

Larry Parker <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the Chiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/26/01

Fred Taylor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Taylor (groin) has returned to practices and is working with the scout team. He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this point of the playoffs. 

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/26/01

Ismail is recovering from a mild concussion. He is expected to play this week. 

Joey Galloway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Galloway is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1186&> , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Emanuel is day to day with an ankle injury. His status for the upcoming week is unclear right now. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
McKnight is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/26/01
Brunell is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
McMahon may miss some practice time this week with a foot injury. His status for this week's game is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start in his place if he can't play. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/26/01
Brookins may be able to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry Allen and Moe Williams will continue to split carries. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/25/01
Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01

Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.

Frank Player News

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff run. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but The Cincinnati Post reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Mathis continues to do nothing this season for Fantasy owners. Unless you're in a deeper league, holding onto the veteran wide receiver isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Staley could start on Sunday against Minnesota. According to published reports, rookie tailback Correll Buckhalter (shoulder) is still a little banged up, and Staley is the healthier back at this time. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
James has been downgraded to doubtful for Sunday's game against Miami and Colts Head Coach Jim Mora says he will not play. Don't use James this week, and instead consider u! si! ng Dominic Rhodes, who will start in his place.

Reuben Droughns <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=187528&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Droughns started last week's game against San Francisco, but he wasn't very productive. He split carries with Lamont Warren in the game, and had ten carries for 36 yards. The same situation will likely hold true this weekend against Tampa Bay, so be sure to avoid any Detroit backs outside of deeper leagues. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Morton had a down game against San Francisco last week, and could be in for another tough outing against Tampa Bay. The Bucs have the fourth-ranked defense in the league against the pass, so don't expect big numbers out of Morton this week. 

Lamont Warren <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Tampa Bay. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Green had a huge game against Tampa Bay last week, but don't expect the same type of output against Chicago. His numbers may in fact be down, but Green is too good to bench unless you have a a number of solid tailbacks on your roster. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face a Chicago team on Sunday that is a bit vulnerable to the pass, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in seven games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis. 

Mike Alstott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1169&>, RB TB - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
Alstott has scored four touchdowns in his last two games, and his success should continue this week against Detroit. Alstott's yardage numbers may not be very good, but he's definitely a good start in points-only leagues. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Dunn has struggled in recent weeks, but he should have a good outing against Detroit this week. The Lions are ranked 30th in the league against the run, so look for Dunn to come up big for the Buccaneers. 

Brad Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Johnson has been putting up decent numbers in recent weeks, and should continue that trend against Detroit. The Lions secondary is vulnerable to the pass, so look for Johnson to have a solid game. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Johnson could be in for a big week against Detroit. The Lions secondary is ranked 25th in the league against the pass, so look for Johnson to shine. He's a must-start in any Fantasy league. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Culpepper is coming off a bye and should be geared up to play against the Philadelphia Eagles and Donovan McNabb. Culpepper's numbers may not be great against a tough Eagles defense, but he's still far too valuable to ever bench. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Carter has had some b! el! ow-average yardage games this season, but he's still one of the best players in the league when it comes to finding the end zone. For that reason, it's tough to ever put him on your reserve list, even against a tough Philadelphia secondary. 

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Chamberlain has had a few bad outings in recent weeks, and may struggle against Philadelphia's tough linebackers. He has been a solid tight end overall, however, so starting him is still a good move unless you have a better option. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Moss is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia due to an ankle injury. The Eagles have a solid secondary, but Moss is still worth starting because of his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/09/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face a Niners defense that has been pretty solid against the run, but Williams is still a must-start. 

Joe Horn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Horn has had four straight solid performances, and is likely to have another against San Francisco. He torched the Niners for 15 catches, 285 yards and a score last season, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners this week.

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Jackson's numbers aren't mind-blowing, but he has been a decent option for Fantasy owners in deeper leagues this season. Unless you have better options on your roster, Jackson is worth starting this week against San Francisco. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Holt has been a solid wideout this season, and should continue his success against Carolina on Sunday. Be sure to start him this week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Bruce had a huge game before St. Louis' bye week, and he'll likely have another big performance in Week Nine. Look for Bruce to put up 100 yards receiving and a score against the questionable Carolina secondary. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Faulk (knee) has been practicing all week, and he will start on Sunday against Carolin! a.! He's a must-start against any team, so be sure to put him into your lineup. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Conwell has become a decent option at a position lacking reliable players. Unless you have a better option, Conwell is a good start against Carolina. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Warner could have a huge game this weekend at the Trans World Dome. He'll be facing a Carolina defense ranked 29th in the league against the pass, so 300-plus yards passing and three touchdowns is a definite possi! bi! lity. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Huntley will start this week against St. Louis, but he's not worth considering as a starter for your Fantasy team. Carolina will likely fall behing early in this game, which will force them to abandon their running game, leaving Huntley very few opportunities to produce. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Hayes has been hindered by a foot injury in recent weeks, but is expected to play on Sunday against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting! h! im is somewhat of a gamble. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Muhammad has done nothing in four straight weeks, and he could be in for another down game against St. Louis. With Carolina's quarterback situation up in the air and the prospect of facing CB Aeneas Williams looming, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad this week. 

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/09/01
Dayne has had three straight down weeks, but he'll have a good chance to break out of his slump this week against Arizona. Dayne has two touchdowns in his last two games verus the Cardinals, and may be worth taking a gamble on in larger leagues. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Hilliard has scored a touchdown in two straight games, and has put up decent numbers over the last four weeks. He's a good start this week, especially against an Arizona defense ranked 22nd in the league against the pass. 

Amani Toomer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2712&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Toomer was benched last week in favor of Joe Jurevicius, but he still had 69 yards receiving against Dallas. He's put up decent numbers against this week's opponent, Arizona, in the past, so starting him is a good move.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.

Steve McNair <http://football222.! fa! ntasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/01
Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy nu! mb! ers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Upda! te! d 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762! &k! ey=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

! Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=12411&!>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England. 

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble. 

Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&lea! gu! e=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=18738! 8&!>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay. 

Reuben Droughns <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rand! om! =2762&key=187528&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble. 

Lamont Warren <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2762&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.

By the time you finish reading this management report, you'll have gained a working understanding of power market risk-management concepts and practices. 
Risk management is a structured discipline that uses well-defined policies and procedures to mitigate a company's credit, market, or operational risks. It's a way of looking at an unstable factor, such as fluctuating fuel prices, and finding ways to offset the risk of that instability. Our Survival Guide will give you the tools you need to make risk management an integral part of your power market business. You'll discover:

As new entrants join the power market, bringing risk-management experience from other sectors, existing players need to get up to speed quickly. The Survival Guide supplies exactly what information these professionals need to get started.
""Power Market Risk Management: A Survival Guide"" focuses exclusively on risk management for power markets.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/28/01
The Packers took Davis off the physically unable to play list Tuesday and added him to the active roster. He is likely to challenge David Martin for the second tight end job, as Green Bay should use more two-tight end formations with Davis back in action. Don't add him to your roster, though, as he won't provide consistent Fantasy stats.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01
San Diego Head Coach Mike Riley sa! id! Monday that he is optimistic Jones will be able to play Sunday. He has been sidelined by an ankle injury.

Wade Richey <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12647&>, K SD - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Richey is likely to lose the starting placekicking job with the Chargers if they sign Steve Christie to a contract. San Diego would shift Richey to kickoffs only, after he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to 21-for-30 on the season. In that case, you should drop Richey from your roster.

Steve Christie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1378&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Chargers are expected to sign Christie on Tuesday provided he passes a physical, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. He would handle the field-goal chores for the remainder of the season, with Wade Richey shifting to kickoffs. If you're a Richey owner and need a kicker, Christie might be worth a pickup based on past history, but don't expect him to be one of the better kickers in the league even if he does get the starting job.

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 ! in! your league.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game against Miami. He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.

Keith Poole <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Jack! so! n's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.

Neil Rackers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.

Akili Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, coul! d ! return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.

Moe Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1481&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Upd! at! ed 11/27/01 
Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game. 

Jake Arians <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=192220&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01! Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami. Mora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. ""I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well,"" Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training camp. 

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Glenn could be put on injur! ed! reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patriots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coach Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. ""But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit closer."" 

Shayne Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=196720&>, K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Kevan Barlow <http://! fo! otball222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""It's throbbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01
Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protective boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player. 

Donald Driver <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=133276&>, WR GB ! - ! Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter. 

James Stewa! rt!  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
According to the Detroit Free Press, Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesda! y.! "" He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day to day. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/27/01
According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week.!

Latest NFL Player News

Thomas Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187390&>, RB ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/02/01
Jones will continue his backup role this weekend against Philadelphia now that Michael Pittman has been cleared to play. He won't get enough playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration, so avoid using him. 

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/02/01
Pittman has been cleared to play this weekend against Philadelphia. ""Pitt practiced (Friday), he's fine, he's going to play,"" Head Coach Dave McGinnis repor! te! d. With Pittman playing, it looks as though Thomas Jones will play a lesser role than what was earlier reported. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/02/01
Huntley is expected to start this week against Miami, but he's not worth considering as a starter for your Fantasy team. Huntley will struggle against Miami's tough defense, and the possibility for bad weather in South Florida makes him an even bigger gamble. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/02/01
Weinke has thrown five interceptions in his last two games, and has almost dropped completely off the Fantasy Football map. He's no better than a reserve at this point, so don't bother starting him against Miami. 

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/02/01
Jackson won't post excellent yardage numbers this week, but still may find the end zone. The Saints will depend on the run against the Jets, yet they may look to Jackson on play-action fakes and in the red zone.

Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Walls is a must-! st! art this weekend against Miami. He leads all NFC tight ends in receptions and is one of the more reliable Fantasy players in the league at his position. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/02/01
Williams should have an excellent outing this week. Expect him to rip major holes in the Jets' weak run defense throughout the game.

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/02/01
Muhammad has struggled in recent weeks, and facing a tough Miami secondary won't help his cause. He may be a top-notch Fantasy wideout, but it may be a wise move to reserve him this week if at all possible. 

Dez White <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
White remains a risky start each week. While his overall numbers have improved, he is still dropping passes, and may eventually lose the No. 2 receiver job to David Terrell.

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Smith has been adequate at best since taking over for the in! ju! red Jamal Anderson in Atlanta. New England has been suspect against the run this season, so don't be surprised to see Smith score a rushing touchdown and compile 80-plus yards on the ground this week. 

Marty Booker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Booker may not post great yardage numbers against the Browns, but the Bears should be able to spread the field and give him the opportunity to catch at least one TD pass.

Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Chandler has been an adequate starting quarterback for Fantasy owners this season, connecting on nine touchdown passes in five games. Unless you have a signal-caller with a better matchup, starting Chandler is a good move. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Mathis has been very unreliable this season, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a real gamble. He'll be facing Patriots' CB Ty Law this weekend, so try to avoid using him if possible. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 11/02/01
Morton should post good number! s ! against the 49ers this week. San Francisco's pass defense has been inconsistent, and the Lions may play from behind and pass the ball often.

Kevan Barlow <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 11/02/01
Barlow hasn't done much over the last few weeks, but he may find some success this weekend against the Lions' terrible run defense. If you're desperate for a tailback this week, Barlow may be a solid option. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Hearst could be in for a big game against Detroit this weekend. The Lions are allowing an average of 147.2 yards rushing per game, so be sure to start Hearst this weekend based on the matchup. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/02/01
Owens could have a huge game on Sunday lining up against the Lions' depleted secondary. Owens is one of the league's top wideouts and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Franks did not catch a TD pass in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. H! e ! has been a regular TD threat for the rest of the season, so don't bench him in any week.

J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 11/02/01
Stokes has been horrible this season, so starting him in any week is a serious risk. At this point, Stokes isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 11/02/01
Freeman caught only one pass for six yards in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. He may disappoint again this week, because No. 2 WR Bill Schroeder is not expected to play.! 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/02/01
Green totaled 124 total yards from scrimmage in his first meeting with the Buccaneers this year. Expect him to be a key receiver again for Brett Favre this week, especially with No. 2 WR Bill Schroeder ailing. Favre may need Green to bail him out if Antonio Freeman is double-covered downfield.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/02/01
Favre threw only one TD pass and was intercepted three times in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. Expect slightly better numbers from him at home against the Buccaneer! s ! this week. Favre may throw more than one TD pass, but expect at least one interception as well.

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Harris has done nothing this season, and isn't even worth a roster spot at this point. Unless you play in a very deep league, the Dallas tight end should be left on the waiver wire. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Ismail has been an unproductive Fantasy player for most of the season, so starting him in any week in not advisable. In fact, ""the Rocket"" is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues at this point. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Westbrook finally had a productive game last weekend against the Giants, catching two passes for 83 yards and a score. His luck won't be as good this week against Seattle CB Shawn Springs, so avoid starting outside of deeper leagues. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/02/01
Gardner has emerged as Washington's No. 1 receiving option, and is worth starting this weekend against Seattle. The Seahawks' secondary has been average this season, and facing CB Willie Williams shouldn't present much of a challenge to the talented rookie. 

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/02/01
Dayne has been very inconsistent this season, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. Dallas has been surprisingly tough against the run, which makes Dayne worth starting in deeper leagues only. 

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/02/01
Barber has had some success in the past against Dallas, so don't be surprised if he scores a TD this week. He won't put up huge yardage numbers, however, so start him based on the type of league you're involved in. 

Kerry Collins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1013&>, QB NYG - Russell Updated 11/02/01
Collins finally had a big game last weekend against Washington, but he's still been very inconsistent overall. He's had moderate success against Dallas in the past, and is only worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3457&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 11/02/01
Hilliard will start opposite Amani Toomer on Sunday against Dallas, and is worth starting on Fantasy teams in deeper leagues. Hilliard has played well of late, and is proving to be a decent Fantasy player once again.

RE:     Jackson Prairie Storage Balance 

Effective November 15, 2001, and continuing through the winter heating season, 
Northwest Pipeline will begin posting on the WWW.1Line.Williams.com Daily Operational 
Report (DOR) its Jackson Prairie storage account activity.  The status of the JP account 
will be based on activity at the close of the previous gas day.  This information should 
keep customers apprised of the account inventory, whether it is increasing or decreasing, 
and whether an entitlement or operational flow order is approaching based on a weak 
storage level coupled with overscheduled volumes through the Kemmerer Compressor.  
Below is an example of how the information will be displayed. 

Jackson Prairie storage balance - Gas Day November 14, 2001. 

*Above 1,000,000 MDth           Increasing              Decreasing              Stable

Latest NFL Player News

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Barlow is not a good start in Week 14. He won't do much against a tough Miami defense that will surely limit his red zone production. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Hearst may not post good rushing numbers against the Dolphins. But the 49ers have often featured him as a receiver to keep defenses off balance, and may use him often as a passing target in Week 14.

Boo Williams <http://football29! 9.! fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=237007&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Williams is now the starter at TE for New Orleans. He will get regular red-zone looks from Aaron Brooks and may catch a few important TD passes during the Fantasy postseason.

Willie Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 12/14/01
Jackson is an inconsistent Fantasy wideout. But there is no way you should bench a player of his caliber during the Fantasy postseason.

Aaron Brooks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=133233&> , QB NO - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Brooks is a boom-or-bust Fantasy selection in Week 14. If the Rams blitz him often, he may struggle, but he may also trade TDs with Kurt Warner. There is no way, however, you can bench him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Torry Holt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 12/14/01
The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularly featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Faulk will have another fine game this week. He is a great start on Monday Night Football against New Orleans. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success this week. Expect fine numbers from him against the NFC West rival Saints on Monday Night Football. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Moore hasn't been a quality Fantasy player this year. Look for other options if you need TE help during the Fantasy postseason.

Jacquez Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Green hasn't been a good Fantasy player this season. Don't use him during your playoffs. Keyshawn Johnson is Tampa Bay's only productive wideout. 

Brad Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 12/14/01
Johnson has been a mediocre Fantasy QB this year. He may struggle at Chicago this week. Other than Keyshawn Johnson, he doesn't have the weapons necessary to challenge the Bears' secondary. 

David Terrell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ran! do! m=2608&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Terrell has disappeared from a statistical perspective. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
White hasn't been much of a Fantasy receiver this year. He is not worth starting during the Fantasy playoffs because of his lack of his regular production. 

Jim Miller <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1053&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Miller will struggle against the Buccaneers this week. He may throw more than one interception against Tampa Bay. 

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Franks may be good for a TD catch this week. Green Bay should move the ball rather easily at Tennessee.

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Schroeder should post good yardage numbers at Tennessee. The Titans' cornerbacks may have trouble with his speed on post and fly routes. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scri! pt! =players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Favre should toss at least two TD passes this week. He will certainly exploit every weakness in the vulnerable Tennessee pass defense. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/14/01
Morton should reach the 100-yard receiving mark this week. The Minnesota secondary won't be able to handle the veteran receiver, especially on slant and post routes. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01 If you desperate for QB help, consider McMahon this week. He may fare well against the awful Minnesota defense.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Chamberlain has been unreliable recently. Still, he is worth starting because the Vikings will face the inconsistent Detroit defense this week. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Carter should post respectable, if not spectacular numbers this week. He will find the Detroit secondary very easy to work against.

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Moss is an excellent start in Week 14. He should catch at least one TD pass against the Lions.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Bouman is expected to start again in place of the injured Daunte Culpepper this week. He should find the end zone at least twice against the hapless Lions. 

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Gardner has been a servicable Fantasy player this year, but don't count on him to find the end zone against the tough Philadelphia secondary this week. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Westbrook will face a very tough matchup in Week 14. Don't expect him to break loose from Philadelphia CB Bobby Taylor very often.

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Don't start Banks in Week 14. He will struggle against the Philadelphia secondary,! a! nd he may take several coverage sacks and big hits. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 12/14/01
Expect at least one TD catch from Hilliard this week. The Giants should be able to exploit the holes in Arizona's secondary with regular strikes to Hilliard and Amani Toomer.

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/14/01
Tommer is a good start in Week 14. He will regularly challenge the Arizona secondary with his quickness and separation speed. 

Frank Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/14/01
Sanders hasn't been a much of a factor in the Arizona offense this year. Avoid using him during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2608&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 12/14/01
Plummer may struggle on the road this week. The Giants may dominate a home matchup with the Cardinals.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Latest NFL Player News

Corey Bradford <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major scori! ng! threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/m! p/! elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=187510&> , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

! Mi! chael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01
! Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunda! y'! s game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

! David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. ! De! spite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.! 
Eddie George <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.

Albert Connell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1851&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capa! bl! e of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Anthony Becht <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leag! ue! =bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=798&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, pos! ti! ng six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gained 73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as d! ou! btful with a groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scrip! t! =players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/18/01
According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimor! e.! Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1025&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.! 
Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is day to day.! 
Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=236843&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Joseph suffered a bruised shoulder on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/17/01
Gadsden suffered a strained hamstring on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 12/17/01
Pinkston has no breaks in his clavicle. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Chad Lewis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&! ra! ndom=3213&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Lewis injured his groin on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the rest of the year. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for Week 15.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.
Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3213&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/17/01
The Buffalo News says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the severity of his injured right knee. ""It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not sure what's going to happen,"" Henry said. ""It's a part of football. It was an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went. Hopefully, it's not too serious.""

"Operational Flow Order","Message Description:  High Inventory System Wide OFO

Message Date:  11/02/2001

Message Text:  High Inventory System Wide Operational Flow Order (SWOFO)


      OFO Stage :                        2
      Inventory Level :                 High
      Noncompliance Charge :    $1.00 /Dth
      Tolerance Band :                 11%
     

PG&E's CGT has called a High Inventory System Wide OFO for flow day 11/03/2001.

High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily
usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.


Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.

"BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser","
Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

"Special Olympics - Need's Your Help","


Several Enron Bowling Association members  were unable to participate in the Special Olympics Bowl-A-Thon on Saturday November 17, 2001.  Your support is imporant to the success of the atheletes.

The purpose of the Bowl-A-Thon was to raise funds for the Atheletes with Mental Retardation to compete in year-round sports and  training that will enable them to develop not only physically but emotionally and socially.

Dennis Lee has received 100 T-shirts (sizes ranging from L to XXXL) to sell for a $25 donation to continue raising funds for Special Olympics.  We are asking each EBA member to sell  3 to 5 shirts.  

Please pick up T-Shirts from Dennis Lee   EB3982   ext. 31715

We appreciate your support especially during these uncertain times.

Thank You In Advance

"FUNDIES MEETING EVERY DAY BEGINNING NEXT WEEK","For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Gannon had a decent outing against Kansas City, posting 195 yards passing, two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) and an interception. Gannon is one of the best quarterbacks in Fantasy Football, and is a solid start during your league's playoffs.

Zeron Flemister <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=192169&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Flemister caught a two-yard TD pass at Arizona. He has become a regular target for Washington in goal-line packages.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don't depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league! =b! ige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Holmes had a monster game against Oakland, posting 277 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns. He's become one of the most feared tailbacks in the league, and has been one of Fantasy Football's most pleasant surprises. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Davis rushed for 110 yards and a TD at Arizona. He will give Fantasy players good yardage numbers during the playoffs, but touchdowns will continue to be a rarity for Davis.

La! ve! ranues Coles  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
The Steelers limited Coles to 20 receiving yards on three catches. Coles remains a good receiver for the Fantasy postseason, though, because he has been a regular TD threat all year long.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Chrebet caught five passes for 63 yards at Pittsburgh, including his first TD (18 yards). The Jets wideout has been unreliable for most of the year, and he remains a risky start during the Fantasy playoffs.

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/09/01
Ward had a huge game against the N.Y. Jets on Sunday. The talented wide receiver had 10 catches for 124 yards, and has become a pretty reliable Fantasy player this season. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Fuamatu-Ma'afala started in place of the injured Jerome Bettis on Sunday against the N.Y. Jets. He posted 50 yards rushing and a touchdown, which are respectable Fantasy numbers for a reserve tailback. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 12/09/01
Stokes caught one pass for 15 yards at St. Louis. Don't start Stokes during the Fantasy playoffs. He has been nearly useless for most of the season.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Garcia threw for only 146 yards, no TDs and was intercepted twice at St. Louis. Expect Garcia to quickly put such a forgettable outing behind him. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsisten! cy! , but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Ricky Proehl <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1208&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Proehl caught six passes for 109 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Don't expect such numbers from Proehl on a regular basis. He rarely becomes a featured target for Kurt Warner.

Duce Staley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 12/09/01
The Chargers held Staley to 21 rushing yards on 15 carries, but he caught five passes for 88 yards and a TD. The Eagles will find many ways to utilize Staley as the NFL regular season wi! nd! s down. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/09/01
Thrash caught five passes for 74 yards against San Diego. Thrash has not been a dependable receiver in recent weeks, and he may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Flutie threw for 307 yards, two TDs and was intercepted twice at Philadelphia. He has been too inconsistent to take most Fantasy teams deep into the playoffs.

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Graham caught five passes for 110 yards and two TDs at Philadelphia, but he did not catch a ball in the second half. The veteran wideout has been inconsistent all year long, yet he is still capable of having some big games. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 12/09/01
The Browns made Brady look bad. He threw for 218 yards, no TDs and was intercepted twice. Still, Brady has played too well this year not to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs,

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 12/09/01
Glenn caught four passes for 67 yards against Cleveland. If you desperately need receiving help right now, Glenn won't disappoint you if he stays on the active roster.

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Smith rushed for 76 yards and two TDs on 21 carries against Cleveland. He has always been a great red-zone runner, so expect a lot of scores from Smith during the Fantasy playoffs even if his yardage totals disappoint you at times.

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Couch threw for 244 yards, no TDs and three interceptions at New England. Right now, Couch is not playing well enough to start for any Fantasy team, and he is a very shaky backup.

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/09/01
Jackson rushed for 34 yards on 16 carries at New England. The rookie running back hasn't been very reliable this year, and he is a risky start during the Fantasy postseason.

Richard ! Hu! ntley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1456&> , RB CAR - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Huntley rushed for 67 yards and a TD on 23 carries at Buffalo. The Carolina RB won't visit the end zone often during the Fantasy playoffs, and his yardage numbers will always be mediocre.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Finneran had six catches for 92 yards against New Orleans on Sunday. If you play in a very deep league, you may want to give Finneran a reserve spot on your roster. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Muhammad started at Buffalo and caught eight passes for 104 yards. He also lost a fumble. Despite the turnover, Muhammad remains a good Fantasy wideout when healthy. 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Chandler started Sunday's game against Atlanta despite a slight ankle injury. He posted 233 yards passing, but was held without a touchdown. He's been very inconsistent in recent weeks, so avoid depending on him too heavily in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Van Pelt threw for 277 yards, one TD and one interception against Carolina. His erratic play makes him a risk during the Fantasy playoffs.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Tony Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary h! as! n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is advisable. 

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11. 

Tom Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.

Dolphins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=15&>, DT MIA - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.
Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain ! in! his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.

Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.

Tom Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ! ro! ster as an insurance policy if you can.

Jonathan Quinn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12632&>, QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Mark Bruener <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rando! m! =2125&key=1360&>, TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``! Th! at's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."" 

Benjamin Gay  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see."" 

Kevin Lockett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins. 

Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2125&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1140&>, RB OAK - G! ig! gles Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.

Steve McNair <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01 
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.! sp! ortsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12363&> , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."" 

Benjamin Gay <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see."" 

Kevin Lockett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins. 

Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis. 

Cecil Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133349&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Giants <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=19&>, DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01
According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Donald Driver <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133276&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Ravens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=3&>, DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. 

Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&r! an! dom=4658&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01
Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.! 

Terry Hardy <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.

"Puget Sound","Hi Frank,

Just thought I'd send you an email to give you the details we discussed today.  We bought 51,042 mmbtu from Puget Sound in May 2001 at Kingsgate.  They seem to think that they bought part/most of that gas back from us at Kingsgate.  However, I do not see a deal showing this purchase from Puget.  Can you ck to see if you did in fact sell this gas back to Puget?  The sitara # of the purchase from Puget is 623949.

Let me know if you need anything else from me.  Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks
Darla Saucier

		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their

subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 12/05/01
Glenn did not report to practice on Wednesday. It is uclear if and when he will play for the Patriots again.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1296&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/05/01
Kennison might see some limited action against the Raiders this week. Even if he plays extensively at some point, Kennison will have minimal Fantasy value.

Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=! 14! 696.2&random=368&key=1393&>, K - Free Agent Updated 12/05/01
Brien was signed by The Colts. With Mike Vanderjagt nursing a sore back, Brien will be used on kickoffs and could see some occasional field-goal work. He will be an accurate, reliable Fantasy choice if Vanderjagt misses any playing time.

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/05/01
An MRI on Moore's hip was negative, but he may still miss Sunday's game against Detroit. The Bucs activated Mike Roberg from the practice squad as a precaution. Don't use Moore this week.

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235! 24! 8&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/05/01
Thomas will test his strained hamstring in full-speed practice Wednesday. ""We want to try to get him healthy,"" Coach Dick Jauron told the Chicago Tribune. ""Hopefully by resting him for two weeks we'll have him back healthy. And James [Allen] has done an outstanding job in the meantime. If [Thomas] is not ready to go, we're comfortable with it."" Monitor Thomas' progress before you make a final decision on starting a Chicago RB this week.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Watters is close to returning from a shoulder injury, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""The plan is (for Ricky) to practice ! th! is week. Whether he can play this Sunday, that's another question,"" coach and general manager Mike Holmgren said. It is unclear whether Watters will take back the starting job from Shaun Alexander, although we think it's unlikely he will. However, Watters could take away carries from Alexander, hurting his Fantasy value during the most important weeks of the season.

Jon Ritchie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12652&>, RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Ritchie is expected to miss Sunday's game against Kansas City, and perhaps more, due to a sprained ankle. He will be replaced at fullback by Zack Crockett, who often gets goal-line chances.

Keith P! oo! le <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1779&> , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Poole could miss his second straight game Sunday against Seattle due to bruised ribs. He's merely a marginal Fantasy player to begin with, so don't use him if there is any question whether he will play.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/04/01
Smith is questionable for Sunday's game against Seattle due to his sprained left ankle. He will test the injury at practice on Wednesday, so monitor his progress before you make a decision on using him this week.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Rhodes is recovering from a srained right wrist and a low back bruise. However, The Indianapolis Star reports that he is expected to play in Monday's game. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
McKnight suffered a rib injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play Monday. The Miami Herald reports that he will resume practicing on Wednesday. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Chambers is expected to practice Wednes! da! y and The Miami Herald reports that he will play Monday. Chambers is recovering from a rib injury he suffered in Sunday's game. 

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Jackson, still recovering from an ankle injury, might play in Sunday's game against New England. The Akron Beacon Journal reports that he was held out of last Sunday's game in an effort to get him healthy for the last five matchups. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/04/01
Moss suffered a bruised right elbow during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh.! T! he injury isn't serious, however, and he is expected to start in Week 13 against Tennessee. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Cleeland, who has missed several weeks due to an ankle injury, is expected to return this week against Atlanta. In fact, the Times Picayune is reporting that Cleeland is probable for the contest. If you need a tight end for Week 13, Cleeland is definitely an option, barring any setbacks. 

Kris Mangum <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1672&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Mangum's neck injury may be more serious than what was originally thought. He continues to be hampered by the injury, and will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Davis was activated for Monday night's game against Jacksonville. He saw limited playing time, and won't make much of an impact from a Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Banks suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas. However, he is expected to practice on Wednesday and w! il! l remain Washington's starting quarterback in Week 13 vs. Arizona. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to the Washington Post, Alexander (broken fibula) is likely out for the remainder of the 2001 season. He suffered the injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas, and will be replaced by Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Moore underwent an MRI on his injured hip on Monday, and coach Tony Dungy said that he could miss Sunday's game against Detroit. Todd Yoder would start in Moore's absence, but neither player has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/04/01
Barlow, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo due to a shoulder injury, is expected to return to practice on Wednesday. He'll play in Week 13 barring any setbacks, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/04/01
Owens, who is still dealing with both foot and ankle injuries, will be in the starting lineup for the Niners on Sunday against St. Louis. Owens said he's still not 100 percent healthy but that he ""did better than I expected"" in Sunday's 35-0 win over Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Thomason is still nursing a hyperextended knee, and will likely miss practice this week. He's doubtful for Sunday's game against San Diego. 

Freddie Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to published reports, Mitchell is close to replacing Todd Pinkston as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver. ""They both play about the equal number of plays,"" coach Andy Reid said. ""Every week we're giving Freddie more responsibility, and he's coming along very well. He's the No. 2 wideout [behind Pinkston] at that position right now."" If you're in a deeper league and need a wideout, Mitchell may be worth taking a chance on. 

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Vanderjagt is expected to play this weekend, according to published reports. He suffered a pulled back muscle in Sunday's game. 

Daun! te! Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Culpepper's status for this weekend's contest against Tennessee is uncertain at this time. ""If his knee is in better shape, then he'll play,"" Green told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. ""If it's not, then he probably will not."" Todd Bouman, who threw two late touchdowns against Pittsburgh, would start in Culpepper's absence. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/04/01
According to the Chicago Daily Herald, Thomas should be back in the starting lineup this weekend. He will be limited in practice all week, but barring any setbacks he should be able to play against Green Bay. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Walls, who suffered a hyperextended ankle on Sunday, should be able to return to practice by Thursday. He's questionable for Sunday's game at Buffalo at this point, but he should be able to play barring any setbacks. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Bettis, the NFL's rushing leader, most likely will miss Pittsburgh's game against the New York Jets on Sunday because of groin and hip injuries. Bettis was listed Tuesday as doubtful, meaning there is a 25 percent chance he could play. Coach Bill! C! owher said even that might be overestimating his chances. ""We'll see how he is by the end of the week but, by listing him as doubtful, you can see where I'm heading,"" Cowher said. If Bettis can't play, he would be replaced by Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and Amos Zereoue. Fuamatu-Ma'afala had 12 carries for 74 yards Sunday. 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's injured ankle will be evaluated in practice on Wednesday. ""According to the doctor, we've got a chance with Chris this week,"" Reeves said. ""There wasn't a lot of swelling. It's going to be sore. Wednesday is going to be the key for him."" Michael Vick would start against New Orleans if Chandler can't go.

Frank Player News

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/30/01
Despite his recent troubles off the field, Smith is still one of the best receivers. Look for him to catch some passes this week and be a solid No. 2 wideout. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/30/01
Thrash suffered a bruised kneecap during Thursday's game against Kansas City. ""We really don't know what that is,"" coach Andy Reid told the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""He hurt it earlier in the game and went back out. We'll check on that."" Thrash had five catches for 65 yards in Philly's 23-10 victory. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 11/29/01
Hearst had 106 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Indianapolis on Sunday. Hearst has had three consecutive solid weeks, and is proving his worth as a Fantasy player. Buffalo's defense has been pretty shaky against the run, so starting Hearst in Week 12 is advisable. 

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/29/01
Mathis has been a huge disappointment this season, catching only 30 passes for 315 yards. He'll have no better luck against CB Aeneas Williams and the Rams in Week 12, so be sure to reserve him. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 11/29/01
Bruce may not be having his best statistical season, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis. He has four touchdowns in his last three games vs. Atlanta, so be sure to get him into your starting lineup. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 11/29/01
Schroeder seems to have fallen out of favor with Brett Favre in recent weeks, and his numbers have reflected it. However, his potential to post solid numbers is much too hard to ignore for most Fantasy owners, so taking a gamble that he and Favre will get back on the same page is advisable. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=368&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI 

I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. 

Answer - GG 

Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. 


Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA 

Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. 

Answer - GG 

Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. 


Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO 

I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? 

Answer - GG 

Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

How Does Your Team Stack Up? 

In head-to-head leagues, the Standings, Breakdown page shows your team's record versus each team in your league. If your league uses head-to-head record to break ties in the standings, this is the place to see how you stack up with your close competitors. The All column shows what your record would be against each team if you had played that team every week this season.

You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Dennis Taylor, Columbus, OH 

I have both Brian Griese and Tim Couch. Who should I start in Week 12? 

Answer - GG 

It's tough to bench Griese, but this is one week where you should consider it. Griese will likely be without wide receivers Rod Smith and Keith Poole, which leaves him to throw to Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole, two very inexperienced players. Denver will likely run the ball quite a bit against Miami as a result, which will limit Griese's productivity. Couch may not be the most reliable QB, but he does face a porous Tennessee secondary. Unless Smith is able to go for Denver, we'd have to side with Couch this week. 


Question - Rev. Mark A. Young 

Who would you recommend starting this week: Tom Brady, Brian Griese or Doug Flutie? Or should I pick up Kordell Stewart, Mark Brunell or Alex Van Pelt and start one of them? 

Answer - GG 

Considering the quarterback depth that your league obviously has, we'd suggest picking up Van Pelt this week. Griese may be without his starting receivers and Brady faces a tough Jets secondary. Flutie has a good matchup against Seattle, but he's been inconsistent. Van Pelt has an excellent grasp of Buffalo's West Coast offense, and he's facing a San Francisco unit that has been vulnerable to the pass all year. We'd hold onto both Griese and Brady, and suggest dropping Flutie for Van Pelt. 


Question - Paul Hershey, Corning, NY 

I've got a big showdown for first place in my league this week. I need to start three WRs out of these four: Cris Carter, Joe Horn, Marty Booker and Curtis Conway. Which three would you choose? 

Answer - GG 

When you're in a must-win situation, you've got to stick with your big guns. Carter always has the potential to find the end zone. Booker faces a pathetic Detroit secondary, and Horn has a great matchup vs. Carolina's league-worst defense. Despite the fact that Conway has a great matchup against Seattle CB Willie Williams, you've got to go with Carter, Booker and Horn. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Benjamin Collins, Brooklyn, N.Y.: Tiki Barber may have started the season slowly, but he's been one of the most reliable running backs in the league over the last three weeks. It seems Jim Fassel is losing more and more faith in Ron Dayne, which means more carries and consistent Fantasy production for Barber.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Darnay Scott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week. 

James Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. ! 
Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/23/01
According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01
Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01
Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/ht! tp! ://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. 

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01
Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=10! 97! &>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01
Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. 

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunda! y.! Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsist! en! t this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.

Travis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once a! ga! in. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

Priest Holmes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass! /H! ull Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Michael Vick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=235253&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Vick will return to his backup role this weekend against Green Bay. He may see some playing time in certain situations, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Mathis has done nothing this season in Atlanta, making him virtaully worthless to Fantasy owners. If you've still got him in a deeper league, continue to sit Mathis until he shows he's worth a starting n! od! . 

Reggie Kelly <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Kelly is doubtful for Sunday'a game against Green Bay due to a knee injury. He'll be replaced by Alge Crumpler, who may take over the starting job from Kelly from this point on. 

Tony Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player this season, and things won't change this weekend against Green Bay. The Packers sport a very tough pass defense, so starting Martin isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Gary may get consideration for a starting spor this week. The Broncos have apparently lost some faith in Mike Anderson. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Smith returned to practice on Thursday. There is still no offical word on hsi status for Sunday's game.

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1116&>, RB! D! ET - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Stewart (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday. He may miss Sunday's game against the Cardinals. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, it has been confirmed that James will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. He will need surgery to repair a torn ACL. Dominic Rhodes will start at RB for the rest of the year, and Kevin McDougal should be his backup.

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Graham may post good numbers at Oakland. San Diego will look to the air often if the Raiders concentrate on stopping the run.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Tomlinson may have a disappointing outing this week. Oakland's defense will be fired up to stuff the run after a very poor performance at Seattle.

Jerry Rice <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/15/01
Rice has not helped his Fantasy owners much in recent weeks. But he is still worth a start against the inconsistent San Diego secondary.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01
Brown should have another good game this week. He always seems to play his best in intradivisional matchups.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/15/01
Don't expect good numbers from Garner this week. A returning Tyrone Wheatley will steal some of his carries against the tough San Diego run defense.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/15! /0! 1
Wheatley is now listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Diego. He is a risky start because of his recent inactivity and the strength of the San Diego defense.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01
Gannon should rebound from a quiet week. Expect good numbers in an important home game with San Diego.

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15/01
Gary was inactive for the last two games, but he will now see carries again because Terrell Davis is injured. He still may not play e! no! ugh to help most Fantasy teams.

Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Clark will continue to get regular looks from Brian Griese. The Denver QB will now lean heavily on his TEs, because injuries and other factors have crippled the Broncos at wideout.

Dwayne Carswell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1328&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Expect Carswell to be a regular target for Brian Griese this week. Injuries at WR will make the Denver TEs more important in the passing game.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/15/01
McNabb had a huge game against Minnesota last weekend, and should have more success on Sunday at Dallas. He's a top-notch Fantasy quarterback worthy of a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Freddie Mitchell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Mitchell sprained his ankle last Sunday, but is expected to play this weekend against Dallas. He may emerge as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver with a few more good outings, and is worth stashing away on your roster. 

Keith Poole <http://football2! 22! .fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Poole may see a lot of action at wideout for the Broncos this week. Injuries have hit Denver hard, possibly pressing Poole into extra playing time. He has never been a reliable Fantasy wideout in the past, so don't use Poole until he proves he can be a factor in Denver's passing game.

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Pinkston has fallen out of favor with Fantasy owners after a strong start to the season. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Pinkston isn't even worth a roster spot at this point. 
Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Lewis had a subpar game against Minnesota last week, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He had two touchdowns against Dallas earlier in the year, and is worth starting in Week 10. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/15/01
Thrash has caught four touchdown passes in his last two games, and is worth starting this week against Dallas. He may be inconsistent at times, but when Thrash is good, he is capable of putting up solid Fantasy numbers. 

Brian Griese <http://foot! ba! ll222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 11/15/01
Griese's stats may be mediocre this week. The Broncos have been hurt by injuries at wideout, and Griese may have trouble finding open receivers downfield.

Joey Galloway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Galloway was terrible last week against Atlanta, mostly because of Ryan Leaf's inability to get the ball downfield effectively. Unless you play in a deeper league, Galloway isn't worth starting in Week 10. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Harris had two catches for eight yards and a touchdown last weekend, but he's been unreliable overall. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Harris isn't worth a roster spot. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Jackson has performed well this season, and he is a good start again this week. Expect him to challenge the Buffalo secondary throughout the day.

Raghib Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random! =2! 950&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most reliable reciever this season, which isn't saying much. Unless you play in a very deep league, the ""Rocket"" is better left on the waiver wire. 

Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/15/01
Alexander should have another standout game at Buffalo. It is doubtful the Bills' defense will be able to handle him, and he should be good for 100-plus yards and at least one TD.

"","Frank,

I have two questions for you.   First, I know you and I have had very little profession interaction, but I would like to ask for a letter of recommendation from you.  I have asked Mike, but as of now I've had no response.  I assume he is very busy.  I know Patti will put one together, but Steve South is truly the only other senior level trader I can ask, and I haven't seen him for a few days.  If you are not comfortable with this, I'd understand.  However, I would really appreciate it.

Finally, I am getting a few cold calls, and hearing of jobs within other organizations.  If you are available, I would like to bounce a few of the companies I hear from off you?  I know I won't find another Enron, but I don't want to work for company that is not well respected among the top traders.  For example, I've had interest from/with; Aquilla, Dominion Resources, Amerada HES, Goldman Sachs, Duke and Reliant.

I appreciate any assistance you can offer.

Thank you

Daniel D. Lisk
Enron North America

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/01
Chandler practiced Friday and will start Sunday's game against New Orleans after recovering from ankle and knee injuries. He's a decent starter, but only if you don't have a better option on your roster.

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/08/01
Bears Head Coach Dick Jauron said after Friday's practice that Thomas will start Sunday's game against Green Bay. Some published reports had him being upgraded to prob! ab! le for the game. Thomas looks safe to use this week.

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/08/01
Banks missed practice Saturday with an apparent stomach flu, but is still expected to start Sunday against Arizona. He's still too risky a Fantasy player to use in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 12/07/01
Look for Dyson to play well this week. He has overcome a nagging toe injury and should take advantage of a shaky Vikings defense. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Wycheck, still suffering from a lingering ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/07/01
George is expected to play in Sunday's game against Minnesota. He aggravated an ankle injury last Sunday and is listed as questionable for this week's game. 

Kordell Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&ke! y=! 1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Stewart has been an efficient passers and runner in recent weeks. Get him in your lineup if you need a QB. He seems to have established himself as a decent option for Fantasy owners. 

Elvis Joseph <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=236843&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Joseph is suffering from a shoulder injury but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Smith has been one of the most consistent receivers this season. Don't hesitate to get him in your active lineup every week. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Couch was pulled from Sunday's game but that was only because he was a little banged up. He should be a solid Fantasy starter this week. 

Benjamin Gay <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Gay is a risky start for this week. He will likely split carries with James Jackson. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=! pl! ayers&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league. He has struggled at times this season but is still on of the better runners in the NFL. 

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite his recent struggles. However, Kitna is not worth using in Fantasy leagues right now. 

Brad Louis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=187657&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Louis has been diagnosed with a torn groin muscle and will be sidelined for the rest of the season. He hurt himself on Wednesday and an MRI on Thursday revealed a tear. St. Louis was expected to be a backup tight end and long snapper. His injury won't have much of an impact other than to weaken the Bengals' depth at tight end. Kirk McMullen will be the No. 1. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Mcnair was limited in practice Thursday but The Tennessean reports that he plans to play Sunday. McNair has spent most of the week recovering from an arm injury. ""Right now the big thing is handing off,"" McNair told the paper. ""It's the motion, when you follow through on it, I just have to watch that! . ! I feel fine throwing the ball."" Keep him in your lineup this week unless you have a backup of equal value. 

Danny Farmer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=187533&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Farmer is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a sprained ankle. Farmer won't be too productive if he does play. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Brady, according to published reports, practiced Friday and will play Sunday. He is still recovering from an ankle injury. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/07/01
Brunell, according to published reports, practiced on Friday and will play Sunday. He is still recovering from a quadriceps injury. 

Jammi German <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=12390&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
The Cleveland Browns placed German on injured reserve Thursday. German missed the last two games with a knee injury. He had seven catches for 65 yards in six games this season. 

J! ames Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Allen has been a solid replacement for Anthony Thomas over the past two weeks. However, it looks as though Thomas will be back for Week 13 against Green Bay, which means that Allen will see a serious decrease in playing time. Unless Thomas has a setback, be sure to reserve Allen. 

Jim Miller <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1053&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season, which was evident in his Week 12 performance (124 yards passing, no TDs, one INT) against Detroit. With the Fantasy playoffs looming, start Miller is a huge gamble. 

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
White had a few decent weeks, but he's been unreliable lately. He's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season, so avoid using White at all costs. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/07/01
According to the Chicago Sun Times, Thomas will likely start on Sunday vs. Green Bay. ""Last week I was about 95 percent,"" Thomas said. ""When I'd go into my full stride, I'd feel a little twinge But now when I go into my full stride, I don't feel any pain."" Head Coach Dick Jauron will make the ! fi! nal call on Thomas once the medical staff clears him to play. Barring any setbacks, starting Thomas on your Fantasy team seems like a safe play. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Banks is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He is expected to start, but he's too risky to warrant a major role on your Fantasy team at this point in the season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He faces a decent matchup against Arizona in Week 13, however, so starting him in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Despite catching a touchdown last week against Dallas, Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Mike Alstott <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1169&>, RB TB - JWillie Updated 12/07/01
Alstott may get a few goal-line carries against Detroit, but his yardage numbers h! av! e been subpar for the most part. Unless you play in a touchdown league, playing Alstott is somewhat risky. 

Brad Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Johnson has been a real disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. He's been held without a touchdown pass for three straight games, and has been picked off three times over that span. He faces a good matchup vs. Detroit, but using Johnson should be a last resort. 

Jacquez Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Green put up decent numbers in Week 12, but he's still far too unreliable to consider starting on your Fantasy team. Avoid using him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3995&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 12/07/01
Holt is a must-start this week against San Francisco. This NFC West contest has the potential to be a high-scoring affair, which makes Holt a good play on your Fantasy team.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretc! h.! 

Trent Dilfer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from! a! Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=486&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Upd! at! ed 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him! . ! He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries lat! e ! in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1389&>, K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elin! k?! script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football222.! fa! ntasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Tori ! Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1! 87! 503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was abl! e ! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=486&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

"FW: Wishing you well","
As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

"IMPORTANT!  Actions this evening.","In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances that we should address, please reply to this e-mail and we will change our schedule accordingly.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

ATTENTION ALL SHIPPERS/NOMINATING AGENTS AND PLANT OPERATORS: 


Due to the continuing warm weather and other operational considerations, Public Service Company (PSCo) cannot accept either:

Imbalance payback gas from Shippers/Nominating Agents, or 
More gas than what is currently confirmed from each plant into PSCo's system. 



Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY for gas days November 3 - 4; if over-deliveries become a problem during this period, PSCo may activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback to PSCo for gas days November 3 - 4.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.


Sincerely, 


Monica Nedbalski

"Kern Las Vegas","
Patti, Stacey,

The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as -
Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission
Zone: Las Vegas
Facility: UNA - Las Vegas

It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of -
Harry Allen (2-4015)
Apex (2-4002)
Blue Diamond (2-4016)
Pecos (2-4013)
Lone Mountain (2-4012)

Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking
a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.

The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will
bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
Jason

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1236&> , WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&> , WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/28/01
A banged-up Smith Toe/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback. 

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/28/01
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day."" 

Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1393&>, K IND - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the c! lu! b wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/28/01
According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report, Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/27/01
Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1515&> , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/27/01
The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4024&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.

Latest NFL Player News

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Morgan suffered a shoulder injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Mason suffered a hip injury in Sunday's loss at Minnesota. His current status is day to day.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori U! pdated 12/10/01
Allen (hand) was able to practice on Sunday. Still, the Ravens are expected to start Moe Williams against the Steelers next Sunday while easing Allen back into action slowly.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Culpepper (knee) says he should be ready for next week's game against the Lions. The Vikings, however, may be prompted to sit him again because the game is on turf. Once again, Culpepper may be a gameday decision.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/10/01
Smith (ankles) was able to play on Sunday, but he was far from 100 percent. He finished with eight receptions for 66 yards. He should continue to be a reliable player during the Fantasy postseason.

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Bettis' status for Sunday night's game at Baltimore is unclear as of now. Bill Cowher told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he would monitor the RB throughout the week. ""He won't need to lobby me,"" Cowher said. ""If he's ready to play, he'll be playing.""

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/10/01
Owens suffered a hip pointer during Sunday's loss at St. Louis, but he was able to finish the game. 

Albert Connell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1851&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Connell has been demoted behind Robert Wilson and Wane McGarity on the Saints' depth chart. Connell, who was inactive Sunday, is now New Orleans' No. 5 receiver.

Larry Parker <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Parker suffered a bruised right shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland. His current status is day to day.

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Dick LeBeau said there is no QB controversy right now. It appears he will stick with Jon Kitna for now. ""I think I tried that a couple of weeks ago,"" he said of switching QBs.

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Walls started Sunday's game, but had to leave when his ankle injury flared up in the first half. He finished with one catch for nine yards.

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=188183! &>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/10/01
Smith sprained his right knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution notes Finneran replaced Shawn Jefferson as the No. 3 receiver in two-back sets on Sunday. Jefferson remained the No. 3 receiver in single-back sets. Finneran's added responsibilities in the passing game resulted in a career-best six catches for 92 yards.

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/10/! 01! 
Griese suffered a concussion in Sunday night's win over Seattle. He left the game in the third quarter and was replaced by Gus Frerotte. Griese said he expects to play next Sunday against the Chiefs.

David Boston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Boston caught six passes for 132 yards against Washington. Right now, because of his consistently high production, Boston is arguably the most valuable receiver in Fantasy Football.

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Jenkins caugh! t ! three passes for 33 yards and a TD against Washington. He has become a surprisingly reliable receiver for the Cardinals in recent weeks.

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 12/09/01
Rice had five catches for 57 yards and a touchdown against Kansas City. The future Hall of Famer is having a solid season, and could be a valuable player during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Gannon had a decent outing against Kansas City, posting 195 yards passing, two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) and an interception. Gannon is one of the best quarterbacks in Fantasy Football, and is a solid start during your league's playoffs.

Zeron Flemister <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=192169&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Flemister caught a two-yard TD pass at Arizona. He has become a regular target for Washington in goal-line packages.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, tw! o ! touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don't depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Holmes had a monster game against Oakland, posting 277 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns. He's become one of the most feared tailbacks in the league, and has been one of Fantasy Football's most pleasant surprises. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Davis rushed for 110 yards and a TD at Arizona. He will give Fantasy players good yardage numbers during the playoffs, but touchdowns will continue to be a rarity for Davis.

Laveranues Coles <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
The Steelers limited Coles to 20 receiving yards on three catches. Coles remains a good receiver for the Fantasy postseason, though, because he has been a regular TD threat all year long.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Chrebet caught five passes for 63 yards at Pittsburgh, including his first T! D ! (18 yards). The Jets wideout has been unreliable for most of the year, and he remains a risky start during the Fantasy playoffs.

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/09/01
Ward had a huge game against the N.Y. Jets on Sunday. The talented wide receiver had 10 catches for 124 yards, and has become a pretty reliable Fantasy player this season. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Fuamatu-Ma'afala started in place of the injured Jerome Bettis on Sunday against the N.Y. Jets. He posted 50 yards rushing and a touchdown, which are respectable Fantasy numbers for a reserve tailback. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 12/09/01
Stokes caught one pass for 15 yards at St. Louis. Don't start Stokes during the Fantasy playoffs. He has been nearly useless for most of the season.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Garcia threw for only 146 yards, no TDs and was intercepted twice at St. Louis. Expect Garcia to ! qu! ickly put such a forgettable outing behind him. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsistency, but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Ricky Proehl <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1208&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Proehl caught six passes for 109 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Don't expect such numbers from Proehl on a regular basis. He rarely becomes a featured target for! K! urt Warner.

Latest NFL Player News

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McMahon, being groomed as Detroit's quarterback of the future, will make his first start for the winless Lions at Tampa Bay this week. He will replace Charlie Batch, who likely is out for the season after separating his right shoulder in Sunday's 13-10 loss at Chicago. Ty Detmer will back up McMahon, and a third quarterback will be added later in the week. McMahon does throw downfield with some success, and he is worth consideration as a Fantasy backup. 

Jets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=20&>, DT NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
CB Aaron Glenn may miss up to four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more often to protect the secondary, but the unit may also allow more passing yards in the next few games.

Jay Riemersma <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Riemersma suffered a concussion in Sunday night's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/03/01
George aggravated an ankle injury on Sunday. He should be able to play at Minnesota next week.

Desmond Clark <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Clark suffered a strained groin in Sunday's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Kennison was signed by the Chiefs. Chris Thomas was released to make room for him on the roster. It is doubtful that Kennison will make much of an impact in Kansas City, even if he can work his way into the starting lineup.

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/h! tt! p://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Moore suffered a hip pointer injury Sunday and might miss Tampa's upcoming game. The Tampa Tribune reports that he is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday. Steve Yoder will start if Moore is unable to play. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
The Tennessean says X-rays were negative on McNair's left elbow. He is expected to play against the Vikings next week.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=15! 43! &key=12207&>, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Beasley suffered a stinger in Sunday's game. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that he is listed as probable for the upcoming game against the Rams. 

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/03/01
Vanderjagt suffered a pulled muscle in his back on Sunday. His statsu for the Dec. 10 game against the Dolphins is unclear.

Tony McGee <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1325&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McGee will miss the rest of the sea! so! n with a sprained knee ligament. He may be replaced by Nick Williams or Brad St. Louis. Neither player has any apparent Fantasy potential.

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/03/01
Barlow missed Sunday's game because of an injured shoulder. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/03/01
Bryson (ankle) was inactive for Sunday's game at San Francisco. His status for the team's next game is unclear.

Tywan Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=146523&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Mitchell will be the starting tight end now that Terry Hardy is out for the rest of the season. However, don't expect Mitchell to catch too many passes. He only has 14 receptions in 20 NFL games. 

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Hardy suffered a torn knee ligament Sunday and will miss the rest of the season. The Arizona Republic reports that Tywan Mitchell will be the starting tight end in his absence. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp! /e! link?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Thomason, suffering from a hyperextended knee, is not expected to practice Monday, according to The Philadelphia Daily Times. Thomason will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/03/01
Owens overcame a foot injury and played in Sunday's game. He caught six passes for 72 yards and touchdown. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Brown had a solid game, catching five passes for 63 yards and two scores against Arizona. With Jerry Rice on the other side of the field, Brown is having one of the best season of his illustrious career. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Gannon threw for 302 yards and three scores against Arizona. He did throw two picks as well, but he's still an elite Fantasy quarterback. 

David Boston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Boston had another great game, catching six passes for 1! 06! yards and a touchdown against Oakland. Boston continues to be one if the best wide receivers in Fantasy Football. 

Michael Pittman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 12/02/01
Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Martin caught six passes for 97 yards against the Rams. The veteran wideout has seen better days, though, and he is not a reliable Fantasy wideout. He will occasionally post respectable numbers, but he will also have many quiet weeks.

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Christian rushed one time for five yards against St. Louis and caught four passes for 16 yards. He became a minor factor in the game as the Falcons fell behind early. Christian is still worth a reserve spot on any Fantasy roster.

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/02/01
In addition to 70 rushing yards, Faulk caught six passes for 128 yards and three TDs. There seems to be no way of containing the best back in Fantasy Football. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/02/01
Warner bounced back from a forgettable Week 11 performance by tearing up the Falcons for 342 yards, four TDs and no interceptions. There should be little doubt that he is still capable of taking any Fantasy team to a championship this year.

Shaun Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Alexander rushed for 87 yards and a TD against the Chargers. Defenses are stacking their fronts against Alexander, but he is still managing to score enough to be a must-start player for any Fantasy team.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Hasselbeck threw for 202 yards, no TDs and no interceptions against the Chargers. While he has certainly cut down on his mistakes, Hasselbeck doesn't challenge defenses downfield and he doesn't deserve a spot on most Fantasy rosters.

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/02/01
C! on! way caught three passes for just 34 yards at Seattle. Still, he has remained healthy this year and should be a solid Fantasy wideout during these important final weeks.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/02/01
The Seahawks held Flutie to 195 passing yards, no TD passes and intercepted him twice. The veteran QB has been a disappointment for most of the year and he will not be a dependable Fantasy player in the final weeks of the season.

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Davis had only 53 yards rushing on 17 carries against Dallas on Sunday. He continues to have a mediocre season, which makes it tough for Fantasy owners to start him every week.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/11/01
According to published reports, the Falcons will rest Smith in practice this week. Smith, who is dealing with an assortment of leg and ankle injuries, could see less carries in Sunday's game against Indianapolis as a result of his ailments, which makes starting him a real gamble on Week 14. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
Bettis was feeling good following treatment on his groin and hip Monday. He hasn't r! ec! eived medical clearance, but the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that Bettis will probably play Sunday. 

Santana Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Moss could miss Sunday's game. He is suffering from a strained quadriceps and is listed as questionable. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/11/01
Brunell suffered a badly cut finger in Sunday's game. He is also suffering from a sore quadriceps. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Danny Farmer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=187533&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Farmer is listed as probable for Sunday's game. He is recovering from an ankle injury. 

Jaret Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12447&>, K - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals released Holmes off their practice squad Monday. The Bengals signed Holmes to the practice squad on Nov. 1 after Rackers went through a stretch of missing six of nine attempts. 

Neil Rackers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=187627&>, K CIN -! F! ree Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals released kicker Jaret Holmes off their practice squad Monday, an indication that Rackers' job is safe for the rest of the season. The Bengals signed Holmes to the practice squad on Nov. 1 after Rackers went through a stretch of missing six of nine attempts. 

Marco Battaglia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals have waived Battaglia, freeing him to sign with another team. Battaglia had an appendectomy Nov. 17 and was put on the reserve-nonfootball illness list the next day, leaving him ineligible to play for the Bengals the rest of the season. Battaglia has been working out and hopes to play for another team this season. 
Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The New York Jets might get to see Smith instead of Jon Kitna as the Cincinnati Bengals' starting quarterback next Sunday. Kitna, suffering from a finger injury, might be inactive this week. The Bengals were considering giving Smith a chance to start once they were eliminated. They want to find out whether the first-round draft pick from 1999 still fits in their long-term plans. Kitna's injury opens the way for Smith to get that audition. 

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Kitna hurt the ! mi! ddle finger on his passing hand during Sunday's game. He didn't miss a play, but the finger swelled overnight and was so painful on Monday that he couldn't grip a ball. ""I either sprained or tore ligaments on the inside of it,"" Kitna said. Kitna has started each of the Bengals' 12 games. Akili Smith could possibly start in his absence. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/11/01
Griese remained woozy on Monday after suffering a concussion against Seattle, and his availability for next Sunday's game at Kansas City is uncertain. Griese was hit by Seattle linebacker Levon Kirkland at the end of a 9-yard scramble early in the third quarter. He had to be helped to the sideline and didn't return. Griese will be evalauted on a daily basis. 
Chad Lewis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's win over San Diego. He might miss practice on Wednesday, but he's expected to play in this weekend's game at Washington. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Wayne played Monday and had one catch for 11 yards. He shook off an injury but is still a risky start because of his inexperience. 

Mik! e ! Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/11/01
Vanderjagt shook off a back injury and played in Monday's game. He connected on both of his field goal attempts.

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Chambers played Monday despite suffering from a rib injury. He caught three passes, two for touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver. He doesn't catch a lot of passes but has a knack for scoring toudchdowns and making big plays. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01 Wilkins strained his right hamstring in the first half of Monday's game and did not return. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/11/01
Owens, who is already dealing with both foot and ankle injuries, suffered a slight hip pointer on Sunday vs. St. Louis. However, the star wideout is expected to start in Week 14 vs, Miami, so be sure to include him in your lineup. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) was declared! i! nactive for Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll likely be listed as questionable for Saturday's game vs. Arizona, so use caution before starting him in Week 14. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
According to published reports, Culpepper (knee) will be listed as probable for Sunday's game against Detroit. ""We anticipate him making a lot of progress this week,"" coach Dennis Green told the Detroit News. If you have Culpepper on your roster, he'd be a good start against a porous Lions defense in Week 14, barring any setbacks. 

Panthers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=5&>, DT CAR - Free Agent Updat! ed! 12/11/01 
Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert will miss the remainder of the year due to an elbow injury that will require surgery. Gilbert is just one of a number of injured Carolina players that has made the Panthers' defense virtually worthless to Fantasy owners. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with a back injury that could keep him out of this weekend's game against Indianapolis. Jefferson is questionable at this point, according to Head Coach Dan Reeves. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Morgan suffered a shoulder injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Mason suffered a hip injury in Sunday's loss at Minnesota. His current status is day to day.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/10/01
Allen (hand) was able to practice on Sunday. Still, the Ravens are expected to start Moe Williams against the Steelers next Sunday while easing Allen back into action slowly.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Culpepper (knee) says he should be ready for next week's game against the Lions. The Vikings, however, may be prompted to sit him again because the game is on turf. Once again, Culpepper may be a gameday decision.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/10/01
Smith (ankles) was able to play on Sunday, but he was far from 100 percent. He finished with eight receptions for 66 yards. He should continue to be a reliable player during the Fantasy postseason.

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fant! as! y.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Bettis' status for Sunday night's game at Baltimore is unclear as of now. Bill Cowher told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he would monitor the RB throughout the week. ""He won't need to lobby me,"" Cowher said. ""If he's ready to play, he'll be playing.""

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/10/01
Owens suffered a hip pointer during Sunday's loss at St. Louis, but he was able to finish the game.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Opeational Flow Order","Message Description:  High Inventory System Wide OFO

Message Date:  10/26/2001

Message Text:  High Inventory System Wide Operational Flow Order (SWOFO)


      OFO Stage :                        2
      Inventory Level :                 High
      Noncompliance Charge :    $1.00 / Dth
      Tolerance Band :                3%
     

PG&E's CGT has called a High Inventory System Wide OFO for flow day 10/27/2001.

High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily
usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.


Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

NFL Reports Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Kinney is listed as questionable for Sunday's game because of a calf injury. He missed Monday's game because of the injury. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/14/01
Titans' head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennesean that Wycheck's sprained ankle is not a substantial injury. Wycheck suffered the injury Monday, but is expected to play in Sunday's game.

Shad Meier <http://football2! 22! .fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235120&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Meier is still recovering from thumb surgery and is questionable for Sunday's game. He would have gotten substantial playing time Monday against Baltimore had he played, but won't be needed now that the Titans have two healthy tight ends. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He has been sidelined for almost a month because of a shoulder injury. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
An MRI on Jones' injured shoulder didn't reveal any structural damage. However, his status for Sunday's game remains uncertain. 

Mike McMahon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, the Lions hope to give McMahon some limited action during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but this development means that Charlie Batch might lose some playing time, hurting his overall Fantasy value.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! el! ink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
An MRI revealed a small cartilage tear in Chamberlain's right knee, but he is not expected to require surgery. All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants, so feel free to use him this week.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/14/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Dwight (lung) is doubtful for Sunday's game. He has not been very healthy when productive, so don't count on him for much production from him during the rest of the season.

Troy Hambrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hambrick is dealing with a rotator cuff injury, but he's expected to practice later in the week. He'll likely start his third consecutive game this weekend if Emmitt Smith's knee isn't 100 percent by Friday. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/14/01
Smith (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. If he is unable to go, Troy Hambrick would likely start his third straight game, barring any further damage to his injured shoulder. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/14/01
Weinke (shoulder) was only able to throw on the sidelines Tuesday, but was expected to practice on Wednesday. If he is unable to play, Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start. 

Peyton Manning <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 11/14/01
The Indianapolis Star says Manning had a splint inserted to stabilize the teeth in his lower jaw. He is expected to start on Sunday.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Bledsoe has been cleared to play, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try and prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't appear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 appears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold o! nt! o the job past the Rams game.

O.J. McDuffie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McDuffie is ready to return to practice from the PUP list. He will be eligible for activation on Dec. 4, but he may still miss the rest of the season.

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/14/01
According to published reports, many veterans on the New Orleans roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks' inconsistency this season. The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see Jeff Blake under center, but that doesn't seem likely to happen. The coaching staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a top-notch NFL quarterback, so don't expect a change under center any time soon. 

Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee. He suffered the injury during last weekend's loss to Atlanta. Dallas' defense has played well, but they're an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspective. 

Jon Hilbert <http://football222.fan! ta! sy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=195687&>, K NO - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys, and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seder's absence. Hilbert's value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point, however, so don't bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

Tim Seder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=196725&>, K DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Seder is expected to miss several weeks of action after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta. The team has signed former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties in Dallas. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 11/14/01
Moore, who had hamstring surgery two weeks ago, will begin some light running on Wednesday. His status for the rest of the season is still unclear, however, so don't bother picking him up off the waiver wire. 

Terry Hardy <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
Hardy (shoulder) is expected to miss a few more weeks of action. Unless you play in a very deep league, holding onto him isn't advisable at this point. 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=b! ig! e01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/14/01
Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01
McNair will wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an injury during Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He had X-rays and other tests on his right hand Tuesday, and coach Jeff Fisher said the results were negative. But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNair's thumb, which he originally hurt last season in practice. He is questionable for Sunday's game. ""We put him in a cast until tomorrow [Wednesday]. We'll see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand,"" Fisher said. 

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job wi! th! Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/13/01
Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.

! Ed! die Kennison  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is ""unretiring,"" according to the Denver Post. While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianap! ol! is. His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence. 

Santana Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy re! ce! iver. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/13/01
Taylor is expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month because of a groin injury.

Frank Player News

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/12/01
Mathis suffered a dislocated finger on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1593&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/12/01
Schroeder may have re-aggravated his ankle injury during a TD celebration on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01
Gary has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against San Diego. This is the second week in a row that Gary will not suit up for a game. 

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 11/11/01
The Jaguars held Dillon to 58 rushing yards, but he did score on a seven-yard TD run. Even if opponents limit Dillon's yardage numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. He remains worthy of No. 1 RB status on many Fantasy teams.

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01
Smith had a big day rushing against Dallas on Sunday, posting 148 yards in Atlanta's 20-13 win. Considering the number of running backs that have sustained injuries this season, Smith is becoming the type of back Fantasy owners should consider starting every week. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/09/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face a Chicago team on Sunday that is a bit vulnerable to the pass, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 11/09/01
Bruce had a huge game before St. Louis' bye week, and he'll likely have another big performance in Week Nine. Look for Bruce to put up 100 yards receiving and a score against the questionable Carolina secondary. 

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/08/01
Plummer continues to be a mediocre Fantasy quarterback, but you may actually want to consider starting him this week against the Giants. He threw for 318 yards and two TDs in his last game against the G-Men, and has five TDs in his last three games against New York overall. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Smith had a huge game against Tennessee, catching seven passes for 120 yards. He is one of the top receivers in Fantasy Football and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1859&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Thrash caught four passes for 80 yards and two TDs at Arizona. Don't expect good numbers from Thrash every week, because he tends to disappear against more established defenses. He faces a Minnesota defense with a shaky secondary this week, however, so he may be worth the gamble. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3747&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Latest NFL Player News

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.

Ken Dilger <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.

Marcus Pollard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script! =p! layers&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1335&> , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of ! th! e injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.

Peyton Manning <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owne! r=! 14696.2&random=892&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/18/01 
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if ! th! e Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.

Curtis Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

S! te! phen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.

Walter Rasby <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1320&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end ! no! w that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige! 01! &owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will ! li! kely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive o! f ! the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp! /e! link?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1140&> , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01
The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/29/01
Johnson suffered a slight ankle injury during Monday night's win over St. Louis. However, he is expected to start in Sunday against Cincinnati, so don't be afraid to play him this week. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/29/01
According to the Contra Costa Times, Owens (ankle/foot) could miss Sunday's game against Buffalo. He missed pratice on Wednesday and could miss practice on Thursday as well. ""We've got ! si! x games left and I know what's at stake for this team"", said Owens. I've got to be smart about it (the injury)."" He is currently listed as questionable for Week 12, which could make him a risky start for Fantasy owners. 

Saints <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=18&>, DT NO - JWillie Updated 11/29/01
Cornerback Kevin Mathis missed practice on Wednesday due to a neck injury. ""I've been trying to play through it, but I think it has caught up with me,"" Mathis told the Times-Picayune. ""I start out the game fine, but after about the second tackle, the pain comes back immediately."" Mathis is questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina, which could be good news for Fantasy owners with Panther receivers on their roster. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Cleeland, who has been nursing a high ankle sprain for several weeks, returned to practice on Wednesday. ""He looked good out there running and catching the ball, but we'll see,"" coach Jim Haslett told the Times-Picayune. Cleeland has been upgraded from doubtful to questionable for Week 12, but he's still too risky to start on your Fantasy team unless you're extremely desperate. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Harris, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, practiced on W! ed! nesday. The team expects him to play on Sunday against Washington, but he's not reliable enough for Fantasy owners to consider starting in Week 12. 

Kris Mangum <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1672&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Mangum suffered a neck stinger during practice on Wednesday. His status for Sunday's game against New Orleans is uncertain. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/29/01
According to the Charlotte Observer , Muhammad is expected to miss this weekend's game against New Orleans due to a shoulder injury. Isaac Byrd will make his second consecutive start in Muhammad's absence. 

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Falcons <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=2&>, DT ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Cornerback Ray Bu! ch! anan missed practice on Wednesday due to flu-like symptoms. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against St. Louis, but his absence won't make Atlanta's defense any less attractive against the Rams' top-notch offense. 

Thomas Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=187390&>, RB ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Jones is dealing with an upper-respitory infection that caused him to miss practice on Wednesday. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game at Oakland, but he won't see enough carries to warrant a start on your Fantasy team.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Sanders missed practice on Wednesday due to soreness in both of his hamstrings. He is currently listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland, so be sure to monitor his status if you need to start him in Week 12. 

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Smith told the Denver Post he expects to play Sunday at Miami, but he won't be able to attempt to practice until at least Friday. Even if he does play, he won't be at full strength, and he may be limited.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/29/01
Davis said his! k! nee felt good in practice on Wednesday, and he will start on Sunday at Miami, says the Denver Post. Still, it is not clear how much he will play, and Davis will probably share carries with Mike Anderson.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/29/01
Jones did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game as he continues to battle a nagging ankle injury.

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Graham missed Wednesday's practice with a thigh bruise, and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Trevor Gaylor may have to start against the Seahawks if Graham cannot play.

Steve Christie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1378&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Christie was signed by the Chargers, and will replace Wade Richey as the team's placekicker. Richey will continue to work on kickoffs. Christie appears to be recovered from a groin injury that led to his release in Buffalo earlier this year. See how he performs in his first game or two before considering him for Fantasy purposes. 

Roland Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12829&>, TE OAK - Free Agent ! Updated 11/29/01
Williams has missed practice time with an ankle injury, and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game with Arizona. Mondriel Fulcher will probably start in his place if Williams cannot play.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Wayne (knee) is expected to return this week. Don't expect him to do much in the return from his latest injury. A rookie receiver who has not played regularly is always a Fantasy risk.

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 11/29/01
Smith is listed as probable for Sunday's game with a shoulder injury. The Miami RB hasn't played well recently, and he isn't the must-start player he was in 2000.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/29/01
Culpepper was scheduled to undergo an MRI Wednesday night as a result of continued stiffness in his left knee. He sat out most drills during Wednesday's practice, but is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The Vikings believe Culpepper may have sprained ligaments in the knee, and the severity should be known sometime Thursday. Hold off on making a decision on starting him for now.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=! 70! 5&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Gadsden is listed as probable for Sunday's game with a shoulder injury. The Miami receiver hasn't been consistently productive this year, and he is a risky start even when his health is not an issue.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=! 14! 99&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
There is a possibility Davis, who has missed the first 10 games of the season with a hamstring injury, could be activated in time for Monday's game against Jacksonville. He probably wouldn't be one of the top two tight ends, however, and we're skeptical that he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Glenn (hamstring) is now listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Jets, but may be soon downgraded to questionable and may be placed on injured reserve, says the Boston Globe. He worked out with players who were unable to practice on Wednesday, but did ! no! t work out in pads with the full squad.

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Batch practiced Wednesday and showed no ill effects of the pulled groin that forced him out of last Thursday's game against Green Bay. He is expected to start Sunday against Chicago, but is only worth using in Fantasy leagues if you have no other reliable QB on your roster.

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Stewart's ankle, which kept him out of four straight games prior to last Sunday, is still a source of constant pain, according ! to! the Detroit Free Press. ""My ankle's still sore,"" he said. ""It's something that's going to bother me, and I don't think it's going to stop bothering me until the season's over. Hopefully, I can just get through the season without further injuring it, and continue to play on it."" Stewart remains a good play in Fantasy leagues only based on the matchup - this week's game against the Bears is unfavorable, so only use him if you're lacking in options at running back.

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/29/01
Thomas ran lightly in practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit due to a pulled right hamstring. He hopes to practice Thursday, and a decision on his status for the game might come later in the week, possibl! y ! Saturday. If Thomas can't go, expect James Allen to get the start. Hold off on starting either back until it's clear who will be getting the bulk of the carries against the weak Lions rush defense.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/29/01
Gonzalez should post good numbers against the Eagles. Philadelphia strong safety Damon Moore may have trouble handling the big, athletic tight end. At 5-11, 215 pounds, he becomes the one obvious mismatch for the Chiefs to exploit in the passing game.

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Green, who has been a Fantasy disappointment this year, may be in for a rough night against the Eagles. Philadelphia will blitz him often, and their cornerbacks will easily handle the mediocre Chiefs receivers. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Don't expect much from Pinkston, even against the erratic Chiefs defense. The Philadelphia wideout has not responded well to increased defensive attention after he played well early in the year.

Frank Player News

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 11/25/01
Hearst had 106 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Indianapolis on Sunday. Hearst has had three consecutive solid weeks, and is proving his worth as a Fantasy player. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/19/01
Mathis had by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. If you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider starting Mathis against the Panthers' weak pass defense. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a de! ce! nt Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.

Travis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of ! a ! disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

Priest Holmes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free ! Ag! ent Updated 11/21/01
According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble. 

Kyle Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.

Jim! my! Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1236&> , WR JAC - Frank Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=236843&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at running back.

M! ar! cus Pollard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?s! cr! ipt=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3232&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be Clark.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Latest NFL Player News

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Bennett is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. The Vikings will observe him in practice before deciding how much he will play. He may share carries with Doug Chapman.

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/07/01
Taylor has been upgraded to questionable for this week's game. His condition will be assessed at practice before the Jaguars make a decision. He still appears to be a very risky start for Week Nine.

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/07/01
Alexander (ribs) is listed as questionable for this week's game. Larry Parker would likely start in his place if he can't play.

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Burress is suffering from a shoulder injury but will start Sunday. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agen! t ! Updated 11/07/01
Zereoue, still recovering from a shoulder injury is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He missed last week's game because of the injury. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/07/01
Bettis is listed as probable for Sunday's game but will start. He is suffering from a sore wrist. 

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Dwight will miss Sunday's game with a collapsed lung. Reggie Jones will be the No. 3 receiver against Denver.
! Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/07/01
According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, Flutie (concussion) is expected to start against the Broncos. The veteran QB said he is feeling fine. ""I thought I felt great after the game, and I felt better this morning and I feel even better this afternoon; so, as far as I'm concerned, I'm fine,"" he said. He will be re-evaluated on Thursday, but the results are not expected to be of any consequence.

Freddie Mitchell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
According to published reports, Mitchell has moved past Na Brown and is now Philadelphia's No. 3 receiver. He will see an increase in playing time as a result, and might be worth picking up in deeper leagues. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/07/01
According to the Charlotte Observer, the MRI performed on Weinke's injured shoulder showed no serious damage. Carolina's medical staff has indicated that Weinke should be able to play on Sunday against St. Louis, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.

Jim Harbaugh <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1030&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Harbaugh was signed by the Carolina Panthers on Tuesday. He'll serve as a backup to Chris Weinke, and won't have much value as a Fantasy player this season. 

Bill Gramatica <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Gramatica suffered a dislocated shoulder last weekend against Philadelphia, but he isn't expected to miss any playing time. He'll kick wearing a shoulder harness to protect the injury, which shouldn't get in the way of his kicking duties. 

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
Brunell is dealing with a strained quadriceps and may miss practice on Wednesday. His status for Sunday's game against Cincinnati is uncertain at this time. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
According to Head Coach Jim Mora, there has been no new medical news on James' injured knee. He is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami at this point. 

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/06/01
Pathon (foot) hopes to be ready for Sunday's NFC East battle against Miami. The Colts' wideout has missed four games and is ! li! sted as questionable for the contest. 

Santana Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Moss (knee) will have his workload increased in practice this week. The rookie wideout will be listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Kansas City, but don't expect him to post big numbers even if he does play. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=29&>, DT TEN - Frank Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Dwight suffered a collapsed lung during Sunday's loss to Kansas City. He's expected to be released from the hospital on Tuesday, but there is no defintive timetable for his return to the filed. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/06/01
Faulk participated in p! ra! ctice on Monday and looked as though his knee was holding up very well. ""He's obviously been keeping in pretty good cardiovascular shape while he has rested the knee,"" coach Mike Martz told STLtoday.com. ""He looked fine out there today. We probably could have played him (Oct. 28 against New Orleans) but this is the best thing to do. He's in good shape."" If Faulk is on your Fantasy roster, be sure to get him into your starting lineup this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/06/01
According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Hasselbeck will start this weekend's game against Oakland. However, coach Mike Holmgren wouldn't dismiss the possibility of Trent Dilfer playing if Hasselbeck struggles in the game. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Buckhalter suffered a shoulder sprain during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is expected to participate in practice on Wednesday, however, and will be available for this weekend's game against Minnesota. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/06/01
Wheatley was inactive for Monday night's game against Denver due to a knee injury. The big tailback is day-to-day. 

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rando! m=! 1591&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/06/01
Glenn has told the league that he is suffering from chronic depression, which is the reason for his recent problems with the New England Patriots. As for his status for this weekend's game against Buffalo, coach Bill Belichick told the Boston Globe that ""he (Glenn) will be questionable this week. He's making progress."" 

Travis Henry <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 11/06/01
Henry suffered a hip injury Sunday but is expected to play this week. He was able to practice. 

Dedr! ic! Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1711&> , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Ward (foot) has been cleared to practice this week. Ward said that his foot was improving, but didn't seem too confident that he would be available for this weekend's game against Indianapolis. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/06/01
Taylor, who missed his fifth consecutive game this weekend, looks as though he'll miss Sunday's game against Cincinnati. Taylor will go through some individual drills this week, but coach Tom Coughlin doesn't seem optimistic that he will be ready in time to play against the Bengals, saying that he expects Taylor to return ""at some point."" 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/e! li! nk?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Despite splitting a few snaps with Mike McMahon in the first half of Sunday's game against San Francisco, Batch is still Detroit's No. 1 quarterback. ""Charlie is the quarterback of this football team,"" Mornhinweg told the Detroit Free Press. ""I want to make that clear, and I made that clear to Charlie as well as Mike. But it is important in developing a quarterback to get him some time in a league game when the game is still on the line."" 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/06/01
Gary was declared inactive for Monday night's game against Oakland. Now that Terrell Davis is back in the starting lineup, Gary's Fantasy value is very minimal. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
Davis started Monday night's game against Oakland, and was impressive in his return from injury. T.D. rushed for 70 yards on 17 carries in the game, and will likely remain Denver's featured back for the remainder of the season barring another injury. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Leaf will get his first start! a! s a member of the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday against Atlanta. He'll replace Clint Storner, who will now serve as Dallas No. 2 quarterback. Leaf looked decent in his short outing against the Giants, but he's not worth a roster spot on your Fantasy team at this point.

Gary was declared inactive for Monday night's game against Oakland. Now that Terrell Davis is back in the starting lineup, Gary's Fantasy value is very minimal. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1164&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/05/01
Hearst bruised his knee in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable for this week's game against the Saints. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1593&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/05/01
Schroeder missed his second consecutive game Sunday because of an ankle injury. However, he continues to make progress and should play this week, according to published reports. 

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=188183&>, Active RB Updated 11/05/01
Smith suffered a bruised shin Sunday. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/04/01
Mathis caught one pass for minus-two yards against the Patriots. He is definitely not performing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy reserve.

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Smith had a huge game against Tennessee, catching seven passes for 120 yards. He is one of the top receivers in Fantasy Football and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1859&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Thrash caught four passes for 80 yards and two TDs at Arizona. Don't expect good numbers from Thrash every week, because he tends to disappear against more established defenses.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/02/01
Plummer has been very inconsistent this season, so starting him as a Fantasy player is always a gamble. He had a solid game against the Eagles on October 7, but we'd avoid using him this time around as Philly looks to avenge an early-season loss to the Cards. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/02/01
Favre threw only one TD pass and was intercepted three times in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. Expect slightly better numbers from him at home against the Buccaneers this week. Favre may throw more than one TD pass, but expect at least one interception as well.

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 10/28/01
Bruce left Sunday's game in the second quarter with a reported broken left pinky tip, but was able to return in the second half wearing a splint.

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 10/28/01
Dillon rushed 27 times for 184 yards and two TDs, and also caught three passes for 18 yards and a score. While he has been an inconsistent back for much of the season, Dillon can tear apart poor run defenses like Detroit's. He's still a reliable weekly Fantasy starter.

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1262&> , WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't recommended. 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your playoffs.

Anthony Becht <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4495&key=187740&> , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Kevin Dyson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 12/07/01
Look for Dyson to play well this week. He has overcome a nagging toe injury and should take advantage of a shaky Vikings defense. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Wycheck, still suffering from a lingering ankle injury is expected to play in Sunday's game. However, he is listed as questionable. Don't expect him to be too productive. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/e! li! nk?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/07/01
George is expected to play in Sunday's game against Minnesota. He aggravated an ankle injury last Sunday and is listed as questionable for this week's game. 

Kordell Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Stewart has been an efficient passers and runner in recent weeks. Get him in your lineup if you need a QB. He seems to have established himself as a decent option for Fantasy owners. 

Elvis Joseph <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=236843&> , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Joseph is suffering from a shoulder injury but is expected to play Sunday. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Smith has been one of the most consistent receivers this season. Don't hesitate to get him in your active lineup every week. 

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Couch was pulled from Sunday's game but that was only because he was a little banged up. He shoul! d ! be a solid Fantasy starter this week. 

Benjamin Gay <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Gay is a risky start for this week. He will likely split carries with James Jackson. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league. He has struggled at times this season but is still on of the better runners in the NFL. 

Jo! n ! Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1847&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite his recent struggles. However, Kitna is not worth using in Fantasy leagues right now. 

Brad Louis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=187657&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Louis has been diagnosed with a torn groin muscle and will be sidelined for the rest of the season. He hurt himself on Wednesday and an MRI on Thursday revealed a tear. St. Louis was expected to be a backup tight end and long snapper. His injury won't have much of an impact other than to weaken the Bengals' depth at tight end. Kirk McMullen will be the No. 1. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=! bi! ge01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Mcnair was limited in practice Thursday but The Tennessean reports that he plans to play Sunday. McNair has spent most of the week recovering from an arm injury. ""Right now the big thing is handing off,"" McNair told the paper. ""It's the motion, when you follow through on it, I just have to watch that. I feel fine throwing the ball."" Keep him in your lineup this week unless you have a backup of equal value. 

Danny Farmer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=187533&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Farmer is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a sprained ankle. Farmer won't be too productive if he do! es! play. 

Kyle Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Brady, according to published reports, practiced Friday and will play Sunday. He is still recovering from an ankle injury. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/07/01
Brunell, according to published reports, practiced on Friday and will play Sunday. He is still recovering from a quadriceps injury. 

Jammi German <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=12390&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
The Cleveland Browns placed German on injured reserve Thursday. German missed the last two games with a knee injury. He had seven catches for 65 yards in six games this season. 

James Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Allen has been a solid replacement for Anthony Thomas over the past two weeks. However, it looks as though Thomas will be back for Week 13 against Green Bay, which means that Allen will see a serious decrease in playing time. Unless Thomas has a setback, be sure to reserve Allen. 

Jim Miller <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1053&> , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season, which was evident in his Week 12 performance (124 yards passing, no TDs, one INT) against Detroit. With the Fantasy playoffs looming, start Miller is a huge gamble. 

Dez White <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
White had a few decent weeks, but he's been unreliable lately. He's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season, so avoid using White at all costs. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/07/01
According to the Chicago Sun Times, Thomas will likely start on Sunday vs. Green Bay. ""Last week I was about 95 percent,"" Thomas said. ""When I'd go into my full stride, I'd feel a little twinge But now when I go into my full stride, I don't feel any pain."" Head Coach Dick Jauron will make the final call on Thomas once the medical staff clears him to play. Barring any setbacks, starting Thomas on your Fantasy team seems like a safe play. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Banks is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Arizona due to an ankle injury. He is expected to start, but he's too risky to warrant a major role on your Fantasy team at this point in the season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He faces a decent matchup against Arizona in Week 13, however, so starting him in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Despite catching a touchdown last week against Dallas, Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Mike Alstott <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&! le! ague=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1169&>, RB TB - JWillie Updated 12/07/01
Alstott may get a few goal-line carries against Detroit, but his yardage numbers have been subpar for the most part. Unless you play in a touchdown league, playing Alstott is somewhat risky. 

Brad Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Johnson has been a real disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. He's been held without a touchdown pass for three straight games, and has been picked off three times over that span. He faces a good matchup vs. Detroit, but using Johnson should be a last resort. 

Jacquez Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Green put up decent numbers in Week 12, but he's still far too unreliable to consider starting on your Fantasy team. Avoid using him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 12/07/01
Holt is a must-start this week against San Francisco. This NFC West contest has the potential to be a high-scoring affair, which makes Holt a good play on your Fantasy team. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key! =1! 294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 12/07/01
Bruce may not be having his best statistical season, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis. He has three straight eight-catch, 100-plus yard receiving games against San Francisco, which makes him a must-start in Week 13. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/01
Conwell is becoming increasingly unreliable as a Fantasy player. If you have a better tight end on your roster, you may want to consider benching him in Week 13 vs. San Francisco. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=566&key=1292&> , WR SF - Matty Updated 12/07/01
Stokes has been unreliable for the most part, but has strung together a few good outings in recent weeks. With the possibility of a high-scoring game against St. Louis in Week 13, Stokes is worth considering in deeper Fantasy leagues.

"Socal Window Meeting","Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
Anderson carried four times for 23 yards against San Diego. He won't play much now that Terrell Davis is healthy. Anderson was a disappointment when Davis was out as well, as he failed to match his 2000 form.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/11/01
Davis rushed for 83 yards on 33 carries and caught five passes for 36 yards against the Chargers. He is definitely healthy enough to start for most Fantasy teams, but ! Da! vis doesn't run with the same burst that once made him an elite back.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Flutie threw for 165 yards, one TD and was intercepted four times by Denver. Right now, Flutie is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/11/01
Conway caught three passes for 111 yards and a TD at Denver. He continues to be a reliable,a nd sometimes explosive Fantasy player.

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 11/11/01
Garcia, who is dealing with a sprained knee, had another big game against New Orleans. The Niners quarterback threw for 252 yards and four touchdowns, further establishing himself as a top-notch Fantasy quarterback. 

! Joe Horn, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Horn had a big game against San Francisco, catching six passes for 99 yards and two scores. Horn now has six touchdowns in his last three games against the Niners, and is putting up some big numbers after a slow start to the season. 

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Brooks had a huge game on Sunday, throwing for 347 yards and two scores against San Francisco. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him.

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Buckhalter rushed for 66 yards and a TD against the Vikings. But he will see his numbers and playing time dwindle now that Duce Staley is healthy and capable of being a dependable RB again.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/11/01
Staley rushed for 146 yards and a TD, and caught six passes for 85 yards against the Vikings. There should be little doubt about his health or current value after his stellar outing.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script! =p! layers&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Moss caught seven passes for 95 yards and a TD at Philadelphia. He padded his numbers well after the outcome of the game was decided, and he still does not have a 100-yard receiving game this year.

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Bennett did not play at Philadelphia. Doug Chapman started in his place and finished with 19 rushing yards and 45 receiving yards.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Chamberlain left Sunday's game after injuring his leg. He finished with two catches for 23 yards.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/11/01
Boston had another huge game on Sunday, catching nine passes for 137 yards and a touchdown against the N.Y. Giants. He's become one of the best Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Pittman was unimpressive on Sunday, rushing for only 54 ! ya! rds in Arizona's 17-10 loss to the N.Y. Giants. Pittman is best used when the matchup is to his advantage, and not as a weekly Fantasy starter. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Hilliard had only 43 yards receiving against Arizona, but he did score a touchdown in New York's 17-10 win. The score was Hilliard's third in his last three games. 

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
Barber had a solid game against Arizona, compiling 118 yards rushing in the Giants' 17-10 win. Barber hasn't been very reliable as a Fantasy player this season, but he is useful when the matchup is right. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Wayne caught only two passes for 18 yards against the Dolphins. The rookie receiver is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards and three TDs. N! o ! defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd.

Chris Chambers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Chambers had the best game of his rookie year, catching three passes for 113 yards and two TDs. He has certainly become a great asset to Fantasy teams that are thin at WR or need help because of injuries or bye weeks. 

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
McCardell caught five passes for 61 yards and a TD against he Bengals. The veteran wideout has been unreliable for much of the year, and he may follow his good performance with a quiet week.

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/11/01
Mack rushed for 71 yards and two TDs agains! t ! the Bengals. He may have restored Jacksonville's faith in him after some questionable outings, but Mack is anything but reliable.

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 11/11/01
The Jaguars held Dillon to 58 rushing yards, but he did score on a seven-yard TD run. Even if opponents limit Dillon's yardage numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. He remains worthy of No. 1 RB status on many Fantasy teams.

T.J. Houshmandzadeh <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235086&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Houshmandzadeh was Cincinnati's leading receiver at Jacksonville, catching six passes for 62 yards. Don't add him to your roster until he proves he can be a consistent contributor to the Bengals' passing game. Houshmandzadeh is a rookie, and he may fade away very quickly.

O.J. Santiago <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1633&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Santiago caught a 12-yard TD pass against the Steelers, and finished with two catches for 14 yards. Don't pick him up unless you are desperate for TE help, because Santiago has always been a Fantasy disappointment.

Kevin Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133324&>, WR CLE - Hunter Updated 11/11/01! Johnson caught a respectable eight passes for 62 yards against Pittsburgh's tough defense. Opposing secondaries are having trouble containing the third-year wideout, and he remains a must-start player every week.

Kris Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133236&>, K PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Brown made five of six field goal attempts at Cleveland, including the game-winner from 32 yards. Despite his troubles in Week Eight, Brown has been a reliable kicker for most of his three-year career in Pittsburgh.

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Burress caught four passes for 44 yards at Cleveland. The second-year wideout has yet to produce respectable Fantasy numbers on a consistent basis,

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Price caught three passes for 59 yards and a TD at New England. He continues to play well as defenses pay extra attention to Eric Moulds.

Latest NFL Player News

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1663&> , RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12207&>, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1034&> , QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3769&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/13/01
Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.

Eddie Kennison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is ""unretiring,"" according to the Denver Post . While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence. 

Santana Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.! c! om/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/13/01!

Jones re-injured his shoulder in Sunday's game. He had an MRI done on the shoulder Monday. His status for this week's game is uncertain. 

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Brunell is expected to play this week, despite suffering from a sore leg. However, he is not expected to practice. Nevertheless, look for Bru! ne! ll to be a productive No. 1 QB this week. 

Chad Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Johnson might play on a limited basis in Sunday's game against Tennessee. He will be re-evalauted on Tuesday, according to The Cincinnati Post. Johnson has been sidelined for a month because of a fractured collarbone.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/13/01
Glenn should be able to play Sunday if he practices with the team this week, according to The Boston Herald . He has not practiced in over three weeks because of a hamstring injury. The Patriots first two workouts are on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Brian Natkin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=236970&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Natkin started Monday's game. He was used to replace the injured Shad Meier and Erron Kinney. Natkin played the entire game but had only one catch for 18 yards. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/13/01

Jeff Garcia <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon. 

Reggie Kelly <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kelly suffered both knee and ankle injuries during Sunday's win over Dallas. He will have an MRI this week to determine the extent of the injury, and his status for this weekend's game against Green Bay is unclear at this time. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Grbac started in Monday's game despite suffering from chest/rib injuries. He threw for 192 yards and a touchdown, but was also intercepted once. Nevertheless, Grbac appears to have overcome his injuries and should be a solid No. 1 QB this week. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/13/01
Warner admitted to STLtoday.com that the thumb injury he sustained in the season opener against Philadelphia is effecting his ability to throw the ball deep. The team has begun extensive treatment on the thumb, and coach Mike Martz doesn't feel as though his Pro Bowl QB will miss any playing time. ""I don't anticipate this being a real problem unless he gets it banged and re-injured,"" Martz said. ""He has played pretty well with it since Philadelphia. We should be fine."" 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/13/01
Allen played in Monday's game against Tennessee but suffered a fractured left hand in his first and only carry of the game, during the second quarter. His status for Sunday's game is uncertain. ! 
Kevin Dyson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 11/13/01
Dyson played in Monday's game despite suffering from a toe injury. It appears he has recovered from the injury. He had six catches for 68 yards and a touchdown. Dyson should be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 wideout if he remains healthy.

Panthers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=5&>, DT CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Defensive end Sean Gilbert will likely miss a month of action after suffering a Grade II sprain in his left knee on Sunday. In other news, linebackers Dan Morgan (ankle), Dean Wells (calf) and Cory Minor (knee) will likely return t! o ! action this weekend against San Francisco. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/13/01
Weinke (shoulder), who missed Sunday's 48-14 loss to St. Louis, has been cleared to practice. His status for this weekend's game against San Francisco is still unclear, however, but coach George Seifert expects him to play. 

Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's final status for Sunday's game against Green Bay won't be determined until at least Wednesday. Chandler missed his last start due to a rib injury, but Reeves believes that Chandler will be available for the game. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/12/01
Davis has a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee and will be out 10 to 12 days, Mike Shanahan said. He will undergo surgery, and is not expected to play in the next two games. Mike Anderson will start in his place.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 11/12/01
Schroeder may have re-aggravated his ankle injury during a TD celebration on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/12/01
Bledsoe is expected to be cleared to return to practice this week, and he could be ready to play Sunday night against St. Louis. Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Monday he expects the team's doctors to give Bledsoe the OK this week. But that doesn't mean he will replace Tom Brady, who is 5-2 as a starter since Bledsoe's chest injury, as the starting quarterback. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/12/01
Warner says his thumb is affecting the way he throws the ball. X-rays revealed a sprained ligament, and he will be limited in practice this week.

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 11/12/01

Moss felt soreness in his ankle on Sunday, but he is fine and there is no apparent reason to ex! pe! ct him to miss any playing time.

Fantasy Football Matchups 

Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA 

Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? 

Answer - GG 

As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. 


Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL 

I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend? 

Answer - GG 

Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game. 


Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE 

Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks? Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available. 

Answer - GG 

Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12207&>, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1034&> , QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=641&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs.

Thanksgiving Football 

Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Marcus Howell 

Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego? 

Answer - GG 

Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has never been able to string many good performances together in the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post respectable numbers at Dallas. 


Question - Eric Fernau 

Which three running backs should I start? I have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest Holmes and Garrison Hearst. 

Answer - GG 

Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. Staley should have little trouble ripping through the Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game. 


Question - Jay Rassat 

Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle). 

Answer - GG 

Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New England QB. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a back like Alexander.

Latest NFL Player News

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/24/01
Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from his second arthroscopic surgery this year. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/24/01
Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game. 

Darnay Scott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week. 

James Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin! Updated 11/23/01
According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01
Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
The Jacksonvil! le! Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01
Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. 

Rod Smith <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01
Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&> , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01
Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. 

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.

Travis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of ! a ! disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."" 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB D! AL! - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.

Eddie Kennison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. 

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1790&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Jo! ne! s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.

Larry Centers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free A! ge! nt Updated 10/28/01
Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.

Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01
! The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 10/28/01
Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Amani Toomer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01
Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter w! ha! t the opposition is.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01
Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sund! ay! at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01
Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/28/01
Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rand! om! =3664&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 10/28/01
Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.

Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.

Clint Stoerner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3664&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

Latest NFL Player News

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game agains! t ! Miami. He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.

Keith Poole <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.

Neil Rackers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.

Akili Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.

M! o! e Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1481&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game. 

Jake Arians <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=192220&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/2! 7/! 01
Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami. Mora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. ""I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well,"" Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training camp. 

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patriots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coach Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. ""But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit closer."" 

Shayne Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=196720&>, K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.! co! m/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""It's throbbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01
Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protec! ti! ve boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player. 

Donald Driver <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=133276&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter. 

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day to day. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Upda! te! d 11/27/01
According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week. 

Brad Hoover <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=192294&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. ""There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gone through times like this,"" coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer. ""Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not."" While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues. 

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However,! h! e is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. ""I'll be there,"" Sanders told the Arizona Republic. ""They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear."" In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondary. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 11/27/01
Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. ""He hasn't made a lot of progress,"" coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""We're going to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decision."" Moore, who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this week.

Message Date:  11/23/2001

Message Text:  High Inventory System Wide Operational Flow Order (SWOFO)


      OFO Stage :                        3
      Inventory Level :                 High
      Noncompliance Charge :    $5.00/Dth

PG&E's CGT has called a High Inventory System Wide OFO for flow day 11/24/2001.

High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily
usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.


Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

"PROS Energy Web Seminar Series - a Resounding Success","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PROS Revenue Management's Energy Web Seminar Series 
a ""Resounding Success""

December 10, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in revenue management science and software, and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced the success of its Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminar Series held December 5-7, 2001.  Each seminar in the series discussed the benefits of PROS commercial optimization systems in the natural gas industry.  Each seminar included case studies which provided participants an insight to the practical applications of PROS science-based optimization systems.  Focused on pipelines, storage, and trading, these seminars enabled participants from various areas of the energy industry to take advantage of pricing and revenue optimization best practices.  

""These seminars were a resounding success,"" says Matt Johnson, PROS' Senior VP of Energy.  ""PROS is continuing to take the leadership role for transfer of our mature revenue management science and technology into the energy industry.  Based on the positive feedback of key energy first-movers, we anticipate several more of these innovative, interactive seminars in 2002.  These sessions allowed attendees to have access to free, informative business case studies reflecting state-of-the-art energy revenue management.""

The PROS Trading Optimization System can increase gas trading profitability by 10-15% by generating the optimal routing of supply to market given all pipeline contract constraints, gas purchase and sale obligations, and trading opportunities. The system recommends optimal spot gas buy/sell strategies and provides real-time physical position and opportunity cost data between any two points on the pipeline network. The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.

The PROS Storage Revenue Management System has been shown to increase revenues from the sale of storage capacity by 7-25% after initial implementations.  This system provides pipelines, storage marketers and traders with the ability to maximize revenue from the sale of storage services and contracts.  It provides the comprehensive ability to analyze the value of storage using PROS' state-of-the-art revenue management science and to execute and track those deals in real-time.  

The PROS Transportation Revenue Management System has demonstrated a revenue lift of 7-15% for firm transportation services in both open-season and negotiated sales environments. It allows natural gas pipelines to maximize revenue from the sale of transportation capacity. The system uses PROS' mature forecasting technology to predict demand for transportation contracts and forecast the customer utilization of existing contracts. PROS' price modeling and network optimization technology is used to provide pipeline capacity marketers with an optimal marketing plan that maximizes revenue from the sale of available capacity.


These products are based on the PROS Enterprise RM Platform, which uses world leading science, forecasting and optimization to generate revenue and profits for PROS' clients worldwide. The Platform is high performance, distributed computing, using parallelized, highly scalable technology.  This architecture will support the high performance, high availability, real time, and mission critical applications of our clients.  PROS' advanced architecture supports data intensive and calculation intensive, science-based enterprise solutions.

PROS 9th Annual Pricing and Revenue Optimization Conference will be March 3-7, 2002.  This premiere event will feature industry leaders participating in presentations, panel discussions, and product workshops. Join industry colleagues, academics, and representatives from the international business community at large to discuss relevant topics specific to the energy industry and to the practice of revenue management.

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Brown had a solid game, catching five passes for 63 yards and two scores against Arizona. With Jerry Rice on the other side of the field, Brown is having one of the best season of his illustrious career. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Gannon threw for 302 yards and three scores against Arizona. He did throw two picks as well, but he's still an elite Fantasy quarterback. 

David Boston <http://footba! ll! 299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Boston had another great game, catching six passes for 106 yards and a touchdown against Oakland. Boston continues to be one if the best wide receivers in Fantasy Football. 

Michael Pittman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 12/02/01
Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ran! do! m=718&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Martin caught six passes for 97 yards against the Rams. The veteran wideout has seen better days, though, and he is not a reliable Fantasy wideout. He will occasionally post respectable numbers, but he will also have many quiet weeks.

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Christian rushed one time for five yards against St. Louis and caught four passes for 16 yards. He became a minor factor in the game as the Falcons fell behind early. Christian is still worth a reserve spot on any Fantasy roster.

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.! 2&! random=718&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/02/01
In addition to 70 rushing yards, Faulk caught six passes for 128 yards and three TDs. There seems to be no way of containing the best back in Fantasy Football. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/02/01
Warner bounced back from a forgettable Week 11 performance by tearing up the Falcons for 342 yards, four TDs and no interceptions. There should be little doubt that he is still capable of taking any Fantasy team to a championship this year.




Shaun Alexander! , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/02/01Alexander rushed for 87 yards and a TD against the Chargers. Defenses are stacking their fronts against Alexander, but he is still managing to score enough to be a must-start player for any Fantasy team. <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187382&>Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Hasselbeck threw for 202 yards, no TDs and no interceptions against the Chargers. While he has certainly cut down on his mistakes, Hasselbeck doesn't challenge defenses downfield and he doesn't deserve a spot on most Fantasy rosters.

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1204&>, ! WR! SD - Giggles Updated 12/02/01
Conway caught three passes for just 34 yards at Seattle. Still, he has remained healthy this year and should be a solid Fantasy wideout during these important final weeks.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/02/01
The Seahawks held Flutie to 195 passing yards, no TD passes and intercepted him twice. The veteran QB has been a disappointment for most of the year and he will not be a dependable Fantasy player in the final weeks of the season.

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01! 
Davis had only 53 yards rushing on 17 carries against Dallas on Sunday. He continues to have a mediocre season, which makes it tough for Fantasy owners to start him every week. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Banks had a mediocre game, throwing for 216 yards with one score and an interception against Dallas. He is no better than a reserve on your Fantasy team. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Ismail had a big game for Dallas, catching three passes for 93 ya! rd! s and a touchdown against Washington. Ismail has easily been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but he's still a gamble for Fantasy owners. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Smith had his best game of the season, rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries vs. Washington. If coach Dave Campo gives him enough carries, Smith still has the talent and experience to be a productive Fantasy player.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
The Kansas City Chiefs are reportedly interested in Kennison. The team is expected to bring the wideout in for an interview and a physical as early as Monday, with the intent of signing him. 

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Hardy suffered an apparent knee injury during Sunday's game against Oakland. He did not return to the contest. 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Chandler suffered a sprained left ankle in the second quarter of Sunday's game against St. Louis. He was replaced by Michael Vick.! 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Brown caught eight passes for 59 yards at New York. The flashy New England wideout has not reached the 100-yard receiving mark in his last six games.

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Patten caught six passes for 60 yards at New York. He will be an occasionally spectacular, yet inconsistent wideout during the final weeks of the Fantasy season.

Santana Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=2352! 34! &>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Moss caught two passes for 40 yards against New England. The rookie receiver has already injected new life into the New York passing game, but he won't do enough statistically to help Fantasy owners.

Laveranues Coles <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Coles caught three passes for 63 yards and a TD against New England. The New York wideout has quickly emerged as his team's top receiver.

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Alexander left Sunday's game against Dallas in the second quarter due to an ankle injury. His return to the game is questionable. 

Obafemi Ayanbadejo <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1869&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Ayanbadejo caught a five-yard TD pass and scored on a nine-yard run against the Colts. He will be a regular goal-line threat for the RB-starved Ravens during the final weeks of the NFL regular season.

Moe Williams <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1481&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Williams rushed for 111 yards and caught three passes for 27 yards against the Colts. Williams, who also lost a fumble, took advantage of a leaky Colts defense, and he still has to prove he can perform well on a regular basis.

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Pollard caught four passes for 80 yards and a TD at Baltimore. Right now, he is arguably the most reliable TE in Fantasy Football.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Rhodes rushed for 42 yards and caught six passes for 25 yards, but he fumble! d ! twice. The physical Ravens' defense kept him off balance, yet Rhodes should still be a dependable Fantasy RB during the next few weeks.

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/02/01
The Vikings held Ward to three catches for 37 yards. Expect him to rebound quickly from his quiet performance.

Plaxico Burress <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Burress caught six passes for 86 yards against Minnesota. The second-year man is looking better as a route runner and mid-range receiver.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.

Jamal Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=187391&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01
According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabi! li! tate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/16/01
Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy p! er! spective. 

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fri! da! y's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=235174&>, QB CAR! -! Tori Updated 11/16/01
According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16/01
Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/01
Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull! Updated 11/16/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start. 

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01
Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense. 

Willie Jackson!  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. 

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01
Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is ! wo! rth considering. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01
Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of de! ep! er leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wo! rt! h starting based on his potential for big numbers. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01
Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01
Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Hayes ha! d ! only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble. 

Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers! , ! but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1558&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/10/01
Smith missed practice Friday and will be a gametime decision for Sunday's game. He is unlikely to play, and we don't recommend you use him this week. However, keep an eye on his status, as Troy Hambrick wouldn't be a great starter this week if Smith plays and takes away some of his carries.

Quincy Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/10/01
Carter is expected to suit up as the emergency quarterback for Sunday's game, a! cc! ording to The Dallas Morning News. It's highly unlikely that he will play, but we wouldn't recommend you use him as a Fantasy starter even if he was expected to start anyway.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 11/10/01
Schroeder will play Sunday after missing four weeks with an injured ankle. He is expected to start and is worth getting back into your active lineup against a subpar Bears' secondary.

Doug Chapman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=187510&>, RB MIN - Matty Updated 11/10/01
Chapman practiced with the Vikings' first team on Friday and is likely to start Sunday, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. He will share time with Michael Bennett if Bennett is able to play. We don't recommend you use Chapman this week considering he faces a tough Eagles defense and will share carries.

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/10/01
The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports that Bennett practiced with the second team on Friday, and the Vikings hope he can rotate with Doug Chapman on Sunday. It doesn't sound as if either player will get a large number of carries, so don't expect Bennett to provide your team with solid stats, particularly against the Eagles' defense.

Chris Weinke <http://football222.! fa! ntasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/10/01
Weinke missed his third straight practice Friday with a sore throwing shoulder and is unlikely to play Sunday against St. Louis. The Panthers will make a gametime decision as to their starting quarterback, but Matt Lytle is the likely starter with recently-signed Jim Harbaugh serving as the backup. We wouldn't recommend you use any Carolina QB this week, and you should also expect the Panthers' receivers to post subpar stats.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Staley could start on Sunday against Minnesota. According to published reports, rookie tailback Correll Buckhalter (shoulder) is still a little banged up, and Staley is the healthier back at this time. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
James has been downgraded to doubtful for Sunday's game against Miami and Colts Head Coach Jim Mora says he will not play. Don't use James this week, and instead consider using Dominic Rhodes, who will start in his place.

Reuben Droughns <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=187528&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Droughn! s ! started last week's game against San Francisco, but he wasn't very productive. He split carries with Lamont Warren in the game, and had ten carries for 36 yards. The same situation will likely hold true this weekend against Tampa Bay, so be sure to avoid any Detroit backs outside of deeper leagues. 

Johnnie Morton <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1223&>, WR DET - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Morton had a down game against San Francisco last week, and could be in for another tough outing against Tampa Bay. The Bucs have the fourth-ranked defense in the league against the pass, so don't expect big numbers out of Morton this week. 

Lamont Warren <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1112&> , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Tampa Bay. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues. 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Green had a huge game against Tampa Bay last week, but don't expect the same type of output against Chicago. His numbers may in fact be down, but Green is too good to bench unless you have a a number of solid tailbacks on your roster. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1028&>, Q! B ! GB - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face a Chicago team on Sunday that is a bit vulnerable to the pass, so be sure to start Favre this week. 

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in seven games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis. 

Mike Alstott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1169&>, RB TB - JWillie Updated 11/09/01
Alstott has scored four touchdowns in his last two games, and his success should continue this week against Detroit. Alstott's yardage numbers may not be very good, but he's definitely a good start in points-only leagues. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Dunn has struggled in recent weeks, but he should have a good outing against Detroit this week. The Lions are ranked 30th in the league against the run, so look for Dunn to come up big for the Buccaneers. 

Brad Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1039&>, QB TB - Matty Updated 11/09/01! 
Johnson has been putting up decent numbers in recent weeks, and should continue that trend against Detroit. The Lions secondary is vulnerable to the pass, so look for Johnson to have a solid game. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Johnson could be in for a big week against Detroit. The Lions secondary is ranked 25th in the league against the pass, so look for Johnson to shine. He's a must-start in any Fantasy league. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/09/01
Culpepper is coming off a bye and should be geared up to play against the Philadelphia Eagles and Donovan McNabb. Culpepper's numbers may not be great against a tough Eagles defense, but he's still far too valuable to ever bench. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Carter has had some below-average yardage games this season, but he's still one of the best players in the league when it comes to finding the end zone. For that reason, it's tough to ever put him on your reserve list, even against a tough Philadelphia secondary. 

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/0! 1
Chamberlain has had a few bad outings in recent weeks, and may struggle against Philadelphia's tough linebackers. He has been a solid tight end overall, however, so starting him is still a good move unless you have a better option. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/09/01
Moss is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia due to an ankle injury. The Eagles have a solid secondary, but Moss is still worth starting because of his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11! /0! 9/01
Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face a Niners defense that has been pretty solid against the run, but Williams is still a must-start. 

Joe Horn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Horn has had four straight solid performances, and is likely to have another against San Francisco. He torched the Niners for 15 catches, 285 yards and a score last season, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners this week.

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/09/01
Jackson's numbers aren't mind-blowing, but he has been a decent option for Fantasy owners in deeper leagues this season. Unless you have better options on your roster, Jackson is worth starting this week against San Francisco. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/09/01
Holt has been a solid wideout this season, and should continue his success against Carolina on Sunday. Be sure to start him this week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/09/01
Bruce had a huge game before St. Louis' bye week, and he'll likely have another big performance in Week Nine. Look for Bruce to put up 100 yards receiving and a score against the questionable Carolina secondary. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/09/01
Faulk (knee) has been practicing all week, and he will start on Sunday against Carolina. He's a must-start against any team, so be sure to put him into your lineup. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/01
Conwell has become a decent option at a position lacking relia! bl! e players. Unless you have a better option, Conwell is a good start against Carolina. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1044&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/09/01
Warner could have a huge game this weekend at the Trans World Dome. He'll be facing a Carolina defense ranked 29th in the league against the pass, so 300-plus yards passing and three touchdowns is a definite possibility.

Latest NFL Player News

Shannon Sharpe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01

Drew Brees <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=235197&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the season ends, says the San Diego Union-Tribune . He has been taking snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the Niners' goal-line back, says the Contra-Costa Times. ""It's a coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there."" The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/20/01

The New York Daily News says the pain in Hilliard's toe has worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play against Seattle.

McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week, although the Minneapolis Star-Tribune says he might have to throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01

Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver.

Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of swelling, he should play this week, says the Detroit Free Press. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1025&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01

Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the Baltimore Sun. He may start against the Bengals this week. ""I expect to see more time but I'm still not 100 percent,"" Allen said. ""My hand is going to bother me but I need to be out there on the field to help this team.""

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick told the Baltimore Sun. ""He's my quarterback now, he's going to be my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after that,"" Billick said. ""The only thing that would change that is if he chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury."" 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Michael Vick will not see action unless Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/20/01

Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB.

Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams.

"PROS Announces Record Third Quarter and YTD 2001","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PROS Revenue Management Announces Record Third Quarter and YTD 2001

November 20, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in revenue management science and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced that third quarter, although impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was a record revenue quarter for the company, and the company achieved low double digit operating income levels.  PROS posted revenue in the first nine months of the year of $27.7 million, which is a 36% increase over the previous year.  Record profits, along with positive cash flow, enhanced PROS' strong balance sheet.  PROS also posted record annual revenues and profits for 2000.  

""Our goal is to be the clear leader in the new Revenue Pricing Optimization category,"" says Bert Winemiller, president and CEO of PROS.  ""Our financial performance of record revenues, profits, and cash flow will enable PROS to maintain its commitment to achieving this goal and provide high value solutions to our clients.""

PROS Pricing Revenue Optimization Solutions' major milestones in the first nine months of 2001 include:

o In the airline industry, PROS completed signed contracts with airline companies, including Aeropostal, Air Jamaica, All Nippon Airways, Cathay    Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, and TWA/American Airlines. 
o Contracts were signed in the energy industry with major US gas pipeline companies.
o PROS concluded its second contract for Network Optimization (O&D) in the airline industry.  This product will become the standard for the       industry.  
o Energy Pricing & Revenue Optimization Seminars were held with participation from industry leaders and Accenture.
o PROS hosted its first Pricing Optimization Web Seminar which covered pricing optimization principles common among virtually all industries.       Participants included executives of some of the strongest Fortune 500 companies.
o PROS completed the move of its headquarters to the ComTech Center in midtown Houston.  This state-of-the-art facility will assist in the       support of PROS' expansion both internally and into other industries.
o PROS announced its 9th Annual Pricing and Revenue Optimization Conference, the largest revenue management conference in the world, with     industry leaders, analysts and representatives from industries such as airline, energy, healthcare, hospitality, broadcast, rental car, and rail.  The    Conference will take place March 3-7, 2002.

Peggy Hedstrom is working on having an EOL physical product created for internal use (or external if you wish). We will be able to buy and sell Kingsgate gas with you with this product, no legal problems. You should hopefully be able to just link it to either your Stanfield or Malin (preferably) product.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Watters is close to returning from a shoulder injury, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""The plan is (for Ricky) to practice this week. Whether he can play this Sunday, that's another question,"" coach and general manager Mike Holmgren said. It is unclear whether Watters will take back the starting job from Shaun Alexander, although we think it's unlikely he will. However, Watters could take away carries from Alexander, hurting his Fantasy value during the most important weeks of the season.

Jon Ritchie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=30! 88! &key=12652&>, RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Ritchie is expected to miss Sunday's game against Kansas City, and perhaps more, due to a sprained ankle. He will be replaced at fullback by Zack Crockett, who often gets goal-line chances.

Keith Poole <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Poole could miss his second straight game Sunday against Seattle due to bruised ribs. He's merely a marginal Fantasy player to begin with, so don't use him if there is any question whether he will play.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matt! y ! Updated 12/04/01
Smith is questionable for Sunday's game against Seattle due to his sprained left ankle. He will test the injury at practice on Wednesday, so monitor his progress before you make a decision on using him this week.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Rhodes is recovering from a srained right wrist and a low back bruise. However, The Indianapolis Star reports that he is expected to play in Monday's game. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
McKnight suffered a rib injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play Monday. The Miami Herald reports that he will resume practicing on Wednesday. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Chambers is expected to practice Wednesday and The Miami Herald reports that he will play Monday. Chambers is recovering from a rib injury he suffered in Sunday's game. 

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Jackson, still recovering from an ankle injury, might play in Sunday's game against New E! ng! land. The Akron Beacon Journal reports that he was held out of last Sunday's game in an effort to get him healthy for the last five matchups. 

Randy Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 12/04/01
Moss suffered a bruised right elbow during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury isn't serious, however, and he is expected to start in Week 13 against Tennessee. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Cleeland, who has missed several weeks due to an ankle injury, is expected to return this week against Atlanta. In fact, the ! Times Picayune is reporting that Cleeland is probable for the contest. If you need a tight end for Week 13, Cleeland is definitely an option, barring any setbacks. 

Kris Mangum <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1672&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Mangum's neck injury may be more serious than what was originally thought. He continues to be hampered by the injury, and will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Davis was activated for Monday night's game against Jacksonville. He saw limited playing time, and won't make much of an impact from a Fantasy perspective. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Banks suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas. However, he is expected to practice on Wednesday and will remain Washington's starting quarterback in Week 13 vs. Arizona. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to the Washington Post, Alexander (broken fibula) is likely out for ! th! e remainder of the 2001 season. He suffered the injury during Sunday's 20-10 loss to Dallas, and will be replaced by Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister. 

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Moore underwent an MRI on his injured hip on Monday, and coach Tony Dungy said that he could miss Sunday's game against Detroit. Todd Yoder would start in Moore's absence, but neither player has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues. 

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/04/01
Barlow, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo due to a shoulder injury, is expected to return to practice on Wednesday. He'll play in Week 13 barring any setbacks, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/04/01
Owens, who is still dealing with both foot and ankle injuries, will be in the starting lineup for the Niners on Sunday against St. Louis. Owens said he's still not 100 percent healthy but that he ""did better than I expected"" in Sunday's 35-0 win over Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Thomason is still nursing a hyperextended knee, and will likely miss practice this week. He's doubtful for Sunday's game against San Diego. 

Freddie Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to published reports, Mitchell is close to replacing Todd Pinkston as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver. ""They both play about the equal number of plays,"" coach Andy Reid said. ""Every week we're giving Freddie more responsibility, and he's coming along very well. He's the No. 2 wideout [behind Pinkston] at that position right now."" If you're in a deeper league and need a wideout, Mitchell may be worth taking a chance on. 

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/04/01
Vanderjagt is expected to play this weekend, according to published reports. He suffered a pulled back muscle in Sunday's game. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Culpepper's status for this weekend's contest against Tennessee is uncertain at this time. ""If his knee is in better shape, then he'll play,"" Green told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. ""If it's not, then he probably will not."" Todd Bouman, who threw two late touchdowns against Pittsburgh, would start in Culpepper's absence! . ! 

Anthony Thomas <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 12/04/01
According to the Chicago Daily Herald, Thomas should be back in the starting lineup this weekend. He will be limited in practice all week, but barring any setbacks he should be able to play against Green Bay. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
Walls, who suffered a hyperextended ankle on Sunday, should be able to return to practice by Thursday. He's questionable for Sunday's game at Buffalo at this point, but he should be able to play barring any setbacks. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/04/01
Bettis, the NFL's rushing leader, most likely will miss Pittsburgh's game against the New York Jets on Sunday because of groin and hip injuries. Bettis was listed Tuesday as doubtful, meaning there is a 25 percent chance he could play. Coach Bill Cowher said even that might be overestimating his chances. ""We'll see how he is by the end of the week but, by listing him as doubtful, you can see where I'm heading,"" Cowher said. If Bettis can't play, he would be replaced by Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and Amos Zereoue. Fuamatu-Ma'afala had 12 carries for 74 yards Sunday. 

Chris Chandler!  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/01
According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's injured ankle will be evaluated in practice on Wednesday. ""According to the doctor, we've got a chance with Chris this week,"" Reeves said. ""There wasn't a lot of swelling. It's going to be sore. Wednesday is going to be the key for him."" Michael Vick would start against New Orleans if Chandler can't go. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McMahon, being groomed as Detroit's quarterback of the future, will make his first start for the winless Lions at Tampa Bay this week. He will replace Charlie Batch, who likely is out for the season after separating his right shoulder in Sunday's 13-10 loss at Chicago. Ty Detmer will back up McMahon, and a third quarterback will be added later in the week. McMahon does throw downfield with some success, and he is worth consideration as a Fantasy backup. 

Jets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=20&>, DT NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
CB Aaron Glenn may miss up to four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more often to protect the secondary, but the unit may also allow more passing yards in the next few games.! 

Jay Riemersma <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Riemersma suffered a concussion in Sunday night's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/03/01
George aggravated an ankle injury on Sunday. He should be able to play at Minnesota next week.

Desmond Clark <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3088&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Clark suffered a strained groin in Sunday's game. His current status is day to day.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 11/30/01
Warrick missed practice on Thursday because of a sore shoulder. However, published reports state that he still expects to play Sunday. 

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 11/30/01
The Buffalo News says Johnson's season is all but done because of his broken collarbone. He may not play again this year, so it appears safe to continue using Alex Van Pelt if you have him on your roster. Johnson was waering a harness o! n ! Thursday, and he may be placed on injured reserve.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Wayne (knee) is now expected to miss Sunday's game. Terrence Wilkins will start in his place again.

Trevor Insley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=188095&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/30/01
Insley is now expected to miss Sunday's game. He has not sufficiently recovered from a concussion, says the Indianapolis Star. Tony Simmons will likely be the Colts' No. 3 receiver this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/30/01
Chrebet is still being bothered by a bruised shoulder, will not miss any playing time. The New York Post says he still looks good in practice.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/30/01
Glenn, who has been suspended for Sunday's game against the Jets, may have played his last game for New England. According to published reports, his locker has been cleaned out. It is time for Fantasy owners to cut the receiver if they still have him on the roster.

Jimmy Kleinsasser <http://football222.fantas! y.! sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=133340&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Kleinsasser (ankle) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. He isn't heavily involved in Minnesota's offesive game plan, so he has little chance to be a productive Fantasy player. 

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Bennett had his best rushing game of the season last week, going for 75 yards against Chicago. He's still been a huge disappointment overall, and isn't worth starting in most Fantasy leagues. 

Cris Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/29/01
Considering his past success, Carter has been very inconsistent this season. He could find it tough to be productive against Pittsburgh's top-ranked defense, but he's still worth starting based on his potential to put up solid Fantasy numbers. 

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Chamberlain posted solid numbers last week against Chicago, catching seven passes for 56 yards. He has been a bit inconsistent recently, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis unless you have a better option on! y! our roster. 

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/29/01
Moss will face a tough Pittsburgh defense on Sunday, which is ranked No. 1 overall in the league. He's hasn't been playing up to his high standards this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. 

Ricky Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=133448&>, RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Williams has finally stayed healthy, and has become one of the top running backs in Fantasy Football. Be sure to give him the start in Week 12 against Carolina, whose defense is ranked last in the entire league. 

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Davis is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Dallas due to a back injury. He's worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues against the Cowboys, but don't expect huge numbers from the big tailback. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Banks continues to be inc! on! sistent, especially over the last two weeks. He has been held without a touchdown pass over that span, and isn't worth starting against an underrated Dallas defense. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Despite catching three touchdowns in his last four games, Westbrook is still very unreliable as a Fantasy player. He did have a touchdown catch in his first meeting of the year against Dallas, but it was his only catch of the game. Unless you play in a deeper league, benching Westbrook is advisable. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 11/29/01
Holt had a huge game last week against Tampa Bay, catching eight passes for 139 yards. He should put up solid numbers against a questionable Atlanta secondary, so be sure to start him in Week 12. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Bruce may not be having his best statistical season, but he's still worth starting on a weekly basis. He has four touchdowns in his last three games vs. Atlanta, so be sure to get him into your starting lineup. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Faulk actually had a down we! ek! against Tampa Bay on Monday night, posting only 66 scrimmage yards and no touchdowns. He'll bounce back against Atlanta, and is a must-start in any Fantasy league format on a weekly basis. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Conwell played on Monday night against Tampa Bay despite a shoulder injury. He had only 38 yards receiving in the game, and is becoming increasingly unreliable as a Fantasy player. If you have a better tight end on your roster, you may want to consider benching Conwell in Week 12. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Warner has been very inconsistent recently, throwing six touchdowns and 11 interceptions over his last four games. He's far too valuable to consider benching, however, and he should bounce back against Atlanta in Week 12. 

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/29/01
Huntley's numbers have improved a bit over the last two weeks, but he's still far too unreliable to start on a weekly basis. Unless you're desperate for a running back, benching Huntley is advisable. 

Isaac Byrd <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1762&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Byrd w! il! l start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad for the second consecutive week. He posted five catches for 69 yards against Atlanta last week, and could be a decent sleeper against a vulnerable New Orleans secondary in Week 12. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/29/01
Hayes is a bit banged up, but he will start in Week 12 against New Orleans. The Saints secondary is questionable at best, so starting Hayes in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Wesley Walls <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Walls was held to only one catch for eight yards last week against Atlanta. He may not be as reliable as he's been in the past, but Walls is still worth starting on a weekly basis, especially in deeper leagues.

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/29/01
Taylor, still recovering from a groin injury, is listed as questionable for Monday's game. Don't expect him to be too productive this week if he does play. He is not at full strength. 

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Jackson was limited in practice Wednesday because ! of! a sprained ankle. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Benjamin Gay is expected to start in his place. 

Ahman Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Green has emerged as one of the top backs in Fantasy Football this season. As a result, starting him on a weekly basis is advisable, especially against inconsistent defenses like Jacksonville. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Freeman seems to have re-emerged as Brett Favre's go-to-guy in recent weeks, which is evident in his stats over the past four games. He'll post solid numbers against Jacksonville on Monday night, so be sure to start him in Week 12. 

Shannon Sharpe <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Sharpe is listed as probable for Sunday's game. He missed practice Wednesday because of a knee injury.

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=457&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
After a solid start, Franks has been held out of the end zone for four consecutve games. With the lack! o! f quality tight ends in the league, however, Franks is still worth starting in most Fantasy formats.

Latest NFL Player News

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportslin! e.! com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day. 

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235201&> , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason. 

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fanta! sy! value might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football. 

Kevin Lockett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. ! 
Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dalla! s ! faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1268&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 




Bert Emanuel! , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1186&>Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10! t! imes for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan! , ! who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Terrell caught o! ne! pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2709&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/01
Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk beca! us! e of his inconsistency. 

Qadry Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1514&>, WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01
Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01
Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ra! nd! om=734&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss. 

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01
Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. 

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Jackson had a ! go! od outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Joe Horn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/25/01
Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers

Tom Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.

Eric Moulds <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01
Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.

Alex Van Pelt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/25/01
Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.

Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01
The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too in! co! nsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch. 

Ki-Jana Carter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1089&>, RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.

Isaac Byrd <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1762&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01
Muhammad missed S! un! day's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place. 

Tim Dwight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is day to day. 

Chris Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to play this week. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/19/01
Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/19/01
Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gained 73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/18/01
According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1025&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133415&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. N! on! e of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts. 

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the Arizona Republic, Gramatica will miss nine months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the team's placekicker. 

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Watters' season has ended with a broken bone in his right ankle. Seattle coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said. The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time of the year for most Fantasy players. 

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some carries at George's expense, though.

Frank Player News

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 12/16/01
Smith had another good outing, catching five passes for 52 yards and a touchdown against Cleveland. The veteran wide receiver is a must-start every week. 

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 12/14/01
Plummer may struggle on the road this week. The Giants may dominate a home matchup with the Cardinals. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 12/14/01
Favre should toss at least two TD passes this week. He will certainly exploit every weakness in the vulnerable Tennessee pass defense. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 12/14/01
Schroeder should post good yardage numbers at Tennessee. The Titans' cornerbacks may have trouble with his speed on post and fly routes. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 12/14/01
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Smith's ailing knee has continued to improve, but Bob Christian may get the bulk of the team's carries on Sunday.

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsistency, but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Mathis continues to do nothing this season for Fantasy owners. Unless you're in a deeper league, holding onto the veteran wide receiver isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Warner admitted to STLtoday.com that the thumb injury he sustained in the season opener against Philadelphia is effecting his ability to throw the ball deep. The team has begun extensive treatment on the thumb, and coach Mike Martz doesn't feel as though his Pro Bowl QB will miss any playing time.

Latest NFL Player News

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori U! pdated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=236843&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01

Gadsden suffered a strained hamstring on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 12/17/01
Pinkston has no breaks in his clavicle. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Chad Lewis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Lewis injured his groin on! S! unday. His current status is day to day.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free! A! gent Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the r! es! t of the year. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for Week 15.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.

Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/17/01
The Buffalo News says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the severity of his injured right knee. ""It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not sure what's going to happen,"" Henry said. ""It's a part of football. It was an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went. Hopefully, it's not too serious."" 

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Gramatica may have a torn ACL. He was scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and might miss the season's final three games. 

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the team's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Te! nn! essee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks' numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn't reliable enough to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and two touchdowns. He ! di! d throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he's a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.

Quincy Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any league. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/16/01
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this wee! k ! on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. ""It's a small scope, not a big deal at all,"" Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. ""Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know."" Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/08/01
Garner rushed for only 36 yards on seven carries in his first meeting with Seattle this year. Expect much better numbers this time against a shaky Seattle run defense.

Jerry Rice <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/08/01
Rice caught five passes for 91 yards and two TDs against the Seahawks earlier this year. Seattle may focus more closely on him this time, but he should still be good for at least one TD catch.! 
Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/08/01
Brown caught three passes for 47 yards against the Seahawks in the teams' first meeting this year. He should perfom better if Seattle pays more attention to Jerry Rice (two TDs in first meeting) in this week's matchup. 

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/08/01
Gannon passed for three TDs and no interceptions in his first meeting with the Seahawks this year. He will still post good numbers in their second meeting, but his performance may be less sepctacular now that Shawn Springs is healthy.! 
Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/08/01
Staley has been a major disappointment this season, rushing for only 111 yards and one touchdown. He's losing carries to rookie Correll Buckhalter as well, and has become a very risky Fantasy player. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/08/01
McNabb has been impressive for the Eagles this season, compiling 13 total touchdowns with only four interceptions. He'll be primed for his matchup against Daunte Culpepper this week, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners. 

Darrell Jackson <http://f! oo! tball222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/08/01
Jackson is performing in a pivotal AFC West game for the Seahawks this week, but he remains a risk. Matt Hasselbeck hasn't been able to get him the ball on a consistent basis, and the Raiders' secondary is formidable. Only start Jackson if one of your top receivers is injured or has a bye week.

Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Lewis had four receptions for 57 yards last weekend against Arizona, breaking a streak of three subpar games. He remains one of the nest Fantasy tight ends in the league, and is worth starting this week against Minnesota. 

Joey Galloway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Galloway had a big game against the N.Y. Giants last weekend, and he's worth starting this week against Atlanta. The Falcons have the worst defense in the league against the pass, so Galloway has a chance to put up some solid numbers. 

Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Clark has been a respectable Fantasy TE this year, because Brian Griese has made good use of two tight end sets. He is definitely worth starting in an important AFC West game against the Chargers.

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Harris had 49 yards receiving against the N.Y. Giants last weekend, but he's done nothing for Fantasy owners for the most part. Unless Dallas begins to incorporate him into the offense more, Harris isn't worth holding onto. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Ismail has been inconsistent this season, but he may actually be worth starting this week. He'll face an Atlanta secondary ranked last in the league against the pass, so taking a gamble on him in deeper leagues is advisable. 

Dwayne Carswell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1328&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Carswell has been a regular target for Brian Griese this year. he will definitely get some important looks in a divisional matchup with the Chargers.

Thomas Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187390&>, RB ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Jones has only 14 carries in his last three games, and isn'! t ! getting enough playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration. Unless Michael Pittman gets hurt, Jones is worthless to Fantasy owners at this point. 

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/08/01
Smith has three 100-yard games in his last six meetings with the Chargers. Expect another big game from Denver's marquee receiver this week.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/08/01
Plummer continues to be a mediocre Fantasy quarterback, but you may actually want to consider starting him this week against the Giants. He threw for 318 yards and two TDs in his last game against the G-Men, and has five TDs in his last three games against New York overall. 

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Minnis is a risky start at New York. He has the size to challenge the Jets' defense, but lacks the experience needed to test their cornerbacks on a consistent basis.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Sanders has put up some decent numbers over the last two weeks, but he's an unreliable Fantasy player overall. You may want to consider using him in deeper leagues that start three wideouts, however, but he's not worth the gamble outside of those formats. 

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Green should post respectable numbers on the road against the Jets. Successful running from Priest Holmes should set him up for regular downfield passes.

Anthony Becht <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Becht has not been a consistent pass-catching threat this year. Still, he may be open for some TD opportunities against the Chiefs.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/08/01
Chrebet has been a big disappointment this season. He is a risky Fantasy start, even against the vulnerable Chiefs defense.

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/08/01
Hearst bruised his knee during last Sunday's game against Detroit, but he is listed as probable for this weekend's game against New Orleans. Hearst may struggle against the Saints' tough r! un! defense, so consider placing him on reserve if your roster allows it. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/08/01
Coles has become a regular scoring threat for the Jets. He is definitely worth a start against the mediocre Kansas City secondary.

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/08/01
Owens continues to be one of the top wideouts in the league, catching nine passes for 125 yards and two scores against Detroit last week. Owens has had some big games in the past against this week's opponent, New Orleans, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners. 

Curtis Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 11/08/01
Expect another big day from Martin. The Chiefs' defense will have great difficulty stopping the centerpiece of the New York offense.

Vinny Testaverde <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 11/08/01
The Kansas City defense is definitely vulner! ab! le to the pass, but the Jets haven't been throwing the ball enough to please Fantasy leaguers. Don't start Testaverde unless your team is very thin at QB.

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Price has been an up-and-down performer this year. Don't start him unless one of your regulars is on a bye or is injured.

Eric Moulds <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Moulds will engage in a another classic war with CB Ty Law this week. Look for mediocre yardage numbers, but Moulds may catch a TD pass.

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 11/08/01
Johnson won't put up great numbers at New England. The Bills may start to lean on the run more often this week.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Brown should have a good game this week. The Patriots should have little problem throwing the ball at home against Buffalo.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.
