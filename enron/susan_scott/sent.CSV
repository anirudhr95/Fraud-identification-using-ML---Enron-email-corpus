Subject:	Summary of GridFlorida approval





On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO.

Some positive aspects for EPMI:

States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has ""theoretical merit"", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented.
Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval.

"Interview","Kevin,

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  After speaking with everyone Thursday it became obvious to me that there are some real opportunities and room for growth with Cinergy right now.  It was also apparent that it is going to take a good deal of hard work and the ability to tackle many variant tasks to achieve those aims.  To that end, let me reiterate to you my willingness to take on a host of responsibilities to aid in that process.  As I expressed to you at lunch, my goal is to obtain the skills and tools that will make me a consistent and effective trader.  I left the offices Thursday with the impression that Cinergy, and those with whom I interviewed, could help me to accomplish those objectives.  Good luck with the many tasks ahead and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Thank you,
Susan

Subject:	FERC Announces Technical Conference on RTO Seams Coordination

On December 15, 2000, EPSA, ELCON, Enron, Reliant and Dynegy filed a request for FERC to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on interregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8 requirements.  Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, Enron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS Phase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the earlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.

"Spa Schedule","Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)

Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or 
a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light 
misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. 
Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.

Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.

Time: 90 minutes


Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - 
are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute 
message that completes the treatment.

Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.

Time: 90 minutes

Ta Ta,

So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.

Susan,

If you have time at some point today could you stop by my desk. We had
some problems running that GDOPT & SwapAvg Report file last week.


Cheers,

SPR

"RE: Unmapped curves","i'll stop by while making my rounds this afternoon.  and, you'll have to get someone else to tell the stories...i don't remember much of friday night and, as a result, susan had a ""come to Jesus"" meeting with herself this weekend.  may be the last of the truly good stories involving me for a while.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

How do I find out the omicron curves for these curves?  Would George know?

Please see below and note that the following curves do not have any omicron vol curves.  Can you help map these?

Thanks,
Frank

Tried to call you last night but to no avail.  Know that you were out
having fun.  Mom came to San Diego and we took some pix.  Here are a few.
We called Cris and Chuck and sent them an email with  these pictures.
Love, Dad  There is one of me with the Starship in Wichita and the rest are
on us in San Diego.  We walked over to the Fish Market on the bay and ate
there.  It was really nice. We had a table on the water and had a great
meal.

"","well girls,

i didn't end up getting the job with Puget.  i was runner up to a guy with more trading experience.  he hadn't decided whether or not he was going to accept, which is why they were waiting to get back to me.  i called last night due to the decisions i was having to make around here and the VP i met with there subsequently called the guy to get an answer.  unfortunately for me, his answer was, ""yes"".  

anyway, while that opportunity is no longer...i have still decided to decline my offer with UBS to join the reformed trading organization down here.  on that front, i am still very interested in trying to get up to seattle and was wondering if either of you were familiar with some headhunters.  let me know if there are any things in particular you think i should be looking into.

thanks guys,
susan

IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  MONTH & TAG YOU'RE IT! 

[IMAGE]
Well, it is and that  means you and me. I'm supposed to send this to
[IMAGE]
FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures; 
There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and 
only eight who do.  
Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]
If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due 
to  her proportions. 
The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.
[IMAGE]
The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! 
A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent 
looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
[IMAGE]
Today they weigh 23%  less.
[IMAGE]
~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.
[IMAGE]
An English professor  wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. 
The men wrote: ""Woman,  without her man, is nothing."" 
The women wrote: ""Woman! Without her, man is  nothing."" 
The Images of Mother 
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot!
[IMAGE]
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 
14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 
16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 
18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 
25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  
***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in 
celebration of Women's History Month. 
If  you do, something good will happen.... YOU will boost another 
woman's  self-esteem!

Subject:	FERC order denying SPP/Entergy RTO -Summary





FERC Order Issued 3/28/01 Rejecting SPP/Entergy's RTO 

	The Commissioners were generally displeased by SPP and Entergy's lack of substantive work toward complying with the Commission's previous orders and failure to sufficiently discuss the feasibility of a broader RTO.  As Chair Herbert said:  SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).

?	The Commission declined to approve SPP's scope and configuration because the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.

	o	Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.)
	o	Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to SPP.
	o	MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion, will be met.

?	Approves Entergy's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Transco and approves Entergy's Board approval process (states that Entergy would control no more than two of the selection committee's seven members). 

?	Allows Southwestern Public Service Company to satisfy its merger obligation by joining SPP instead of MISO.

?	The Commission did not address EPMI's motion to condition market based rate authority on RTO participation.******

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.

   hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
when
   i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have
info
   on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to
try
   seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
   helpful

   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
   weekend unfortunately....

   i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
   and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
   night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
   do!

   the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
you
   never know.

   my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
   sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
believe
   me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
could
   get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

   ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
   definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
friday.
   the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
anytime
   on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
   message and ill call you back.

   very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

   oh, where are you staying?

   Hi Bonnie,

   How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
have
   been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
riding
   public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
have
   some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
One
   of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
in
   your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
   still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
   like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
   for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

   Thanks a bunch,
   Susan

I absolutely love this quote.  It manages to state, significantly more eloquently than myself, my own personal mantra of the last few years...I want to be pleasantly surprised.  Which is ultimately why I don't see it within my power in the near future to settle.  Maybe years down the road when desperation has set in I'll break down and throw myself at some sub-par individual, but let's hope it never gets to that point or if it does that I'm bordering on senile and just don't know any better.  

Anyway, I'm so glad we got to spend so much time together at Deborah's wedding and I love hanging out with you Mom and Becka (sp?)...they crack me up.  If there's anything I can do to assist you with this wedding, let me know...even if you just need someone to run errands with or support your ideas.  I'd love to get together sometime this week for a drink, coffee, dinner, or whatever if you have any free time.  Maybe Lisa would be available as well?

"RE: yo","Sorry Mo....certainly didn't mean to bum you out.  I'm a torrent of mixed feelings today.  Between job prospects, my cold and coming to grips with some of the past i've just been a little detached from myself.  I was also in the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were IM'ing and it was bringing back stuff too.  I'm just struggling with this pattern of attaching myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotionally not available.  and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very conflicted....b/c to be honest, i really hope he never contacts me again...but i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is something wrong with even our casual interaction (and i'm not disagreeing), which ultimately makes me feel guilty and rotten.  so anyway...i think i just want something to come along that feels good..whether that be a job,a guy,a location, a massage...whatever.  i'm just very disappointed with mediocrity.  i feel luke warm about too many things.  

and the partying comment didn't make me think of us reverting...it merely made me think of mm and a past conversation we had at a point i could have maybe kept things from going too far.  

give me a buzz tonight when you get home...i'll probably feel tons better after a little nourishment.

"","Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

For future reference I would highly recommend calling me on my cell phone (713-775-6472) instead of the apartment phone.  Lisa ALWAYS answers that phone...in fact, she usually doesn't even give me a chance if she's there (who on earth would be calling me?).

We'll keep working on the ""trip"".  I'm sure something wonderful will come up and it will be a fantastic endeavor.

"RE: hey sue...","Hey Lis....

As always it's good to hear from you.  I've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there (although, obviously you are surviving).  Please tell Priya, ""Congratulations!!!!"" for me...that is awesome.  I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc.  I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C. (or Boston or Northern California for that matter).  You should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now...run with it!  And, good luck trying to arrange the trip w/ Niclas.  If you do manage to go...just have fun (it doesn't have to be ""it"", it can just be fun).

I have an offer in KC right now, should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago.  So things are definitely happening.  I'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French (you think I'm kidding, but I've really been checking this stuff out).  

Part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event.  Chris went into premature labor on Tuesday (she was about 6 mos along) and the baby didn't make it.  She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak.  They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes Chuck and Chris told the doctors to let her go.  Her name was Kelly Elizabeth Scott.  My Mom and Chris's Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough.  Chris is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.  So say a little prayer for them if you can.

I miss you too (you were actually in my dream last night) and really hope you're enjoying yourself.  Take care and I'll talk to you soon.

Sue

my visit.  I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but
I've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.
Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure
I've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also make
sure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming 
skirt or dress will work okay? ).

No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple of
weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for
naps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.
Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big  deal.

My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40
Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly as
tired).

Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be more
than ready for a little R&R.

Love,
Susan

Subject:  Hello!


hi susan-

how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a note
before it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a day
off- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed
(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, so
i may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get it
all done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude on
our beach time!

the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming it
will warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitely
bring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....

what are your flight times?

can't wait to see you!
love,
julie

"Re: Nothing bad...","The email was titled ""nothing bad..."" so you wouldn't immediately trash it for fear I was dispensing some more of Susan's homespun wisdom.  I know you can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.  From what I understand you guys are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good work!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you Ted, it's just that no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what you're doing (I haven't heard any of the ""when I grow up I want to be a ....."" comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely loving it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades go into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Rockets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am off to Vegas this weekend to ""meet"" with some of the power traders from Portland.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.

No need to ""let me of the hook"" for my candor last night, I meant everything I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel...always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itself for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always acts on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hearing is starting to go in your old age, but I said ""clod"" not ""god""...subtle but important difference.

Shorty

- You missed an impressive dancing display at Sierra's last night...I think I may have frightened some people.

Why would you have to title an email ""nothing bad..."".  Personally, I was disappointed I wasn't promoted to MD because I have brought in so much revenue for Enron and as we know the entire world revolves around me.  Thanks on the email and how is trading going?  Also, I appreciate your candor last night (you didn't think I would let you off the hook completely did you) and thanks for calling me a god.  It was flattering.

Congrats on the promotion.  I was a little suprised it was only to manager...I remember you saying something once about jumping straight to Director.  All things in due time, right?

you're right, the events of this past week were tough, but on reflection these events have not made me want to crawl in a corner and be afraid- just the opposite - they made me realize that life is fragile and short.  so why not enjoy it in the company of some good friends?

No offense :-)

Subject:	

Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, ""Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like."" And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. ""You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?""

The male statue looked at the female and asked, ""Do you want to do it
again?""
""Oh, yes!"" the female statue said. ""But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!""

Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those
things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you
feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now
barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly)
and have instituted a personal limit for myself.  Hopefully, I'll find
the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will
be able to stick to the new limit.

It was indeed an area bequeathed with natural beauty and with minimal pollution. When the pictures come out I will be sure to let you see them. I arrived back at 2am last night - I actually feel good now, which is rather odd given the general level of exertion the past few days. Yet it had been too long since I sat in front of a fire away from civilization as we know it and passed around a bottle of whiskey. Very therapeutic for the soul. Now it is time for some more Enron therapy once again, for an indefinate period of time... Perhaps you would be interested in going out with Tobin and myself on Thursday to the front porch? That is another form of therapy that I quite enjoy...

Enjoy your day,

Ben

Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Houston the past couple of weekends.  I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.

I have already filled out the form available on eHRonline.com.  If you could either email me with the instructions or call at ext. 31455 I would appreciate it.

Subject:	RE: a little something to think about

I am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with Sam - How is Sam by the way?)  Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading material has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.  However, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interesting.  The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  I know it may sound a little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting.  If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've included here.  There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of reading right now:  Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love and Eleanor of Aquitaine : A Life.  The Galileo book is a little slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does Eleanor of Aquitaine.  If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fondness for history.  I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoyable.  Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniqueness of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to research for the book.
Hope this helps you out a bit.  As for the ""Peacers"" comment...Definitely think we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recognize our own strength and endurance.  Contrary to God not knowing anything about us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique ability to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for life.  It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right?  But, in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we have to offer the people around us for whom we care the most).  Sorry, I know I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of thinking lately - and much of it at church. 
Disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in Austin over the fourth, but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you.  And, I'll keep looking for you name on the Enron Field scoreboard.
Later,
Susan

Sue-
 
In lieu of my attendance in Austin, I want to know if you have any good books for me to read.  I'm gotten a list from Sam and from a friend at school, but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.
 
A theory (for the Prince of Peacers):
 
I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to God.  I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us, or cares for that matter.  I feel that when he gets tired of watching Jerry Springer re-runs, he looks down on our little planet form his lay-z-boy and selects one of us at random, throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we handle it.  Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air their dirty laundry on T.V.  Then again maybe not.
 
I hope all is well.  Glad you like the new job.
 
JON

Subject:	One RTO Entergy to GridSouth

I talked with Rogers, who said that it makes sense for us to advocate one RTO from Entergy through Southern into GridSouth (presumably getting TVA to commit at some point to an RTO).  Florida should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Midwest.  Therefore, the overall theme that Jim discussed this morning (that FERC has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Tom C. is getting the draft of this.)  Thanks.

Nick emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up.  When he finally did call I knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call, the engagement is OFF.  They evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came Friday night.  To top everything off, he's moving back to Houston in three weeks...ughh.  Obviously, given my last conversation with him in London, I'm a little concerned.  Oh well, who wants a non-stressful existence anyway.

Ta for now,
Sue

"Re: Hey buddy...","Just heard from the Earl...he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks.  I encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch, as he seems receptive to interaction at this point.  

As for last Wednesday, we had actually moved on to Steak Night by 9:30 and then were off to Sierra's.  Needless to say it was a big night.  

Glad to hear the game was good and I'm not suprised in the least that you have ""get-up-and-go"" (I've seen you when an attractive woman passes by).

I'm a no go for Thursday as I've actually already made dinner plans with a friend.  Besides, Dean's is the ex's favorite Thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine.  I'm sure after this response Ben will be convinced I'm avoiding him, but I assure you that is not the case.

Cheers

I should be in town this weekend if anything is going on...

Oh I am so glad to hear from you! How are things? Been thinking about you---no not in that way. :)
No, actually, Daniel and I got back around 9:30 and I went into Farrago's to see if you were there....but you weren't. I looked like death warmed over after the game...it has been way too long since my playing days. To be true, I have the get-up-and-go, but I literally whiffed a few kicks...
Thankfully, Daniel played well. He had one pitch that was sweet!!
What are you up to this week? I am trying to get Ben to go with me to Dean's on Thursday. I love that place on Thursdays....wait, I digress...I like the ladies on Thursdays there. Want to go?
Let me know what the Earl says...I am a little disappointed in him as of late...not that he cares.....

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.

Subject:	labor day

hi susan-  sorry i missed your call on sunday!  i was totally hung over and
lying on the beach, and my cell phone doesn't always get reception
there.  labor day definitely works for me- call me if you want to today to
discuss, or we can email and work everything out that way.  i have no plans
as of now, so whatever works for you, works for me!  i can take off friday,
if necessary, or you can fly in friday afternoon or friday evening and we
can have all day friday, saturday, and most of sunday.

hope you had a fun weekend- can't wait to see you again!

julie

"Re: damn!","We know about Merle...don't know if I'll be able to go though b/c I have to be in San Antonio at a bridal luncheon by 12:30 on Friday.  There's no reserved seating anyway so I think I might be a bit of a mess (remember how crowded the Bellamy Brothers were?)

As for the trip over...I'm arriving on the 6th ( Wednesday morning at 7:45) and I'll be leaving the morning of the 12th.  Not perfect, but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know.  I'll have a total of 6 full days over there.  Plenty of time to do something interesting right?

Sue

I'm not going to tell Lisa for a little while, so mum's the word....hopefully she'll already have booked her own flight.

"RE: How are you?","This whole experience must be too much fun for you...getting to work with all these young pilots (any of them single?) and strutting your stuff.  

The trip to Park City was fantastic.  We had some really good meals and managed two solid days of skiing.  It dumped 2 feet of snow Sunday night so we had tons of powder on Monday to ski through...and to cushion our falls.  Tuesday was absolutely beautiful, sunny but still below freezing.  The views from a few of the runs at the top of the mountain were breath-taking.  Monique took all the pictures on her digital camera, so as soon as she uploads them I'll be able to check them out and order a few.  This is my first day back at work this week and it looks as though they're moving me to another floor pretty soon...too much sensitive information up here I suppose.  It's fine though because there are a few others from the trading group who declined the UBS offer and will be housed on the other floor as well, so I will have company.  I've got a couple other leads to try and track on the job front...another company in Seattle and one in Richmond, VA that my old trader Larry told me about.  I'm still glad I made the decision I did and am excited to see where that choice ultimately leads me.  Even Tobin (from my first group here at Enron) is trying to help my find something in the Pacific Northwest.  I'm really curious to see what he may come up with since his acquaintances run the gamut in terms of interests and occupations.  

Glad to hear you're having a good time and helping out in the ""effort"", and I'll talk to you soon.

Love, 
Subaru

Suz, I'm using both addresses since I don't know which one is current.
Guess that you had a good time at Monique's and did a little skiing.  Hope
that work is going as well as it can under the circumstances.  We are
flying and having a good time out here.  It's fun to work with the Navy
again.  This time it is the carrier  Abraham Lincoln and her battle group.
 mostly we make attacks on her and fighters like F-14s and F-18's come up
and intercept us.  We are carrying electronic pods which jam and deceive
their radars and everybody gets some good training.  Yesterday I just got
out to the area which is south of San Clemente island off the coast of
Southern California and had a generator failure.  I was with another A-4
and he continued the mission.  I went back to Pt.Mugu and jumped into
another airplane and got back out for the second and third runs.  The whole
thing just about wore me out but it felt good to get the mission
accomplished.  Love, Dad

"Re: Hello!","Hi yourself,

I swear you read my mind sometimes...I was just about to email you.  Anyway, things here are good and I am equally (if not more) excited about my visit.  I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but I've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.  Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure I've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also make sure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming a skirt or dress will work okay? ).

No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple of weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for naps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.  Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big deal.

My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40 Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly as tired).

Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be more than ready for a little R&R.

Love,
Susan

hi susan-

how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a note
before it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a day
off- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed
(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, so
i may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get it
all done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude on
our beach time!

the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming it
will warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitely
bring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....

what are your flight times?

can't wait to see you!
love,
julie

"Whistler","Hey Bonnie,

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

"RE: change of address","hey...

i actually just filled my change of address form out this morning...i figured you'd already done yours.  i'm leaving for the airport straight from work tonight and don't get back until sunday night.  i can fill it out monday, but if you would like it done before then you may want to try and tap someone else for the job.

the reason monday is important is b/c someone wants to rent our place and i've told the complex that i'll be completely out by the end of the day monday.  so starting monday night i'm back in northwest houston and w/out a mail key.  on the bright side, i'm getting a fair amount of money back from the january rent (which means we're cool rent wise, i.e. you needn't give me any $ for january).  

i do have an interview in seattle tomorrow morning...i'm nervous and excited.  i've been studying a bunch for the last week and a half or so to try and prep myself.  i think i'm more nervous about not liking the job rather that liking it or not doing well in the interview.  also, i'm going to see ""kiss me kate"" the musical w/ my friend up there so that should be fun.

i'm glad to hear that things seem to be going so well for you there, you sound awfully busy.  keep us posted on all your many activities.

Subject:	12th Friday State of the Union

Well its been a very long time.  A lot has transpired since my last ever-popular Friday State of the Union.  As usual my friends and I have been up to no good and, fortunately for you, I am ready and willing to tell you all about it. There are so many people and things to talk about and only one State of the Union to cover it all.  This could be a very rough ride so, as always, Brace Yourself!!!

Multiple choice question:  Which one of the these airport names does not belong? A) Reagan International Airport  B) Bush Intercontinental Airport C) JFK Airport D) Louis Armstrong National Airport.  Well in case you are stumped, here is a little hint: think ""Satchmo.""  Chris Coulon (my political insider) told me that the city of New Orleans had narrowed it down to two choices: Edwin Edwards National Airport or Louis Armstrong National Airport.  Well it was a close race but considering Edwin Edwards was convicted last year of numerous counts of bribery and extortion; the City of New Orleans decided on Louis Armstrong.  So now every time you fly into ""Satchmo"" make sure you high-five a friend as you pass that beautiful picture of Chris Owens and her 60-year old breasts because you are now in New Orleans, a place where absolutely nothing gets taken serious.

Speaking of New Orleans, has anyone read the book Confederacy of Dunces?  Now that he lives in the French Quarter, Granola Centola truly personifies the book's main character, Ignatius Reilly.  Just last weekend, while walking back to his apartment from Cat's Meow, Larry felt the need to relieve himself next to a neighbor's car(what a way to build neighborhood friendships!).  While in ""mid-stream,"" Larry got picked up by a policeman and dragged off to the Orleans Parish Prison (OPP) for indecent exposure and public drunkenness.  When I asked Larry what it was like to spend the night in the ""Black Bar Hotel"" his response was, ""It wasn't that bad I talked politics the whole night with my cell-mates,"" and he added, ""the best thing was that they (cell-mates) were all Democrats.  Can you believe it?""  Yes, Larry, we can believe that all your cell-mates were Democrats. 

Well if you haven't already heard Shawn (The Wop) has moved back into Beau Chene College Apartments.  This move has made Shawn a target for jokes amongst most of our friends.  Thankfully, Shawn takes these comments with a grain of salt and even recently commented to me that ""I (Shawn) love living in Beau Chene, especially since I have been included in Jeff Jordan's (Landlord's) Monday Night Football parties.""  Shawn says there is only two requirements to get into this party: 1) you must be a guy and 2) you must B.Y.O.C (Bring Your Own Cold Cuts).  Shawn says that no one seems to like his ham or turkey and that for some reason there tends to be an enormous amount of Salami at these parties.  Shawn says it never fails, whenever Jeff introduces him as an old FIJI  to someone at the party, the first question is always ""Do you know Nick Nesbit and the Turner Twins?"" and the second question is ""Do you like Salami?""  Word to the wise, Shawn, you might want to rethink the meaning of the ""C"" part  in B.Y.O.C.

While most of Houston wants the 2012 Summer Olympics in Houston so they can watch the events, the girl I went on a date with a few weeks ago wants it to come here so she can compete in the Track and Field Events.  Now I am not insecure about my manliness, nor do I consider myself out of shape, but after having dinner with the ""she hulk"" I felt pretty damn wimpy.  Thankfully, I had my good buddy Lenhart to pick me up from my deep depression.  We went out the following Thursday night to Houston's Latest Hot Spot, TACO MILAGRO.  Since Matt had  a very bad case of Laryngitis, we worked as a team; I talked to all of the girls and Matt just stood there and smiled.  Oddly enough, we got a ton of girls' phone numbers.  Matt couldn't understand it and even boasted about it the next day, ""I (Matt) was on fire last night.  I didn't even say one word the whole night and for some reason I got more phone numbers than ever before!""  Overhearing our conversation, Tim (Paw-Paw) Blanchard chimed in, ""It is not a coincidence, dude.""

Speaking of Paw-Paw, next Friday Night is Tim's Bachelor Party in Baton Rouge.  As most of you already know, Tim does not have a spontaneous bone in his body, so he took the liberty of e-mailing us his itinerary (See Below!) for next Friday night's ""Festivities."" 

1) 7:37 PM - Kiss Louise goodbye.
2) 8:43 PM - Drink 2.32 beers with everyone at the Sheraton Hotel in Downtown Baton Rouge.
3)10:26 PM - Drink 3.7 beers at the Gold Club and tell Landry how I (Tim) am not like Lenhart ""I (Tim) don't like to get drunk and pick up chicks while hanging out at the Club."" (Note: In case you guys forgot Tim used to be a real partier.  That's how he got the name Paw-Paw...)
4)11:47 PM - Watch Larry pass out at Fred's while dancing to Blind Melon as he proceeds to get into fight with the bouncer.
5)12:56 AM  -  Do one shot with friends and throw the other two shots on the ground when no one else is looking. (Note:  I've actually busted Tim using this tactic on several occasions)
6) 1:50 AM -  Request ""Son of a Preacher Man"" at Fred's and look for the closest Phi-Mu to slow dance with to the song.
7) 2:39 AM -  Bail-out a half drunk Granola Centola from Jail and when he walks out say, ""Larry, what the f-ck!?!""
8) 3:27 AM - Kiss Louise good night and dream about the Tigers kicking the hell out of Auburn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everyone have a Good Weekend!

GEAUX TIGERS!

CKL

"RE: trip to Tennessee","Hey,

The trip to Nashville was good...Chuck and Chris actually live in Clarksville (which is about 45 mins NW of Nashville).  We went out to dinner in Nashville both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday.  Chuck drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live.  We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Cheekwood...it's the estate of the Maxwell Coffee fortune.  Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing.  They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land.

I haven't made a decision about the Seattle job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer.  In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there.  At this point there is really no telling where in the U.S. I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun.

We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).  I just deposited the check so all I need to do is drop off a check for $175 to your Mom...which I will do this weekend.

Hope things are still going well there!

Keep me posted,
Sue

"Visit","Julie,

I just wanted to write and thank you again for affording me the opportunity to visit with you and all the other members of the  Puget trading team.  It was unfortunate we were unable to meet again before my departure so that I could have expressed the above in person, but email will have to suffice.  I very much enjoyed meeting with John, Mark, Dana and yourself, as well as with the other members of the gas and power staff.  You have a unique operation and one which appears to have many untapped opportunities that will undoubtedly make your time with the company fairly interesting for the foreseeable future.  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and look forward to speaking with you again in the future.

I went ahead and mailed all of my travel information, including receipts, to Jaquelyn Lewis as see was mentioned as the travel contact in one of your previous emails.  If there are any other measures I need to take on that front please let me know.

My previous difficulties with my other email service have been resolved.  Therefore, all of my future contact will most likely be through that email address.  In light of this, I simply ask that you direct any future email correspondence to: 

susan_m_scott@hotmail.com 

Once again thank you,
Susan Scott

I just wanted to follow up with you and see if you had a chance to look over my resume.  I realize I may not be exactly the candidate you had in mind when you first spoke with Larry, but I would very much appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss any opportunities you may have available at this point.  As Larry can attest to, I've had responsibilities at Enron that span from back office to trading.  To that extent, I believe I could prove to be a valuable asset within any organization.

Thank you,

JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement

If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  

My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  

Thanks,

option if there's enough interest.  just hoping will not have to be watching

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

you can be available for interviews on 3/4/02.  We then will fly you home
later that day.  Would this work for you?

Sincerely,
Jacquelyn

"Missed call","Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Houston the past couple of weekends.  I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.

Susan,

I contacted Jeremy and Nilay. They did not think that the gas curve relationship data was contained in ERMS, but they referred to me Ganapathy Ramesh who is familiar with RiskTrack. I am waiting for him to return my call.

These individuals may now be with UBS, but they should know who to contact on the estate side.

How do you determine which Omicron curve to use for the curves that don't have one?

I know ... I'm slow.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

"RE: a little something to think about","I am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with Sam - How is Sam by the way?)  Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading material has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.  However, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interesting.  The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  I know it may sound a little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting.  If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've included here.  There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of reading right now:  Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love and Eleanor of Aquitaine : A Life.  The Galileo book is a little slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does Eleanor of Aquitaine.  If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fondness for history.  I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoyable.  Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniqueness of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to research for the book.
Hope this helps you out a bit.  As for the ""Peacers"" comment...Definitely think we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recognize our own strength and endurance.  Contrary to God not knowing anything about us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique ability to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for life.  It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right?  But, in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we have to offer the people around us for whom we care the most).  Sorry, I know I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of thinking lately - and much of it at church. 
Disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in Austin over the fourth, but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you.  And, I'll keep looking for you name on the Enron Field scoreboard.
Later,
Susan

Sue-
 
In lieu of my attendance in Austin, I want to know if you have any good books for me to read.  I'm gotten a list from Sam and from a friend at school, but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.
 
A theory (for the Prince of Peacers):
 
I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to God.  I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us, or cares for that matter.  I feel that when he gets tired of watching Jerry Springer re-runs, he looks down on our little planet form his lay-z-boy and selects one of us at random, throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we handle it.  Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air their dirty laundry on T.V.  Then again maybe not.
 
I hope all is well.  Glad you like the new job.
 
JON

I want to go, but I am just giving myself an out because I sort of feel like curling up in my bed with a tub of ice cream and a movie.

Subject:	more seattle advice

hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.  when
i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have info
on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to try
seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
helpful

i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
weekend unfortunately....

i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
do!

the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle you
never know.

my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night- believe
me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could
get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday.
the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me anytime
on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
message and ill call you back.

very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

oh, where are you staying?

Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have
been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding
public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have
some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One
of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday.  I will ask though.  You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and leaving Korea on Sunday).  The total air fare should be $962.  Shoot me a quick e mail if this is not ok.  Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing your tickets this afternoon.  Thanks!

Nice to hear from you.  I know you just talked to Lisa the other day so I got a little more detailed update from her.  I'm sure she told you about our trip over to London...we had a really good time which included me spending a small fortune.  Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?  Anyway, sounds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over the next 6 mos to a year.  Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it arrives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and Mike are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe.  I wish I was planning the same kind of trip right now.  As for your future beyond that, have you been to Seattle before?  I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any advice.  Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit.  Hope things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together when you come back to Texas...

Hi girls!!
Just thought I would send out an email to see how things are going in the
exciting state of Texas!!  I miss it there and I miss y'all as well...I
already sent Emily an email earlier so that is why she is not included in
this...Sorry about the group email but I thought it might be a little easier
considering I would probably be writing the same thing to everyone....Life
is good here in Boulder....Robert and I are trying to make the most out of
our last months here....We absolutely love Boulder...He graduates in
December and I am leaving in August!  I love the summers here, it seems as
though the town empties out when all the college kids leave!  My plans for
the future are slowly coming together...I will be going to Dallas for the
month of August to be with Karin for the birth of the baby!! August is a
huge month for my family....Mike graduates from college (who would have
thought!), Karin has her baby, Mike and I head off to Europe, and my parents
are moving into their new home...Elaina and I's parents are moving into the
same neighborhood only blocks away from eachother...Mike and I are traveling
Europe for a few months together in which I am hoping to meet up with
Emily...We fly into London which gives her no reason not to meet up!!  After
that, who knows....maybe Seattle or back to Colorado...we have no idea....I
hope everyone was safe from the flooding recently....I know that Adam's
(Wolters) home was flooded again so I think they are just gonna sell the
house....Elaina- how is married life and school?  Laura- I am so excited
about you wedding plans.  How is that coming?   I hope this email finds
everyone healthy and happy...You all cross my thoughts often...I miss
y'all....Keep in touch!
Love,
Sarah

Subject:	Re: Nothing bad...   

The email was titled ""nothing bad..."" so you wouldn't immediately trash it for fear I was dispensing some more of Susan's homespun wisdom.  I know you can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.  From what I understand you guys are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good work!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you Ted, it's just that no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what you're doing (I haven't heard any of the ""when I grow up I want to be a ....."" comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely loving it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades go into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Rockets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am off to Vegas this weekend to ""meet"" with some of the power traders from Portland.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.

No need to ""let me of the hook"" for my candor last night, I meant everything I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel...always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itself for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always acts on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hearing is starting to go in your old age, but I said ""clod"" not ""god""...subtle but important difference.

Shorty

- You missed an impressive dancing display at Sierra's last night...I think I may have frightened some people.

Ed,

To recover email, the person will need to submit a request to Roberto DeLeon in IT Security.  It will probably require the approval of that persons supervisor, Phillip Allen in this case.  I believe the access will be temporary, and it may be monitored.

Keith should be able to work through this process directly with Roberto.

Thanks, d.n.

Subject:	Curve Validation



Ed, I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand with regards to the curve validation project.

Project Progress:

John McKay and Sandra Brawner have completed validating the curves for the east.  PWC has a programmer who is working with Brad and me to see if he can upload the quotes from the electronic quotes we received as well as the reshaped curves that John and Sandra have prepared.

Joe and Troy have just about completed entering the quotes for Permian, Ship Channel, and Waha for the Texas desk.  However, they still need to shape and validate the curves.  

Denver and Kevin have begun working on entering the quotes for the central desk.

On the west we ran into a problem with retrieving the quotes.  Apparently Keith Holst had all the quotes electronically in his email.  However, when the Netco people were converting over to UBS, Enron's IT people destroyed all email that was sitting in the inboxes of these employees.  I've already checked with IT and they have assured me that there is no way to recover that data.  Susan has been working with Keith to see if he had sent any of these emails to others or saved them on his hard drive and thus, she has been able to recover at least part of the days.  Currently, we have quotes for Dec. 12 - 21 and Dec. 31 - Jan. 8.  All other days we are still missing data on.  This process took most of today and Susan will begin working on the quotes that she currently has tomorrow.  



Personnel Issues:

John Arnold was suppose to be back in the office today.  When he did not show, another call was put into him today.  I have not heard back on the status, but will check in the morning.

Both Russell Murrell and Martin Cuilla are suppose to be in tomorrow.

Khymberly has assured me that there isn't much likelihood of Jim Schwieger coming in at all.

Karen Scott needs to take this Friday off.  She had already booked a flight and was to have a long weekend with family.

Kevin Ruscitti will be taking off all of next week.  He and his wife had booked a trip to Mexico some time ago and he feels that this may be the only vacation he gets this year.  He has assured me that he will be here the rest of this week and the last week of February to help in whatever way he can.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kathy

so i've given everyone the heads up around here regarding my decision, and surprisingly enough they have been on the whole very supportive.  Frank told me this was a ""good thing"" for me and that he was jealous.  And Steve actually said he was proud of me.  anyway, it's gone much better than i had expected.  still don't know exactly what happens to me now.  so we shall see what the next weeks hold in store.  

i'm still checking into lodging etc. for this weekend/early next week.  i can fly in saturday or sunday, but maybe sunday morning would be best.  i figure we could touch base and plan the next couple days (plus, i wouldn't have kept you up all night chatting saturday night so that you're exhausted for work sunday).  then we'd have all day monday and tuesday and i'd probably fly back on wednesday....just a thought, feel free to share you own.

Yes, I am still coming over there.  I get into London on the 6th of June and fly out on the 12th.  Please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time.

Hi Ashley,

A friend of mine forwarded this email over to me indicating that your were
in
search of a roommate.  I work for Enron and will be relocating to London
this
July.   I'm not sure if you are still looking for a roommate, but if you
are
still interested I'd like to talk to you.  Enron is located in Central
London,
as you may already know, so the mentioned apartment would be an ideal
location.
Please email me back if you are still looking and perhaps we can further
discuss.

Thanks for your time,
Millie Gautam

From: Ashley.Marynick@chase.com [mailto:Ashley.Marynick@chase.com]


I am looking for a female to share a 2 bedroom flat in Central London.  The
rent is



?380 per week total.  It is an extremely nice 2nd story gated flat
which gets great sun and is located just to the side of the National
Gallery.

You have your choice of Leicester Square, Charing Cross, Embankment, or
Piccadilly Tube stops.  Each is within 1/4 mile of the flat.  It is a 15
minute bus ride to the City which includes time spent waiting for the bus!

I am looking for someone to move in August or September and stay at least
through the end of June.

If you have any questions please call Ashley at 0788-418-5453 (mobile).
Please forward this to anyone you feel might be interested.

Thank you,
Ashley Marynick

As for Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.  So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different weekend.  Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what other dates in September look good to you.

Hi, Susan:

You look quite different now after leaving Risk for four months because a trader's life is less stressful than that of a book administrator (kidding!). 

A question.  I forgot which liquidation number should we use for Gas Daily P&L: P&L post ID or Official Position Post ID.  Could you recall for me?

Wish you all the best!

Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in EPMI.  This details out verious aspects of the Texas retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Texas market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for EPMI to enter the Texas Retail market by January 1, 2002.

	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)

3)  I have attached a copy of a Texas Market Analysis that I prepared for EES.  The general rules are identical for each TDSP service territory.  This provides details of the implementation requirements.
 << File: AEP - Texas Executive Market Summary.doc >> 
4)  EDI Implementation Guides (Version 1.4) to support the Texas Market Opening January 1, 2002, have just been released.  This Version will be the basis for Flight 1001 testing.

The website where all of this information can be reviewed is http://itpta.intellimark-it.com/.  Attached is the Testing Signoff Worksheet that must be completed prior to beginning the testing process.  Tentative key testing dates for Flight 1001 (the last testing flight for January 1, 2002 market opening) are:

Subject:	more seattle advice

hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.  when
i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have info
on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to try
seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
helpful

i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
weekend unfortunately....

i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
do!

the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle you
never know.

my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night- believe
me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could
get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday.
the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me anytime
on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
message and ill call you back.

very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

oh, where are you staying?

Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have
been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding
public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have
some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One
of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

"RE:","Hey Corey,

Was wondering if you and Doug still had any interest in the Concert Sat. night.  Drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets (they're $15 a piece).  The box office opens at 8:00 and doors open at 9:00, but the last time I went there there was a line to get in by 8:45...I would recommend showing up around 8:15 or so to make sure you get a seat inside.  Still trying to figure out how guilty I'd feel missing this bachelorette party...

Subject:	ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES DEAL

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice ""retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction.""

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.

I just got a call from Susan Ginsberg at El Paso.  It seems they have heard from FERC staff that INGAA is showing up an awful lot to talk about the marketing affiliate rule and why there should not be any changes, but they wonder why, if they really are separate companies, the affiliates have not been in to talk to FERC themselves.  I think we have already heard this message, but El Paso wants to set up a group to go into FERC.  THey are setting up a conference call for next Thur with some other companies to discuss this issue.  I told them we would be in on the call (we don't have to, tho) but that we may not want to go into FERC with that group.  

Would anyone like to be on the call next week, or have any problem with my participation in the call?  Shall we talk about going to FERC to give them our position?  (or should we just tell them to read our comments)

Mitch is the guy she's been seeing for about a month now.  He came over last night to watch the Oscar's with us.  Me in a wing-back and Lisa and Mitch holding hands, rubbing arms etc., on the couch.  This is the second time I can recall since being in the apartment with her that I've had to witness the ""cuddle fest.""  Not to mention the ""cuddle fest"" we all witnessed with Chad at Europa.  Maybe if she does come over you could be the little red devil on her shoulder encouraging her to hook up with Nik...force her to make some sort of decision about all these guys.  She's in heat right now I swear.  Every 5 sec. there's some new guy she thinks is hot.  The guy serving us at Jason's Deli might be the next victim.  She's totally out of control.  I must say I loved the way she casually suggested the Nik probably wasn't your type anyway...covering all the bases.  It's really pitiful you know...I'm just glad we will never have the same taste in men.  Did I mention that Laura White's fiancee asked Laura what was going on with Mitch and I at Kenneally's b/c I was spending more time with him than Lisa (she was of course performing the role of social butterfly).  Like I said, it's pitiful.  In actuality, I think I'm the only one of her ""friends"" that have met Mitch and think he's all right  I'm pretty sure everyone else has told her they think she can do better.  I beg to differ, knowing Lisa a little better than them (i.e. the many faces of eve) and would argue instead that he's a pretty good catch for her...caves eventually but not perceived (at least by her) as a complete push-over.  Perfect combo for our Ms. Gillette.

Can you believe my parents?  They were only in San Diego for all of 12 hrs and took a roll of film...what dorks.

I'll work on the trip thing...the timing sounds good to me.

KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER!  com'on.....realllly!  one
would think this email was to organize a trip to london- but nooooo...it's a
""hands off"" warning instead.  and admittedly, the bit about ""trusting me to
honor"" pulls at me and w/ anyone else, i'd snap into good behavior mode, but
then i step bk and realize how sneaky and evil (hel-lo?  who is mitch?  does
she have dibs on him as well?  how many 'dibs' are we allocated?  let me
know when you get the scoop...)what nerve!  as for the 1 line about coming
to london, katy isn't coming mid may- she's coming at the end-begin. of
june, which is much better for me, too- have school full-time til last week
of may....so, i vote you send her mid may, then come w/ kates at the end of
the month.  and, gee- do tyou think i can predict her visit?  let's see-
it'll be convenient and cheap to stay w/ me....but- perfect timing for her
to show up at my doorstep, get her extra key, then jaunt off to 'secure' her
position w/ mr.dibs....not that i'm complaining- just horribly offended that
she thinks i'm so dense as to not be able to see- and hear- her large, slow,
unoiled wheels a-turning....!  aughhhhh!  see below, obviously....

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

"RE: Kelly's Bachelorette Party","back to reality with a vengeance, sometimes reality is no fun...I think the weekend in NB will prove beneficial for you as well so enjoy.  I'm guessing I'll end up at the party despite wanting to go to that concert at the Fabulous Satellite Lounge (I hate having a conscience!)  .

no contact with the guy...although i think he went home mid-week for a friend's wedding...regardless, though it may not sound like it, i haven't been too focused on the situation.  on a another ""playing with fire"" note, went and grabbed a couple pints wednesday with dutch (the old boss) and ended up eating dinner with him as well.  he paid (although he tricked me into letting him, said he was charging it to the company so i'd put my money away...needless to say he didn't expense it).  we've always been friends so i guess one outing doesn't hurt, but any future encounters may have to include others for safety reasons.

i'll see you when you get home.

Hello Susan -

This is Bobby here at Enron. I work in retail power in EES.

We met  ages ago here in Houston.
I started working here at Enron a month ago.

I work on 6 but make it to 31 and 32 from time to time to talk to people there.

Hope things are good on your end.

"RE:","Em,

Glad you had such a good time...sounds like Norm may have even had a little bit of fun?  Anyway, must agree on the ex-fianc? front ( I am understandably nervous about said individual's return to Houston ).  Have to agree on the German beer/food front as well.  I loved everything about that country while I was there, especially the people.  They were all so jolly and round.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Had another pledge sister's wedding this weekend, Deborah Vest, and it was beautiful of course.  Happened to run into Doug George, a.k.a Big Ken, and he said to say, ""hello"".  He's living in Austin these days and is planning on going to grad school in a year and a half or so (though hasn't applied yet).  He said he saw T.L. recently in Dallas and Taylor has gained about 40 lbs, gone off his rocker, and is dating a girl who used to have purple hair...all sufficiently disturbing news.  Anyway, maybe we'll be able to get in touch with Doug if we end up going to Austin while you're in town.

In some cases, EPSA cannot file (for example, when the members cannot agree), then Enron would file if it is an important issue to us.

For this call, Ray, you may want to be on the call since EPSA is going to file re: Cal. order.

Susan--Sarah Novosel will probably be on the call for the NY issue and Tom Hoatson is attending the workshop on capacity.  Therefore, typically, you wouldn't  need to be on this call, but I think you should listen in to learn.  (I will get you on the EPSA distribution.)

Tom--you may want to listen in to the capacity workshop discussion.

Donna --Discussion of Alliance.

Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta

My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.

"Long time, no talk....","Hey guys,

Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life.  If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days.  I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous).  I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea.  

As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in Houston.  I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough.  The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays.  Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat.  It was a completely surreal experience.  Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing.

Speaking of the new job, things are going well.  I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come.  There is just an overwhelming amount of information, not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US.  I've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade.  So far so good though...I'm definitely glad I made the choice to stay in Houston and take on this role.

I had a pledge sister's wedding in San Antonio a few weeks ago, which was fun, and another ""sister's"" wedding this weekend here in Houston.  I tell you, it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements.  Two weekends ago I got hit with 3, yes you heard correctly 3, new engagements of close friends.  I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front.  Still, the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one, aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course, is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself.  I just have the feeling I've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two (or more) and am not sure that what I'd want now is what I'll want then.  Okay, change of subject...getting to deep.

Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas.  We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun.  Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun.  I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6:30 am.  I don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks, but you really do lose all track of time there.  I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover.  I managed to walk away only $40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good.

What the future holds? - I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit Emily and then she comes back to Houston for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that.  And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts.  September is also an option if that works better for you.  I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends.  Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase.

Hope the trip was a rousing success and I'll talk to you soon,
Sue

"Re: Random","Hi Ashley,

It's so funny that you emailed me today because I was just telling Jessica this weekend that I needed to drop you a line.  Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.  I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.  However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.  I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.

Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.  I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).  I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.  Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together. 

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Susan,

I know this is a bit random, but I know that you had maybe mentioned coming
over to London for a year.  I have no idea if this will pan out, but I am
looking for a roommate.  If you were comign over and might want to be my
roommate, I would be super excited.  I live in a really cool area in teh
middle of everything and do not want to have to give up the flat.  It is
actually really cheap rent at ?200 a week or so.  the little man who owns
it lives next door and keeps different flowers planted depending on the
season.

If you are not coming, or just do not want to be my roommate, do  you think
you could keep your ears open for anyone you know who might be moving over.
Do you think your friend who you were visiting might need a roommate?

Think on it and let me know any feedback.
Take care,
Ashley

"visit","Sorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and subsequently exhausted on Sunday.  I basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed.  Pitiful but much needed.  Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.  Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday.  You can either call or email if you have any questions for me.  And, I'll decide where I'd like to go for the long weekend.  I may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination.

Good to hear from you.

Can't say I have too much scoop on Reliant.  Although, I do know a couple of people who work and have worked there and I'd be happy to put you into contact with them if you'd like.

I'd love to get together while you're in town.  Tomorrow night's probably best for me so either give me a call at work or on my cell phone when you get a chance.

Ciao,

Hello Susan,

I hope that you are doing well and looking forward to the weekend!  I am
actually going to be in town, so perhaps we can all get together one night.
What is your schedule?  It's been too long.  Black Swan....???

I have an interview tomorrow with Reliant Resources and wanted to know if
you knew anything about them...being in the trading industry yourself.  The
inside scoop would be great!

I'm flying out tonight, but can always be reached on my cell at (713)

Take care,
Mary Rebecca

"RE:","I heard someone pulled a hamstring trying to be butch w/ the military workouts....

As for me, the trip was fantastic.  Mucho shopping and even more eating.  Not to mention the weather was beautiful and you could actually walk everywhere you wanted to go.  The plane flight back was definitely not fun, but I did survive.  It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder.  I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.  It has a definite Austin vibe.  The people are extremely friendly, seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do.  Oh well,  I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits.

Bobby/Matt,

I spoke with Mike yesterday and he filled me in on his correspondence with both of you.  I appreciate your assistance in identifying potential opportunities for me in Portland.  

John and I are planning a relocation in the near future and I have always had an interest in the Portland office.  Still, this is a fairly involved decision for us and at present we are discussing a number of  options.  Therefore, while I am preparing my resume to forward to your HR rep, I would appreciate it if you could hold off on speaking with Tim for a few days.  That should give me enough time to work through a few of the options with John.  Thanks again for your help.

Mo.

"Sante Fe","Hey girls, 

Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

"This Weekend...","Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:

I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).

The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.

Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.

Sue

PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.

I'll have to give you a call at home some time so we can really talk.  As for a visit, you know I'm always up for a trip out to the coast.  I'm actually heading to Seattle next weekend with a friend from work and then August is going to be filled with a trip to Denver (work related...I know tough) and a visit to S. Korea to see Chris and Chuck for a week and a half or so.  I'm really excited about that trip...I think we're going to try and take a weekend jaunt somewhere like Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing while I'm there.  So given all of that, what are your thoughts on Labor day weekend?  It's the first weekend of September...automatic 3 day weekend for me, so I could fly in around the same time I did on my last visit that Friday and leave Monday afternoon.  Let me know if that sounds good, or if there's some other weekend you had in mind.  

You'll have to tell both of the Eric's and Clint I said, ""Hello.""  I had such a great time hanging out with all of them, and your cousin too.  You attract very fun and interesting people...it's a credit to your excellent company.  By the way, how are things in regards to Clint...still just good hang-out buddies?  I'm assuming, since you didn't say anything in your email that things with Brendan are still good and if so, I'm glad for you.  

I went shopping at Stein Mart recently too and found some really cute things, I absolutely love that store.  And, I'm honored to be your shopping muse.

Hi Larry,

Just wanted to see how you're doing these days.  I'm glad to hear things are finally up and running and that you all have stuff to do now.  I'm with the rest of the lepers down on the fourth floor these days.  We'll have to round up a group to grab a drink after work sometime.

Susan

See, I've already come up with a reason why I have to come back out there.  Please don't worry about flapping Sat night.  I certainly do not think less of you and completely agree about the life lessons part.  To tell the truth, I worry at times that I'm not learning enough of the life lessons...just kind of staying in a very safe, secure place and missing out on a big part of the overall picture.

how fun- i totally forgot that you're off to vegas this weekend!  thanks for the input about clint- you're right, and i hadn't realized that i fit his ""type"" until he defined it.   now i know why he's so nice to me!  he does know about brendan, of course, but since i don't always behave like i have a boyfriend it's easy for guys to not take him too seriously.....not good.  i'm also embarrassed that i flapped away in the car on saturday night- hope you don't think horrible things about me.  although it's okay if you do- i think horrible things about myself every now and then! but i always attribute it to the lessons of life.....i'm curious about your work situations- you've never mentioned them.  that is truly uncomfortable and i have not had to deal with that here.....

keep me posted on your exciting life!  otherwise, i'm doing the right thing to not contact eric, right?  so silly for me to ask, but i like being friends with him (probably the flirting is fun), but it's a dead end.....

I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory.  The
retaliation/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be
tempting.  My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any
representative of Ted's sex like dirt.  Fortunately, my behavior was very
short-lived and I completely recognized what I was doing.  I wouldn't worry
about the lecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just
utter flapping as in my case).

Thanks for the compliments, but I find it's easy to be around all of your
friends...that whole like attracts like thing.  As for the email from
Clint, he's a cutie.  Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were
you though...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, but I get
the impression that you're just Clint's type and unless you have reciprocal
interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.
However, if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's
a great guy.  Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in 
couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their
feelings to me and I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same
way...something that's hard for them to grasp given the fact that some
flirting at some point did occur).

Well, I'm off to Vegas this weekend.  My guess is I won't be getting much
sleep.  Oh well, life is tough.

hey susan-  thought you'd appreciate this funny email from Clint in
London....  so in brief, my new theory is that eric gomez has had his heart
broken (per ""Someone Like You"") and therefore must act like a slut to
ignore the pain.  Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at
the padres game.....i am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on
saturday.  at first he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i
do care about him (on some level), but as i drank more i LECTURE more,
until he finally started walking away from me!  how embarrassing!  i am
totally embarrassed that i wouldn't shut up!  even more surprised that eric
sent me the email on monday.  i didn't see it until tuesday since i didn't
work monday, but am bummed because i called him monday evening to get eric
ang's phone number.....silly concern, but he probably thinks i was calling
just to get in touch with him.  now  i will totally not make contact with
him- not even respond to his email...don't need to overinflate people's
egos!

i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5 or so
months!! i love that you have so much fun here, and everyone always
comments on how cool you are and how easy you are to be around.....everyone
would be thrilled to have you back! (me especially!)  i'll watch for good
fares, too!

write back whenever you can....talk to you soon-

jeff was very curious and mentioned to a colleague in london that i had
very good company at the beach.  i assured him that you were not married--
he was confused by your ring-- and so was i when i first saw you cruising
the halls. he thought we must be dating but i straighted him out. told him
that you were all over me at the beach after he left (just kidding!)

so are you taking friday off?

Julie,

Thanks for letting us hang out with you on the beach Sat.  It was good to
see you.  All your friends are very cool.  Say thanks to Clint for me if
you
get the chance.  We didn't last much longer that night, thank goodness.
I hope you had a nice Easter.  Other than the Lakers beating the Blazers it
was a pretty boring day.  Not to mention I was brain dead from the pickling
the two days before.
Have a good week.

Eric

Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to
do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday. I will ask though.
You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and
leaving Korea on Sunday). The total air fare should be $962. Shoot me
a quick e mail if this is not ok. Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing
your tickets this afternoon. Thanks!

Thanks, But No Thanks: Turning Down the Offer
by Carole Martin
	[IMAGE]	
[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]	
	[IMAGE]	

In today's job market, it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer. Everyone should be so lucky as to even get an offer. But you need to stop and think before you jump out of desperation into a situation that is not good for you. Even though it may be uncomfortable, there are times when you have to say, ""Thanks, but no thanks.""
Great News; You've Got an Offer
George was laid off from his job in June. After four months of rejection, he finally got an offer. He was excited. Or was he?
It really wasn't the job he wanted. It was just one of the jobs he had applied for, because he was qualified and could perform the duties. The job really didn't match any of his values. Taking this job meant a long commute in heavy traffic. Financially, it was going to be a lateral move. But, most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity. The thought of going to this job day after day depressed him before he even accepted.
How could he turn down an offer after so many months of waiting? He was dreading telling his wife about the offer for fear she would think he was crazy for not taking it. How could he tell the company he didn't want the job after going through all those interviews?
Do What You Want
The company wanted to know by the end of the week. George was making himself sick thinking about the decision. That afternoon, he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times. ""Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do,"" was the message. George knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to continue looking for a better opportunity.
When he told his wife, not only was she understanding, but she was encouraging as well. ""Life is too short to make decisions that are going to make you miserable,"" she told George. The decision was made. George would turn down the offer. Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it.
Making the Call
The next morning George placed a call to the hiring manager. ""I've thought over the offer extended and have made a career decision not to accept the position,"" he told the manager. ""I am grateful to you for believing in me, and I hope there may be an opportunity for us to do business in some way in the future."" The hiring manager was disappointed but said he understood career decisions and the need to do what's in one's best interest.
It takes courage and maturity to reject a job you really don't want. The best way to handle difficult decisions is to weigh the consequences and decide what is best for you. Since you don't want to alienate a business contact in the process, it is best to be as professional about the conversation as you can. Preparing a script ahead of time will assist you with your discomfort. No one likes confronting unpleasant situations, but one difficult moment compared to weeks, months or even years of work you find unpleasant is a small price to pay.

she left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in NB tonight....

no one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to austin this weekend or not.....

emily talked to matt and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend, but that next weekend would be good...and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in NB next weekend....so it looks like next weekend in NB is a definite gathering....

as for this weekend....depending on work today, which will suck, i may try to drive to NB tonight and spend the night there...i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to LOTS of family time on saturday and sunday in austin b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with chris and chuck....therefore, if you want to go to NB as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w/ emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday....

either give me a call later or email me back w/ your thoughts...

where are you?  it's been ages since i heard from you- are you ok?  you know
it makes me nervous when you go AWOL.....matt called this morning and he
sounds really bad.  is doing that oh-so-familiar over-analyzing and
internalizing that would make almost anyone suicidal considering the
situation.  just want to be home so badly.  feel so isolated here.  wish we
were all out on the walker's patio now chatting, and i was with mom and dad
and harls.  i think that's the only place where i'd feel safe and reassured
and as close to happy as i could be right now.  kind of like the way
everyone described josh's funeral.  horrifying, but as good a company to
rebound with as you could find probably.  has been such a long and draining
month emotionally and physically, and am just gutted. hope you're a bit more
buoyant rt now han i am.  am trying to get home asap, but mom and dad don't
want me to fly.  am not worried about it, and am going to try to get on
first flight possible anyways, so may see y'all soon....pls email and let me
know you're still alive and in proportionally good spirits...

"RE: Unmapped curves","If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

How do I find out the omicron curves for these curves?  Would George know?

"RE: Happy 25th!","hey...

thanks for the birthday wish.  i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting.  met some friends after work (the monthly dinner group) and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma.  I had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio.  went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW houston evening, donaraki (sp?) and Matthias's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to SA, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in austin by 11am...brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's, left austin around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exhausted today.

as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.

if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march...WOW!

hope all is still going well with you.  i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.  

talk to you soon,
Sue

btw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.  i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house.

"Re:","Hey,

Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.  Take my advice though...use sunscreen!  I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.  Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water.  

So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.  I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.  My how things have changed.

I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.  She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.  All in all things are pretty good.  

Talk to you soon,
Sue

"RE: Yankee Doodle Dandy","No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's Darren going to be up to as a result of this?  

Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, Austin?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.

Thanks for note shorty.  I hope all is well in gas trading land.  I will be joining the weather derivatives desk asap as the ag effort has been shelved.  But, this afforded me the opportunity to take a vacation last week which was cool (again the charmed life of Ted Noble).  I would like to hear about your time as a trader and I have a good book for you to read about interviews with the world's top commodity traders.

Hey there,

Have a fun trip to Korea!!

Stephanie and I will absolutely pick you up at the airport on Saturday in
SLC if you decide to come in.  Katy said her flight gets in about 12:00 or
1:00pm, so it is no problem at all.  We are flying Delta #1895 out of IAH
and get in at 4:55 that Friday.  We are staying at the hotel the rehearsal
dinner is at, so we figured we would have time to shower and get ready.  I
was planning on working a 1/2 day that day.  We are leaving early that
Sunday morning, but Katy said she would get her own car that day.

Just let one of us know when you get in if you decide to go...

Talk to you later,
Ashley

"Re: this weekend","Actually...I the first available appointment on Sat is 2:00 pm (right in the thick of beach time!!).  I ended up making my reservation yesterday for 11:00 am tomorrow, I might be able to switch it to 10:00 though b/c they still had it open yesterday.  However, the 11:00 may work out perfectly.    That way when my treatment's done at 12:30 we could just start our day from there - lunch, shopping, etc.  What do you think?  I'm sure I can find some way to occupy myself for a couple of hours on Sat...no worries.

hey susan-

any chance you could get into the spa around 10:00 on saturday?  i'm sure that's a popular time, just wanted to see if that was a slot they'd had available....my study group wants to meet at 10 on saturday, and i'm planning to go for just 2 hours, so it would work great if you could do the spa thing then.  if not, then the beach is right across the street from the library where we'll be meeting so i could always join you there after my study session.....it's sprinkling right now but is supposed to clear up tomorrow and be sunny this weekend ( i hope!!). 

i cannot wait to have a weekend to relax- it has been so crazy here! 

i'll see you tonight!!worst case scenario (contingent upon weather and traffic) i'll pick you up at continental curbside baggage claim.....travel safely!

Thanks, But No Thanks: Turning Down the Offer
by Carole Martin
	[IMAGE]	
[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]	
	[IMAGE]	

In today's job market, it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer. Everyone should be so lucky as to even get an offer. But you need to stop and think before you jump out of desperation into a situation that is not good for you. Even though it may be uncomfortable, there are times when you have to say, ""Thanks, but no thanks.""
Great News; You've Got an Offer
George was laid off from his job in June. After four months of rejection, he finally got an offer. He was excited. Or was he?
It really wasn't the job he wanted. It was just one of the jobs he had applied for, because he was qualified and could perform the duties. The job really didn't match any of his values. Taking this job meant a long commute in heavy traffic. Financially, it was going to be a lateral move. But, most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity. The thought of going to this job day after day depressed him before he even accepted.
How could he turn down an offer after so many months of waiting? He was dreading telling his wife about the offer for fear she would think he was crazy for not taking it. How could he tell the company he didn't want the job after going through all those interviews?
Do What You Want
The company wanted to know by the end of the week. George was making himself sick thinking about the decision. That afternoon, he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times. ""Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do,"" was the message. George knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to continue looking for a better opportunity.
When he told his wife, not only was she understanding, but she was encouraging as well. ""Life is too short to make decisions that are going to make you miserable,"" she told George. The decision was made. George would turn down the offer. Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it.
Making the Call
The next morning George placed a call to the hiring manager. ""I've thought over the offer extended and have made a career decision not to accept the position,"" he told the manager. ""I am grateful to you for believing in me, and I hope there may be an opportunity for us to do business in some way in the future."" The hiring manager was disappointed but said he understood career decisions and the need to do what's in one's best interest.
It takes courage and maturity to reject a job you really don't want. The best way to handle difficult decisions is to weigh the consequences and decide what is best for you. Since you don't want to alienate a business contact in the process, it is best to be as professional about the conversation as you can. Preparing a script ahead of time will assist you with your discomfort. No one likes confronting unpleasant situations, but one difficult moment compared to weeks, months or even years of work you find unpleasant is a small price to pay.

I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?

Start crying because our John Neslage is moving on to bigger and better opportunities.  Of course, he has to travel the globe for two months to recover from leaving us, but Friday, August 10, is our last opportunity - at least on a daily basis - to see his smiling face. His innate ability to make us laugh will be sorely missed!

So, in between the kleenex, hugs and kisses, we are going throw back a few drinks in his honor!   Please join us Friday, 6:00 p.m. for Happy Hour at Kenneally's on 2111 Shepherd (between San Felipe and Fairview; across the street from Petsmart).

Bring friends - the more the merrier!

"Re: UGGGHHHHH","I know, I know.  It's still weird to me.  While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.  I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like ""good buddy"" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.  

On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.  I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.  I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.  It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.  I do think it's weird that Lisa never wants me to leave their presence...they both questioned me when I took off to bed last night around 9:30...I just wanted out.

NO!  again, sue- you are giving lisa too much credit- assuming she is
capable of a motivation or thought that is BEYOND our comprehension!  the
truth is, you DO understand, just don't it to be the truth- it's a dark,
scary place to go!  basically, she wants to ""show off""  what she HAS, and
yet again, PRAY you will be in full veg mode, looking as pitiful as, say, i
do rt now- on my couch, eating gummy bears- thoroughly enjoying my wasted
existance- so that she can further convince the oh-so-dimple mitch that he
""picked the RIGHT roomie!""  and i honest to god think she DOES think that
way.  or, perhaps, spending quality alone time w/ him would incenuate too
much of a relationship, and when she tries to ""capture"" the swiss boy's
affection (while cleverly using a visit w/ her good pal em as a
justification) she won't feel as bad- i mean, she and mitch WEREN'T that
close...at least, SHE wasn't.....no harm, no foul.  whoa.  should i be a
therapist, or what.  or be IN therapy- can channel people's ""dark sides"" so
easily, it MUST be a sign....must use my powers for good, must use my powers
for good....!

"Tour Guide","Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

I've been given a bit of a reprieve on the deadline.  So, if you could get back to me sometime before this afternoon that would be very helpful.

Subject:	Jennifer's Shower - RSVP

Hi Everyone,

Some of you might be aware that we are planning a Bridal Shower for Jennifer
Bowles on Nov 3rd. Invitations have not yet been sent out so don't be
alarmed if you haven't received one.

The shower will be between the hours of 7-9 (maybe 9:30 p.m.) What we were
thinking about doing afterwards is going to the Mucky Duck and catching
Jimmy LaFave, who is performing at 10 p.m. He is one of Jennifer's favorites
and we thought it would be a nice surprise.

What I need is to know is who all would be interested in going to the show?
Tickets are $15 and we need to get them ASAP. It will probably last until
midnight.

If everyone could please email me back and let me know if you are interested
in going, that would be great.

Please don't mention this to Jennifer, we want to keep it a surprise.

Thank You,
Sarah

Dan Electro's Guitar Bar 
The bluesy music at this six-string bar has drawn celebrities and scenesters for years. 

Bar/Club Profile	
The Scene
The bar's large courtyard, canopied entirely by trees, makes outdoor conversation pleasant even on Houston's sultry summer nights. 

The Sound
Patrons (""real nice folks"") can settle in among the guitars with $2 draft beers and enjoy an eclectic sampling of music, from blues to alternative country, rock to folk. 

Electro-fying Blues
Thursday night's blues jam has been going on for more than 10 years and shows no signs of letting up, especially since it draws the likes of Greg Allman and Richard Gere. If you're really lucky, you might even catch Jim, the owner, wailing away onstage on one of his own Danelectro guitars.

"RE:","Well, I think I managed to adequately disturb her yesterday.  Not only did I go to the Menil collection by myself (can you imagine?)...I also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo.  When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats.  My immediate response, ""Actually, I needed some solo time.""  Subject closed.  As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.  Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.  I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.  And ditto on the witty repartee.

Subject:	Entities that do not need FERC power marketing authorization

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their primary business is as a utility, like Enron).  

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

Subject:	Entities that do not need power marketing authorization


Christi-

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing authorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.""

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to have rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to state agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most provisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilities making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which authorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided cost.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at market-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.

We tried so hard to make things better for our kids
that we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like
for them to know about hand me down clothes and
homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I
really would. I hope you learn humility by being
humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being
cheated. I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow
the lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody
gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. It
will be good if at least one time you can see puppies
born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a
black eye fighting for something you believe in, I
hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line
down the middle of the room, but when he wants to
crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I
hope you let him. When you want to see a movie and
your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll
let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can
do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two
blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone
as uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope
your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying
one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you
also learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope
you get teased by your friends when you have your
first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your
mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.
May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you
hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen
flagpole. I don't care if you try a beer once, but I
hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your
friend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch
with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. May
you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the
holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you
throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and
that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These
things I wish for you through tough times and
disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, its
the only way to appreciate life. Send this to all of
your friends who mean the most to you. We secure our
friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.

Subject:	Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).  
	 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale.
	-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports.
	-- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 2001.

"RE:","Hi Sarah,

So nice to here from you....

I'm actually still employed right now, but don't have a heck of a lot to do around here.  We're all in somewhat of a holding pattern, waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy etc.  Hope all is well with you!  I haven't made any real decisions regarding my living situation.  My roommate and I have movers coming the weekend before Christmas and as of right now I had just planned on moving back in with the folks...on a temporary basis of course!  Anyway, I'm just not really sure where I'll be 2 or 3 months from now, so I'm obviously reluctant to sign any long term leases etc.  If a temporary roommate is something you guys would be interested in I'd certainly like to discuss the prospect w/ you...but I would also completely understand if you'd prefer to get somebody in there who's more permanent.

My number at work is 713-853-1455 and home is 713-622-2788....

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey Susan,

How are you? I've wanted to catch up with you and see how things are going?
I wanted to find out about your job etc? Also, I am not sure if you decided
on your living situation but if you are looking, one of my roommates is
going to move out at the end of this month and I wanted to see if maybe you
were interested. It is a 3 bedroom cute house on the border of Montrose and
West U. Give me a call when you get a chance or send me your number and I
will call you. 713-522-5881.

Talk soon,
Sarah

I wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations.  They last time I came to Seattle I used the following web-site and managed to get a very good deal on my hotel.  http://www.seattlesupersaver.com In the past, I've stayed at both the Westin and Mayflower which seem to be in fairly central locations downtown.  I wasn't sure if you would be making the reservations or if you would prefer that I handle that aspect.  You can either email me back or call me at the office if you would like to discuss any of this in more detail.  My work number is 713-853-1455.

"horoscope","Mom must be at it again....

career meter:
You find out late this week that your suspicions were right on. You've known for some time that a particular person didn't have your best interests at heart, and this week's revelations confirm your suspicions. It may be time to take flight and move in a different, more fulfilling direction.

love meter:
You feel more sure-footed and in control of your private life by the end of the week, mainly because the uncertainty that has hung over you like shroud finally lifts. It's liberating knowing where you stand.
weekly horoscope:
For February 4-10: A loved one may make a momentous choice, once Saturn and Mercury move direct. This could happen as early as this weekend, but may take longer. The point is that your life, circumstances, and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice. Welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is. Don't be afraid. For some time, you've known things were not right -- and something had to give. Be very cautious about who you confide in. At this point, the walls have ears. As you establish a new chapter in your life, play your cards very close to your vest. 
Thought you might enjoy.....

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Enron Corp Business Controls@ENRON
Sent:	Wednesday, September 19, 2001 8:12 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Paul's deal with Petrogulf is for 265.  The June deal was 360.  Every month will have a 10% swing on it.  I haven't looked at the numbers yet for July to see what volume we'll actually be purchasing.  
I think he always rolls the EJW and I haven't seen a fax from them yet.  I'll let you know.

Thanks Theresa.

Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.

"Referral from Tim Bowler","Hi Herb,

Tim Bowler had actually given me your name and email address a little while back and thought it would be a good idea for me to drop you a line.  I have been working with Tim for a couple weeks at Enron and, upon learning that I was in the midst of job hunting, he suggested I contact you.  For the last year I served as an assistant trader on the West Natural Gas Desk (Wholesale).  For various reasons I chose to decline an offer in February with the newly formed UBSW Energy and am currently still working for Enron.  I'm attaching a copy of my resume to give you a better idea of my background and experience.  If you know of any opportunities that seem like possible ""good fits"" I would very much appreciate hearing about them.

 

Thank you,
Susan Scott

"RE: Unmapped curves","They should if they are dealing with transport, gas daily options,  etc. which are effected by the omicrons.  I would typically go to the leads of the respective regions, tell them which curves are unmapped and let them decide what omicron curve to use ( a lot of times they just asked the trader in charge of that point which curve to use).  

If the leads don't know what the omicron curves are the company's in trouble!

you're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

Subject:	so they say NEVER SAY NEVER. . .

I swore I would be one of those people who said never and really meant it.   
Well, I guess ""they"" are right . . .     
Clay and I have some news.  (No, I am not pregnant.)  But, we are buying a  
house in Dallas.  We close on it two days after my arrival in London.   
Thankfully, Clay will still be here.  We will rent it out over the next year  
while we are away.  Our move in date will be sometime next summer, depending  
on our tenants' situation.   
So, about the never say never part.  The house is in south Highland Park.   
Gasp!  We never expected to buy a house this soon.  And, I NEVER--I repeat  
NEVER-- expected that we would move to Highland Park upon graduating from law  
school, if EVER!  In fact, it was a condition of our marriage--I knew that we  
were going to end up in Dallas, but I made Clay promise that we would not  
have to settle in the Park Cities.  He promised, crossed his heart, hoped to  
die, and the whole bit.  All summer, we have been neighborhood shopping in  
Lakewood and East Dallas, an area that is close to downtown with wonderful  
homes and a sort of Austiny-feel.    
We spent some time checking out real estate cites on the web during our  
down-time at work, on a strictly just-for-fun basis.  We loved looking at  
older homes.  We dreamed about eventually getting something that was very  
livible for the time being but that would be really fun to update and  
restore.  Independently, we both came across a house in south east Highland  
Park (near the McKinney and Knox Henderson area) that was built in 1925 in  
the Craftsman style--our favorite.  We drove by it and checked it out on the  
internet for about three weeks.  Finally, we decided to call up a realtor and  
go see it.  We immediately fell in love--wood floors, beautiful original  
fixtures and ""rookwood"" fireplace, 9 foot ceilings, great backyard, etc.     
During the three week period, I had a huge and slightly dramatic internal  
debate about living in this area.  Would this mean I was destined to a life  
of suburban-driving, PTA morning, bubble head-ism???  Would we ever be able  
to escape our parents who live merely 5-7 minutes away?  Was I, deep-down,  
really a total snob?  If not, would I become one?  Would I have to go to the  
neighborhood Tom Thumb?  Would I become my mother?  
The bottom line was that we loved the house--the craftsman style lets us to  
combine Clay's desire for traditionalism and my love for modern design.  (In  
other words, it's a place where my red leather couch and his stuffed deer  
head might live comfortable together.)  Also, we really loved the location (6  
minutes from Downtown; right by our favorite restaurants and bar spots; and  
very close to the Katy Trail--Dallas' jogging biking trail).  So, I decided  
that we could make  Park Cities life work. . . I would just have to  
concentrates on the things that I always have said I WILL do, rather than the  
things I have said I would NEVER do.  I will invest in the lives of needy  
people; I will keep painting; I will remember that people, instead of things,  
make the world go 'round.   
After much prayer and consideration, Clay and I put down a REALLY low-ball  
offer on the house.  We negotiated for about a week, and the sellers finally  
accepted our offer.  We feel terribly blessed, and our prayer is that our  
home can be put to use for God's purposes.  (And, perhaps, a TX-OU party??)   
I am thankful for a husband who was fortunate enough to save every penny he  
ever earned and every little birthday check he ever received--and for a  
father-in-law who helped us get an excellent interest rate.   
So, that's the news . . . let the making fun of Jessica begin . . . I

"RE: Re:","As usual Alan, I am left somewhat disturbed by your words...and by the way, do you ever return phone calls?  As for the rest of you guys, I anxiously await our impending reunion in Cap City.  Glad to hear everyone seems to be doing okay, with the exception of Emily who appears to be suffering from a severe case of spring fever.  Jon Jon, went to an Astros game a couple weeks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard...it made me feel special.  The trader I work with, who was there with me, is a huge baseball fan and upon hearing I went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats regularly...seems you're not doing to shabby.  Congrats.  Life for me is pretty good, although I'm in desperate need of a deep, drunken conversation regarding life and all it's complexities (I expect everyone to contribute to said discussion when we convene).  I'm sure I'm not the only one, but things just seem to be getting less certain the older I get.  Don't want to get to heavy now...so I'll saw the really bleak stuff for Austin.

Sorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.  Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.

Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.

Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could

wow, huh?

anyway, got your email with the articles for wahso...going to read them right now.  looks like i may be moving tomorrow, so i'll let you know what the future holds for me when i have a better idea.  

more importantly, i wanted to tell you how proud i am of you.  not only for striking out to park city on your own, but also for making the impression you obviously have on the people with whom you work.  it's often hard to see when you are the person in question, but i can tell you from my perspective that the people you work & associate with think very highly of you.  and, i'm thrilled that windy ridge vocalized their appreciation of you and your skills...definitely something you deserved to hear.  it is a great gift to be a person others have confidence in and want to be around, and those are qualities that you possess without question.  

driving into work this morning my sister called on the cell phone, said she had a special message for me...then mack and sally got on the phone and they sang happy birthday to me...i'm such a sap i couldn't help but to start tearing-up.  after they hung up i took a moment to examine where i am in my life right now, and i'm happy to report that i am pleased.  i tried to imagine my emotions had i decided to stay on w/ the group and i don't think my optimism would be nearly so great.  my point is this, sometimes not knowing exactly what the future holds frees you to imagine and dream of things you normally wouldn't.  so to you i say, the sky is the limit....dream, imagine, explore.  we are both going to do great things in and with our lives.  but what i think we need to realize is the scale of those things may be smaller (or even grander) than we'd imagined...point being,  we just need to try and be aware of those opportunities which come along every day that afford us those great moments be they large or small.

cheers!

That's totally fine- I completely understand.  I was considering going up to  Ventura to visit a friend for the weekend, but of course didn't want to make any plans until I heard from you.  Sounds like you have a lot of fun events coming up!  I'll email you- there might be 2 other weekends that work for me - unfortunately time is flying SO fast!!  But even if you can't come out before the end of October, we'll have to plan some time to get together soon....I'll send you those dates later.

Subject:	RE: Happy Hour

you're right, the events of this past week were tough, but on reflection these events have not made me want to crawl in a corner and be afraid- just the opposite - they made me realize that life is fragile and short.  so why not enjoy it in the company of some good friends?

No offense :-)

We're leaving in about a 1/2 hour for the airport and I am extremely excited about the trip.  I will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks.  Actually, I'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on Saturday out to some island (I will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island).  Additionally, we've got first class dinners booked every night and I should be able to fit in a massage...I know, it's sick.  

Also, I'm sure you noticed that I emailed Niclas about you so the door has been cracked open...Just a warning though, based on a Tuesday night conversation with Lisa I'm afraid our dear Mitch may be biting the dust soon.  We'll see though, she has become very flighty (okay, is flighty) when it comes to guys.

"RE:","Mine is sscott5_2000.  If you go to yahoo's home page you can try to install it yourself (eek!!!) or use the search on your computer (go to Start..Search...For Files or Folders) and type in Yahoo Messenger.  If you still have it on your computer it will show up in the search area and you can just double click on it...that should bring it up.

I'm doing alright.  And you hit the nail on the head with the Josh comment....that's exactly what I've been reminded of.  That feeling of uncertainty...loss of youthful bravado, sadness, injured sense of security...all of it.  Everyone in the Scott household is fine.  Dad actually flew over NY yesterday morning before the first plane hit.  He was coming from Manchester, NH.  He said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over Central Park...no idea how dramatically that skyline would change.  The first they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they landed in Nashville.  He's still in Nashville right now obviously, but he's okay and that's what's important.  I'm hoping with the limited flights they're allowing that Dad will be able to make it back to Houston soon, but it appears the FAA's just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result.  Chuck and Chris were supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from Seoul but they too have been delayed - indefinitely.  The Army has put a hold on all duty station transfers which means we have no idea when they'll be leaving Korea or where exactly Chuck will be going.  The stories and connections of the people on the news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening.  A large number of people we do business with are based in NY and have lost countless friends and colleagues in the WTC's destruction.  Chuck has some pledge brother's who are working up there, but we've heard that both of them are okay. 

I wish you were back home as well....I was on the phone with my Mom off and on all day yesterday and I must say it would've been nice to been back home on the couch with her.  I did talk to Jen yesterday worried about LA and what was going on there, but she was fine as well.  She said they'd shut down the airport and several major roads surrounding it, but nothing else of concern.

We evacuated the Enron building around 9:30 yesterday morning...it was disconcerting.  I walked down the 32 flights of stairs to get to my parking garage and had only one desire...to get out of downtown.  There were rumors flying that Houston was another target and given the size of our building, our international presence (esp. in regards to oil/natural gas) and our CEO's connections to the President...I think everyone figured Enron would be a logical target.  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.

On a lighter note...I'm very anxious to hear all about your marathon experience...including the trip there.  Sounds like it was a doozey.

Love ya,
Sue

Paul's deal with Petrogulf is for 265.  The June deal was 360.  Every month will have a 10% swing on it.  I haven't looked at the numbers yet for July to see what volume we'll actually be purchasing.  
I think he always rolls the EJW and I haven't seen a fax from them yet.  I'll let you know.

Thanks Theresa.

Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.

"This weekend","Stopped by Em's last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Austin this weekend.  She'd already talked to Katy and it sounded like Katy was interested in Austin tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.  Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.  Emily and Katy would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.  As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.

"Mr. & Mrs. T...","Hey Lisa,

Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.

Thanks,
Sue

so glad yall liked the market and ""the bite""...

i think the seattle market is so neat. some of those people travel 2
hours every day to get to seattle to sell their fruits, flowers, etc.
alot of them are asian immigrants just trying to ""make it"" in america-
all the ""stalls"" where they sell fish, etc are great small business

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  It's been really busy here lately.
You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up
kayaking.
Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.
It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and
Vancouver.

The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of
time
outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled
shrimp
there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We
also
hit ""the Bite"" which was really neat.

Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me
know
the next time you're in Houston.  It be great to see you again.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan

      hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
   when
      i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might
have
   info
      on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want
to
   try
      seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good
and
      helpful

      i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for
the
      weekend unfortunately....

      i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday
morning,
      and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
      night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want
to
      do!

      the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
   you
      never know.

      my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket
for
      sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
   believe
      me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
   could
      get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

      ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
      definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
   friday.
      the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
   anytime
      on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
      message and ill call you back.

      very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday
hopefully.

      oh, where are you staying?

      Hi Bonnie,

      How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
   have
      been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
   riding
      public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
   have
      some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in
Seattle.
   One
      of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long
weekend
   in
      your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope
you're
      still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It
looks
      like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good
thing
      for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
      offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
   live
      in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit
of
   a
      research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
   for
      restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great,
and
      maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a
drink.

      Thanks a bunch,
      Susan

Subject:	WEST DESKS--FERC authorizes power marketers to purchase from industrials (and more)

On March 14, 01, FERC issued an ""Order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and gas supply in the West..""  (Docket No. EL01-47).

	Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01.  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the industrials).  (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that request by mid-May.)

In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates.

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).  
	 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale.
	-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports.
	-- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff -- must file a rate schedule at FERC for this, but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and authorizations.
	-- This authorization expires after 12/31/01.
Effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01, retail customers in WSCC, as permitted by state laws and regulations, and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at market-based rates.  These transactions can occur in several ways:  An aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load under retail choice programs.  In addition, wholesale and retail load with contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of power is greater than the value of consumption.  Similar quarterly reports would be due by EPMI/EES.
NOTE:  the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with transmission provider (may need new interconnection facilities, etc.) 
Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is wheeled away from the industrial.

Other initiatives in the order:

Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers.  FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are required to be filed at FERC.
Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities.
Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current, including CBM and TRM.
Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service by July 1 (and to a lesser extent -- by November 1 of 01 and 02).
Considers ""rolled in"" rates for generation interconnection (rather than direct assignment that we have now.)
Extends temporary waivers through 12/31/01 of operating and efficiency standards for QFs.  Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates, if sold in California and the WSCC.
FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching load (ie, if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection requests, etc.)
Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review.

Please let me know if you would like the order.  Ray Alvarez (202-466-9170) and I (713-853-7007) can assist you with this.  Thanks.

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

"RE: Tour Guide","It's so nice to hear from you!

Actually, we're coming this weekend.  We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.  At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San Juan's (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).  Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.  To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.  I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.

Thanks again,
Susan

Subject:	RE: Tour Guide

we should definitely get together. so when are yall coming? where are
you staying? i have a lot of suggestions, as i have done the whole
touristy thing here in seattle when i first moved here.

i am betting you are staying downtown or near downtown which is
perfect/. and getting around seattle is easy- you can either take bus,
or if you dont feel like it, you can always take cabs as they are
readily available in the downtown area.

you must see pike place market--- its downtown on the waterfront, where
they have fresh fish, etc/ very neat/

then there is the experience music project, an awesome museum -
literally like nothing you have ever seen before. very interesting.

for outdoor stuff, i would say Discovery Park, which is about a 15
minute drive from downtown.  it is beautiful.

write me and let me know when you and your co worker are coming (as in,
what weekend)--- i hope it is a weekend that i am planning to be here! i
would love to meet up.

let me know
bonnie

Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have
been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding
public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have
some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One
of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

"Saturday Night","See...I told you you were invited.  I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.  Let me know what you think.  I'd been planning on going to the Kim Richey concert Sat night at the Fab Satellite Lounge (along with Corey, Doug, and yourself if you were interested).  Honestly think I'd rather go to the concert, but I would feel somewhat guilty.  What are your thoughts?

"RE: Nathan Thomas","Paul,

So nice to hear from you.  I hope things are going great for you as well.  I'm actually going Laura Jahnke's wedding that same evening.  Otherwise, I would have loved to have gone.  Please tell Nathan I say, ""hello"" and wish he and his new wife the very best.  So when does school start?  And, how are the small businesses going?

Have a nice time at the wedding,

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the birthdays simple.

Once again I am so impressed with your organizational skills when it comes to this wedding.  Just wanted to let you know that I will definitely be attending the luncheon on Friday and may even end up riding to SA with Jen (which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable).

As for the ""Manicures and Pedicures for the Girls"", I would like to put my order in for a Turkey Breast sandwich on white.  I can't wait till next weekend, it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here?

Love ya,

I'll try and give you a call after work ( around 4:30 or so ) if you want to talk about it some more, just let me know.  I do think it's good that you guys are at least talking about all this stuff regardless of what you decide is the right for both of you.  

Sorry to hear about Jay...that is horrible.  What brings on shingles anyway?  I thought it has something to do with stress, but I could be totally off.

Glad you like the CD...I've been listening to it non-stop.  I'm totally empowered after ""I'm Alright"" and then plunge into super-reflective mode with ""Wildest Dreams"".  Get on the Kim Richey web site and read the lyrics and you'll understand why.  By the way, she's playing at Stubb's on June 14th and in Houston at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge on the 16th....food for thought.

As for my call, there was some news...he contacted me around 10 am or so and we chatted throughout the day.  I'll tell you more about it when I call, but you're only going to be a bigger fan.  That of course is the problem I'm having.

Talk to you soon,

Hey Susan-
I got your message last night but it was late-- Doug and I went to see Pearl Harbor.  I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I did.
I took him to work this morning, and he was asking me about the law firm parties this summer-- was he going to be coming in for them, etc.  Although I hadn't planned to, I suggested that we take the summer off from dating.  We had a long conversation about it, and he was much better about it than he has been in the past.  It made me wonder...  He said he had thought about that kind of thing, too, but didn't want to do it.  But, if I needed it, he said he would be okay with it.  He did say he might join the Marines rather than go to law school.  I have always thought that is what he wanted to do, so maybe I am being less selfish by breaking up with him.  I don't know.  I feel pretty bad about it.  I just think this is probably a mistake, but I explained to him that I have had a boyfriend my entire adult life and I am wondering what it would be like without one.  He is in just about the same boat reagrding having had a ! girlfriend for the vast majority of his adult years.
Anyway, we might have lunch together, and we will definitely talk about it after he gets home from work.
On another note, Jay has shingles.  Isn't that sad.  I looked it up in my medical book-- they are very painful and leave scars-- and she has them on her face.  How awful!
I bought that Kim Richey CD yesterday.  I love it!
Were you calling with any news?

as for me, i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week.  but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 10 or so years of my life...and i think it gave me the extra shove, push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in.  i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden ""illness"", b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological...i had an appointment for a final chat last night, and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do...but i did it, on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship....so there it is, now it just up to me to ""stay sober"" so to speak and kick the habit for good.

Subject:	El Paso 1110 Update (9/5)

Here's the latest on El Paso line #1110...

Line #1110 is expected to be back online during this week following the installation of a release valve.
Sources at El Paso report that when #1110 comes back up, there will be no significant increase of capacity flowing through the South Main Line System because there is currently no market demand for the increase.
The OPS corrective action order is expected to be lifted later this fall, thereby granting the system permission to return to full capacity. However, there is a possibility that El Paso will not increase capacity on the system even then. This will depend on market demand at that time.

We will continue to follow this situation and will update you as significant developments occur. Please let me know if you have any questions.

"good article","Lisa,

This article's pretty good and it does mention India in some context, so I thought you might be interested.  The India comment is several paragraphs in to the article.

"Re: Spa Schedule","I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.  I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful.

I had a great time in London and came back with some Cubans for Dad and a 1920's platinum and diamond watch for myself...can't wait for you to see it.  Give me a call sometime, would like to hear what's new in your life.

Attached please find comments on the Illinois Energy Workshop.  I have reviewed Pam Stroebel's comments which were basically in support of the development of more generation .  She commented that Illinois' reserve margins are adequate over the next few years.  Interestingly, she claims that Com Ed has one of the largest curtailable programs in the country.  She has industrial customers representing 1200 Mw of Capacity under contract.

"Re: This Weekend...","I've got Deborah Vest's wedding next weekend so that's a no go, but I was thinking about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe that will work.  I would actually love to skip out on the wedding...however, since the wedding's in Houston and I live here, I don't have a very good excuse do I?

And don't worry...we could wait two years and I'd still want to chat about Vegas.  One of those things you'll never really forget.  I'm sure I sounded funny and I was definitely tired, but in now way were either of these bad things.

Subject:	Re: This Weekend...


Here is my suggestion--

Let's push everything back one week.  My finals are finished Saturday
morning (the 5th), and we could go to Barton Springs immediately afterward,
and eat dinner, and rent a movie, and shop on Sunday, etc.

I am really so behind on my school work that I can't justify taking time off
this weekend.  I would try my hardest, but I just don't think I would be
very much fun.

However, I would love to talk about Vegas.  I've been wondering about it
because I thought you sounded funny.  Maybe you were just tired.

Let me know.

-Corey

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.

Just remembered that Cory Morrow is playing at the Firehouse Friday night and Owen Temple is going to be at the Mucky Duck.  If you have any interest in doing something Friday let me know.  Maybe we could grab dinner and go see one of these guys play.  I figure you'll be shopping and jaunting around town all day Saturday with Mom, and Sunday is Mother's day...so Friday seems like the best day to get together.

Haven't talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.  

Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for Austin this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Caymans last weekend, Lisa's wedding this weekend and San Diego next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and Doug Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and Doug.

To be honest with you I had had a pretty bad day and the rest of the week hadn't been much better, but I had a really good time last night....I forget sometimes how nice it is to share so many great memories with old friends.  Not to get too sappy, but I really treasure our friendships and I'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys.  I know it's rarely overt, but I've leaned on the stability and solidness of our friendships on countless occasions and just don't know what I'd do without that safety net to trust in when things are rough.

Sounds perfect....  I'm also being a wimp about driving home tonight because
I've been feeling like I am about to get sick for three days. Someone told
me the mold count was high, which would explain it.

Leslie is moving to Houston tomorrow.  She is living at the Extended Stay
America near you.  (So is Joe.)  I will tell her to give you a call-- she
will be working at the DA's office.  Lots of single guys with social
consciences who know that money isn't everything....

"RE: Hello!","Hi George

You will want to liquidate the June Exotic Options today (using the valuation spreadsheet- Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls) as well as update the Option P&L file to account for the June Exotic option's value you calculate.  You will actually roll-over the Options P&L tomorrow, after you finalize the 31st's P&L (the final P&L file will include any Prior Month Adjustments as well as broker fees).  

You will update the Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls when the actual published indexes come out...so that will most likely be Monday.  At that point you can send the file to Beatrice Reyna in it's final version.

If you have any other questions just come by and get me and we'll go over them.

How is everything?  What do you suggest I do to become a trader? ...?  ...?   
The last question is when should I liquidate Jun Exotic Option and update Option P&L file.

Sorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.  Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.

I think you can skip Deborah's wedding.  Your good excuse is that I have to
work the next weekend.  Starting on Thursday (the 10th), I have to do Law
Review stuff until the issue we are working on is finished.  It could be two
weeks-- it could be right up until I have to start work...  I don't really
know.  Of course, I won't be working all day everyday, so we could do
dinner, a movie, etc. that weekend.

I don't want to encourage you not to go to Deborah's wedding, but, frankly,
I am all weddinged out.  Have you made plans to go with anyone?  Maybe
something could mysteriously come up...

Oh well-- it's up to you-- you could decide next Saturday if you want to...

"Re: Fwd:","Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.  

Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.  

I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.

Talk to you soon,

Hello Susan!

I feel terrible that I haven't talked to you in so long.  Third year of med
school is a little on the crazy side!  I've been wanting to call you, but for
some reason, I can't find your phone number.  I called information, and tried
to call a Susan Scott in Houston, but I wasn't sure if it was the right one of
not.  (There were several)  So, just email your phone number to me (and your
address if you don't mind--I don't have your current one), and I will call you
tomorrow sometime--I'm on call tonight, so I won't be home until very late!

I hope you're doing well and not having to work so, so hard these days!  I
miss you and all the girls--we need a reunion soon!  Take care!

Love,
Elizabeth

Subject:	Texas - Retail Market

Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in EPMI.  This details out verious aspects of the Texas retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Texas market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for EPMI to enter the Texas Retail market by January 1, 2002.  
	1)  Complete ERCOT LSE application
	2)  Review market requirements
	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)
		Delivery Service Agreement
		Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Authorization
		Electronic Data Exchange Trading Partner Agreement

Please feel free to contact me at 712-366-3399 or page me at 888-912-1426, if you have any questions or if I can be of assistance in getting EPMI in the Texas Retail Market.

1)  Need to complete the ERCOT LSE application, copy attached.  ERCOT Contact for assistance:  Karen Berman 512-248-3171
 
2)  Need to review background information from ERCOT Protocol Sections #15 (Customer Registration) and #19 (Texas Standard Electronic Transactions), copies attached.
  
3)  I have attached a copy of a Texas Market Analysis that I prepared for EES.  The general rules are identical for each TDSP service territory.  This provides details of the implementation requirements.
 
4)  EDI Implementation Guides (Version 1.4) to support the Texas Market Opening January 1, 2002, have just been released.  This Version will be the basis for Flight 1001 testing.  Additional information including scenario maps, change control process, etc., can be found at http://www.ercot.com/Tac/RetailISOAdHocCommittee/Customer/SET/keydocs/Keydocs.htm.

 
5)  There is a detailed EDI testing plan in place for Texas.  This testing process is administered by the Independent Third Party Testing Administrator (ITPTA).  The website where all of this information can be reviewed is http://itpta.intellimark-it.com/.  Attached is the Testing Signoff Worksheet that must be completed prior to beginning the testing process.  Tentative key testing dates for Flight 1001 (the last testing flight for January 1, 2002 market opening) are:
	August 30th		Mandatory Market Orientation for Trading Partners
	September 11th		All paperwork must be submitted for testing
	September 13th		Flight 1001 Connectivity Testing will begin
	September 27th		Flight 1001 Kickoff

"RE:","Good luck with the paper...I know how inspired you get when deadlines start approaching, so I'm sure it'll be fabulous.  Sorry about the pulled muscle.  What exactly does that do to the marathon plans?  Will you be able to compete still, or are you just going to hit all the wine stops now?  

I think you're right about Katy's move to Dallas. I have a feeling she's actually going to really like being there and working.  I pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses, etc. so she won't have to make too big of an adjustment right off the bat.  

As for me, Seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change.  Enron doesn't have any offices up there.  The closest office is Portland and for obvious and now unavoidable reasons I don't see a move there any time soon.  You are right about not being able to go wrong with a place possessing Austin-like qualities...they are highly desirable.

I will most certainly try to keep the September date open...it would be great to see Britney and Arden.  We had Susan E.'s bachelorette party Saturday night (plus a bridal shower earlier that day).  Lisa hosted Laura White's at the apartment the same night.  I got to see and visit with Jenny Kenair (sp?), Janie Pitman, Rachel Pack among others.  Very interesting.  The two bachelorette parties met up at Black Swan for late night dancing.  Lis was in rare form.  I knew it was bad when she ran up and started hugging me....I think she almost crushed Susan and Kelly.  Anyway, it was actually pretty fun and I've decided I really like Susan's sister Betsy...good sense of humor and not at all be-boppy.  I did manage to trick her into doing the V-I-C-T-O-R-Y cheer at Black Swan though.  I thought it was pretty darn funny myself...she was mortified when she realized I'd got her to do a cheer.

Once again...best of luck banging out your opus.  Talk to you soon.

Churchill...

Dear Dad,

Well, we are still out at sea, with little direction as to what our next
priority is.  The remainder of our port visits, which were to be centered on
max liberty and goodwill to the United Kingdom, has all but been cancelled.
We have spent every day since the attacks going back and forth within
imaginary boxes drawn in the ocean, standing high-security watches, and
trying to make the best of our time. It hasn't been that fun I must confess,
and to be even more honest, a lot of people are frustrated at the fact that
they either can't be home, or we don't have more direction right now. We
have seen the articles and the photographs, and they are sickening. Being
isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is
happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the effects.

About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the bridge to conduct
Ship handling drills. We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call
from the LUTJENS(D185), a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the
pier in Plymouth, England. While in port, the WINSTON S CHURCHILL and the
LUTJENS got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made
some pretty good friends.

Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close
up on our port side, to say goodbye.  We prepared to render them honors on
the bridge wing, and the Captain told the crew to come topside to wish them
farewell.  As they were making their approach, our Conning Officer announced
through her binoculars that they were flying an American flag.  As they came
even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast. The bridge wing was
crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles- Attention to
Port- the ship came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the
German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues.  They had made up
a sign that was displayed on the side that read ""We Stand By You"".

Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed
alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes.  It was probably the
most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life and more than a few of us
fought to retain our composure.  It was a beautiful day outside today. We
are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecured e-mail our location, but
we could not have asked for a finer day at sea.  The German Navy did an
incredible thing for this crew, and it has truly been the highest point in
the days since the attacks.  It's amazing to think that only a half-century
ago things were quite different, and to see the unity that is being
demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us all feel proud to be
out here doing our job.  After the ship pulled away and we prepared to begin
our man overboard drills the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said, ""I'm
staying Navy.""

I'll write you when I know more about when I'll be home, but for now, this
is probably the best news that I could send you.

bonjour girls- am relishing the balmy london weather- today: 73 degrees and
breezy- and no rain to speak of.  sorry- had to rub it in a little.
anyways, got an email from marci's LA friend that i met while he was
visiting in london.  he is a producer working for animal planet doing
documentaries on dog shows, one of which took him to london.  now he's
coming to houston this wednesday for the reliant energy dog show, and
emailed me to let me know, since he's ""helping"" dad find the ultimate female
GSP.  so.....i emailed him bk, suggesting he try to meet up w/ y'all, that
you could show him the houston ropes, so to speak, and gave him your names
and phone #s.  kates- you already know jim from LA, and maybe marce has
already given him your #.  am not sure.  but anyways, he is really nice,
easy to talk to (even for moi, miss antisocial) and could be a fun night
out.  just wanted to give you  heads up in case some weirdo named jim casey
called and you were totally clueless....chat w/ you soon!  merci, little
hostesses!

"RE: Whats up?","hey...how's it going?

sorry i've haven't emailed in so long...things have been busy.  btw, matt did decide to take the job with UBS.

as for myself, i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there.  they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it...i have until the end of the month to make up my mind.  meanwhile, i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up.  living at home has been interesting.  mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn.  still, the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now.

i'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris...i'm very excited to see their house and the area.  i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip...ha.  also, some other exciting news - kathy and travis are pregnant with their third!!!  babies galore in the scott clan...that is, of course, except for me.

talk to you soon,
susan

the pictures you took were great...can't wait to see more.  take care.

Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the
first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???

i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work
out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very
excited to visit you in seattle when i return. i must say that you did
a very bold thing turning down UBS without having  another job
lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean
break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with UBS going to
 relocate or stay in houston? did lenhart accept? how long did you
have to make your decision? are you still working at enron for the
moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a
paycheck?  what does your mom think about seattle? i cant
believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...
just excited to hear.

yvette and erik have accepted jobs at Huber and are staying in
houston, but signed the contract to sell there house before they
accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.
anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail
 email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent
been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to
find you if you leave enron soon.

talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week
 in kodai.

Just wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you again for taking the time to meet with me on Thursday.  I know your schedule has been busy of late, but I very much appreciated having the chance to speak with you regarding Cinergy and the Cincinnati area.  The types of roles available with the company at present struck me as both exciting and promising opportunities.  Good luck in the continued efforts to move the company in the desired direction and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

To which I responded, ""I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address.  I'd promised him at Kenneally's that  I'd send it when I got the chance.""

Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.  I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.  Speaking of which, she and Mitch had the ""let's just be friends talk"" last week ( which I think was the right move ).

Would you mind letting me know when I have access to the curve validation file in the O:// drive, or if there's anything I need to do to secure those rights.  Currently we are actually trying to track down who has the broker quotes.

I'll bet it does belong to the other Susan.  I've never signed you up for Cingular Wireless.  I do have other PrimeCo bills from before you came to the department that I do need to complete that expense report.  We just got instructions today on how to get into the new ""upgraded"" system (XMS).  I will process these as soon as possible and pass them on to Legal for approval.  If I have any trouble, I'll let you know.

If I have to learn another password around here, I'm gonna croak.................(just kidding).

Linda, I checked this out and it is an invoice for Cingular Wireless for 80 some-odd dollars.  I do not have Cingular service; my mobile phone is from PrimeCo.
Have you had any trouble getting my PrimeCO bills processed?
Did you order any service for me from Cingular?
Just asking because I think this e-mail might have needed to go to the other Susan Scott.

Hey there,

Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the
frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks
for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in
Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend
of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get
together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was
awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could
just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh
yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a
bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have
to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!

Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you
tonight.

Sue

I can't respond to my Hotmail account on this machine.  So...

Bummer...I will be out of town the weekend of the 28th (Jazz Fest) and will
be out Friday on the weekend of the 5th.  I will be flying back that
Saturday and will be going to a wedding with most of those guys.  Do you
want me to find out if a certain one needs a date?  Hmmmm...  It's his
boss,
so I don't know how that would fly, but I'll find out.

However, I think that I would really like to be in Austin one of the next
two weekends (5/12 & 5/19) and my plans should not in any way limit yours.
Caycie and Jessica (thru 5/14) will be here and Jen pops over all the time.
And, I know that your sis would love to see you!!  Of course, I would hate
to miss you, but since you are in the jet-set I know that your schedule is
really busy.  How was San Diego?  Or, is that this weekend?

No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's Darren going to be up to as a result of this?  

Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, Austin?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.

FERC has approved FE's modifications to its market based tariff (MBT) to accomodate the provision of 1120 MW of MSG with the following changes:

1.  On the subject of billing, FERC noted that it could see no reason why the MSG customers should be treated differently than the MRT customers who recieve a bill on the 5th of the month for the previous month's usage and must pay by the 19th, giveing customers 14 days.  Thus, FE waasordered to change the billing timetable to be consistent with the MRT.  This gives us more time to make payment.

2.  FE is required to submit rate schedules which it had failed to do, covering, Service Schedules A &B, Application for Service, Form of Service Agreement, Form of Certificate of Concurrence, Saummary of Transmission and Ancilliary Service Charges and Code of Conduct.

Also in the order was a discussion of assignability since Shell argued that  MSG should be assignable from one marketer to another or to an aggregator.  FERC said that since Sec. 18.01 of the MRT provides that a customer can assign its rights and obligations with the written consent of FE which consent can not be unreasonably withheld, assignment is allowed.  

I am faxing a copy of this to Nicole and Gloria for our Houston files, should anyone want to read the order.

Please send this note to all identified participants in the Transmission Round Table-

To all Transmission Round Table participants:

Please think about this proposed project and keep involved with suggestions and information as you receive such.  Be prepared to discuss proposal at the next ""Round Table"" and offer remarks via e-mail to any appropriate Enron person, but particulars to Walter Coffer.

""Current Transmission Project""

Initial concept of Mandate and Plan of Action

1) Pinpoint restrictions in the Transmission system and then develop a strategy for profiting by mitigation or other actions.  

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.

2) Use our ""Transmission Round Table"" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.

Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.

Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.

3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.

4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)

5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.

6) Go to work now!

on your cell phone when we get to town.  It may not be until Friday

   Subject:  more seattle advice

   hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
when
   i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have
info
   on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to
try
   seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
   helpful

   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
   weekend unfortunately....

   i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
   and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
   night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
   do!

   the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
you
   never know.

   my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
   sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
believe
   me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
could
   get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

   ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
   definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
friday.
   the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
anytime
   on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
   message and ill call you back.

   very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

   oh, where are you staying?

   Hi Bonnie,

   How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
have
   been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
riding
   public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
have
   some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
One
   of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
in
   your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
   still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
   like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
   for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

   Thanks a bunch,
   Susan

"Re: ""THE"" wedding","Actually, I'm thrilled you want to drive.  I know I like to drive most of the time, but I'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion.  I think we should shoot for leaving by 8:00 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal (as long as we're on the road by 8:30 we should be fine).  I have no idea what I'm wearing yet either...oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, right?  

The trip was incredible.  My life has done an absolute about face.  Can't wait to tell you all about it.

Sorry no call last night...I passed out cold when I got home.  Also, I'm dying to hear about the Jonatha Brooks concert.  I had planned on going, but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted.  I was really wanting to see Kim Richey...I'm wearing a hole in my CD.

"I love my new job.....","Julie,

I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.

I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  

Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

"Re: packing?","I'm checking out the L'Auberge website as we speak...it sounds wonderful.  As for baseball, I'd love to stop by for a few innings on Saturday.  It sounds like fun and I wouldn't mind checking out the stadium.  I can't stress enough how flexible I am on all this stuff.  We can wait a while before deciding which is our best beach day bet.  I'll check out the spa's schedule regarding massages to see what kind of flexibility there is there.  As for the clothing I will try to remind myself SD is casual...Houston's gotten pretty sassy over the last couple of years.  I always feel underdressed when I go out here.  Thursday night sounds great...two days and counting.

Subject:	Re: packing?


great ideas and suggestions!  i'll respond in more detail later, but wanted to let you know you picked some of the best restaurants in san diego!  i'll try to gather some people to go straight out on thursday evening- that would be fun....i was going to study on saturday, but may have to rethink that if you've found saturday to be better beach weather.  i do like your plan for friday...i've asked my rooomate for spa suggestions....the one i do know of is L'Auberge resort in del mar- you can probably find info on the web and/or call them (don't have the phone number handy, unfortunately!).  i definitely think a jacket is better than a sweater- unfortunately it's quite cold today.  does usually warm up during the day, though.   do you like baseball?  i might be responsible for hosting our skybox on saturday, so we could drop by for a few innings, but if not, then i can get someone else to be in charge.....i am taking monday off of work to study all day, so it should make me much more relaxed this weekend. and i'm going to study like crazy tonight.  

there are several churches near me, so we'll probably go in del mar, cardiff-by-the-sea, or encinitas.....still working that out. but definitely plan on a run on the beach (if that appeals to you!)- i've been so horrible about working out these past several weeks.  

since san diego is pretty casual, you should be able to bring a pair of black pants or a skirt or something and have it function for both dinner out and church.....and of course, i always have sweaters and jackets, so you can always borrow something of mine.  

i'll drop you more info once i have it!

love,

Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to
put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging in
the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and I
think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various
situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance,
am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do
you suggest in the way of ""go-out"" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear
anything about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( 
figure Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in
the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)
Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we
should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.
As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with
a few suggestions... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa,
Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of
Pacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into
consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an
option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement
both religiously and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above,
in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill,
also sounded good for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and
your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight
from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what
time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out
Thursday night.

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help
out with a few suggestions.

Love,
Susan

"food for thought","once, a long time ago, i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from the Importance of Living...if it wasn't you it's not important, because the point is that i recently found them again and reread them today.  i think you should read them too, if not for the first time, then again and with fresh eyes....

""the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world would first order their national life; those who desired to order their national life would first regulate their home life; those who desired to regulate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives; those who desired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right; those who desired to set their hearts right, would first make their wills sincere; those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive at understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of things.  when the knowledge of things in gained, then understanding is reached; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere; when the will is sincere, then the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, then the personal life is cultivated; when the personal life is cultivated, then the home life is regulated; when the home life is regulated the national life is orderly; and when the national life is orderly, then the world is at peace.  from the emperor down to the common man, the cultivation of the personal life is the foundation for all.  it is impossible that when the foundation is disorderly, the superstructure can be orderly.  there has never been a tree whose trunk is slender and whose top branches are heavy and strong.  there is a cause and a sequence in things, and a beginning and end in human affairs.  to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning of wisdom.""

right now i think both of us are at the beginning, i.e. ""exploration of knowledge of things""...and i think the ""things"" in this instance refer to those ""things"" in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually.  i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches (and i think to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent those branches for you), but they will not come without the trunk...you can't jump the sequence of things.  now is the time for exploration, and i believe you are well on your way in that regard, but above all you must remember that time is the key...and that you can't rush yourself in this process.

hope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon.

SueBob

I just got a call from Susan Ginsberg at El Paso.  It seems they have heard from FERC staff that INGAA is showing up an awful lot to talk about the marketing affiliate rule and why there should not be any changes, but they wonder why, if they really are separate companies, the affiliates have not been in to talk to FERC themselves.  I think we have already heard this message, but El Paso wants to set up a group to go into FERC.  THey are setting up a conference call for next Thur with some other companies to discuss this issue.  I told them we would be in on the call (we don't have to, tho) but that we may not want to go into FERC with that group.  

Would anyone like to be on the call next week, or have any problem with my participation in the call?  Shall we talk about going to FERC to give them our position?  (or should we just tell them to read our comments)

"Re: Fwd: Re: Fwd: hola","I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory.  The retaliation/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be tempting.  My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any representative of Ted's sex like dirt.  Fortunately, my behavior was very short-lived and I completely recognized what I was doing.  I wouldn't worry about the lecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just utter flapping as in my case).  

Thanks for the compliments, but I find it's easy to be around all of your friends...that whole like attracts like thing.  As for the email from Clint, he's a cutie.  Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were you though...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, but I get the impression that you're just Clint's type and unless you have reciprocal interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.  However, if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's a great guy.  Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in a couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their feelings to me and I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same way...something that's hard for them to grasp given the fact that some flirting at some point did occur).

Well, I'm off to Vegas this weekend.  My guess is I won't be getting much sleep.  Oh well, life is tough.

hey susan-  thought you'd appreciate this funny email from Clint in London....  so in brief, my new theory is that eric gomez has had his heart broken (per ""Someone Like You"") and therefore must act like a slut to ignore the pain.  Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at the padres game.....i am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on saturday.  at first he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i do care about him (on some level), but as i drank more i LECTURE more, until he finally started walking away from me!  how embarrassing!  i am totally embarrassed that i wouldn't shut up!  even more surprised that eric sent me the email on monday.  i didn't see it until tuesday since i didn't work monday, but am bummed because i called him monday evening to get eric ang's phone number.....silly concern, but he probably thinks i was calling just to get in touch with him.  now  i will totally not make contact with him- not even respond to his email...don't need to overinflate people's egos!

i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5 or so months!! i love that you have so much fun here, and everyone always comments on how cool you are and how easy you are to be around.....everyone would be thrilled to have you back! (me especially!)  i'll watch for good fares, too!

write back whenever you can....talk to you soon-

thanks! tell them that i had a great time, also. i will be back friday afternoon. i may need to hang out at the beach to recover from the jet lag. jeff was very curious and mentioned to a colleague in london that i had very good company at the beach.  i assured him that you were not married-- he was confused by your ring-- and so was i when i first saw you cruising the halls. he thought we must be dating but i straighted him out. told him that you were all over me at the beach after he left (just kidding!)

so are you taking friday off?

Julie,

Thanks for letting us hang out with you on the beach Sat.  It was good to
see you.  All your friends are very cool.  Say thanks to Clint for me if you
get the chance.  We didn't last much longer that night, thank goodness.
I hope you had a nice Easter.  Other than the Lakers beating the Blazers it
was a pretty boring day.  Not to mention I was brain dead from the pickling
the two days before.
Have a good week.

Eric

I worked until midnight last night-- it actually wasn't so bad.  I also am feeling less stressed because my dinner for tonight was cancelled because the partner who was taking me (Mike Perrin-- do you know Hunter?  He was a Fiji our year...) got sick.  I was disappointed but relieved.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.

"RE: How could we ever forget?","Paul,

Got your message last night and since both nights work for Lisa and myself we figured we'd leave the decision up to the more finicky Alan.  

So Alan, it's all up to you...will it be Thursday or Friday?  If you're looking for a preference from Lisa or myself I think we would both be leaning more towards Thursday.  So just shoot us all back an email and let us know when.

Can't wait to catch up with you Paul.

See ya this week,
Susan

"RE: Office Visit","Hi Julie,

Thanks for resending the message.  I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel, but I wanted to run a few things by you first.  It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group.  If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading.  Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.  If all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and I will begin making all of the necessary reservations.  I look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group.

If you need to contact me for any reason, my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me...713-775-6472.

Thanks again,
Susan Scott

We look forward to seeing you.

i'm going to the grocery store (forgot some things), the dry cleaners, running and finishing up laundry detail...so that will take up a bit of time.

Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.  

Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.  

I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.

Talk to you soon,

Laura and Ed--
Attached are EES comments on the Illinois Commerce Commission inquiry into the possibility of establishing some additional requirements on retail suppliers that serve both residential and industrial customers (EPMI and EES are both ARES).  I think the comments are fine and promote a market based approach that focuses on real customer protection issues.  Gloria will keep you both informed of further developments by the ICC.

Jim, 
The Illinois Commerce Commission has initiated an inquiry into the activities of agents in the Illinois electric market with a view to organizing follow up workshops or rulemakings to regulate some aspects of agency activities. Their definition of agent includes power marketers, aggregators and resellers. I have filed Enron comments in this proceeding, which as the below e-mail suggests may set the tone of the proceedings. I am forwarding this to you to ascertain if there is ENA interest in monitoring this proceedings, and who will be the appropriate ENA party to update. I attach herewith, a copy of the comments. 
 

Thanks,
Gloria

"This weekend","Hope you had fun yesterday...I was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to Austin this weekend.  Emily, Katy, myself and possibly Lisa are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow.  We would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if Doug wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered.  Also, one of Katy's friends manages Pat Green and he's playing at Gruene Hall so we were thinking about trying to go see him on Saturday.  Drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest.

TXsscott5: had a huge debate at work yesterday
TXsscott5: is there such a thing as too much water....for consumption purposes
TXsscott5: i was battling almost everyone claiming that the law of diminishing returns applies even to good, old-fashioned water
joefreid: personally? or from a macroeconomic sense (property rights in the West, blah, blah, blah
TXsscott5: personally, as in water in-take into the human body
TXsscott5: and there is such a thing....and it can cause a condition known as water intoxication...
TXsscott5: it's so gratifying to be right ;
TXsscott5: ;-)
joefreid: yes, I buy into the law of diminishing returns.  I've heard of water intoxication and I agree with your assessment
joefreid: that doesn't mean you are right
joefreid: though
TXsscott5: why not?
joefreid: my bad...because you found info on Water Intoxification you are right.  I though you were saying b/c i agreed with you, you were right
TXsscott5: oh...ha
TXsscott5: people were attacking me...saying, ""no amount of water can be bad for you"" etc. etc.
TXsscott5: and i replied, ""at some point your body can't process the water...the system has to overload""
joefreid: too much of anything is bad for you....way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: thx
TXsscott5: i think i've scared them all know
TXsscott5: now
joefreid: Cow them into submission
TXsscott5: i always do....could be why i've heard the words, ""you're intimidating"" more than once in my lifetime
TXsscott5: oh well....i gotta be me
joefreid: not necessarily a bad thing....when used in moderation
joefreid: Law of Diminishing Returns again...it is everywhere
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: so true
TXsscott5: seriously though....i may have issues w/ challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down....i hate being wrong, but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer
joefreid: ...so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok?
joefreid: insatiable intellectual curiosity?
TXsscott5: oh, i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong...but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out...so i come out ahead
joefreid: ...I am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the ""wing"" provides lift.  The physics of it all and who in the world came up with that?
TXsscott5: that one still gets me
TXsscott5: i mean, really....how cool is that
TXsscott5: this giant heap of metal....airborne
TXsscott5: i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective
joefreid: is it and extrapolation of Bernoulli's Principle
joefreid: ?
TXsscott5: ok...engineer talking to business major
TXsscott5: heard of the principle...but couldn't define it for you 
TXsscott5: ;(
TXsscott5: :-(
joefreid: i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential (low above, high below and this ""lifts"" the wing.  But it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing, the airflow over it, etc...
TXsscott5: ok.....i'm officially impressed....my dad could talk to you for HOURS
joefreid: That is why for the longest time, maybe even still today, the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce.  Other countries would love for Boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it.
joefreid: I'm sure your father would shame me
TXsscott5: no....i doubt, but it would make for some interesting discussion

"Contracts","Theresa and Nicole,

Jay and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the Denver desk and Fed-Ex them to the Houston office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.  

Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet:

	-36169000
	-36177000
	-33084000
	-33085000
	-33038000
	-31029000
	-33171000
	-33175000
	-116388
	-903145
	-IT-601
	-41066000
	-41075000

If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.

Thanks for all the help,
Susan

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.

"Re: Austin","Hey there,

Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!  

Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you tonight.

Sue

I can't respond to my Hotmail account on this machine.  So...

Bummer...I will be out of town the weekend of the 28th (Jazz Fest) and will
be out Friday on the weekend of the 5th.  I will be flying back that
Saturday and will be going to a wedding with most of those guys.  Do you
want me to find out if a certain one needs a date?  Hmmmm...  It's his boss,
so I don't know how that would fly, but I'll find out.

However, I think that I would really like to be in Austin one of the next
two weekends (5/12 & 5/19) and my plans should not in any way limit yours.
Caycie and Jessica (thru 5/14) will be here and Jen pops over all the time.
And, I know that your sis would love to see you!!  Of course, I would hate
to miss you, but since you are in the jet-set I know that your schedule is
really busy.  How was San Diego?  Or, is that this weekend?

You can go to Gardaworld.com and then just click on photo gallery and Brenzone to see what it looks like...absolutely amazing.  It would be a fantastic trip in my opinion - Lots of great wine.  Plus, you can be the exchange rate from Pounds or Dollars to Lire.

"RE: yo","ok....i'm back at the desk.  just reread your email and realized you're actually working at the cafe tonight...cool.  

as for the apt., the first really was bound to be more of a meet-and-greet, lay the groundwork situation so maybe it's just as well is was shorter.  next week you'll be able to actually start examining things w/ her a bit more rather than merely establishing a starting point.

i was reading a bunch of my ""With God All Things are Possible"" book last night and there was a passage that just totally hit home with me which referenced Jesus' reaction to a sinner who approached him.

""he neither condoned nor condemned the sin, he understood it"".....it think this is such an important perspective to gain not only in reacting to those around you but almost more importantly to yourself. (bear in mind that this is primarily me talk'n to me, but i thought you might take something away from it as well)

like i said, i'm gonna stick around here for a while and then i will, of course, have the cell phone.  

good luck kick'n the cold.

Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta

Long time...no nothing.  How goes it?  Just wanted to drop you a line and see how the fam's doing.  Hope all is well.  We really need to grab a drink after work sometime or a late afternoon coffee and catch-up on each other's respective endeavours.

Talk to you soon,

"How are you?","Hey old married woman....what's up!?

I got your x-mas card...that was too cute.  I hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic New Year.  

I'm also glad you and Matt liked your wedding gift...I absolutely LOVED that pitcher.  I knew I wanted to get that for you the second I saw it, really too cool.  (Didn't hurt that my parents wanted to pitch in on the gift.)  

Anyway, I really just wanted to touch base and see how life's been treating you and your new hubby.  I had a good Christmas w/ family and an EXTREMELY low key New Year - which was definitely ok w/ me.

Hope to see you soon,
Susan

Subject:	ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES DEAL

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice ""retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction.""

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

"packing?","Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging in the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and I think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance, am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you suggest in the way of ""go-out"" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear anything about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( I figure Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)  Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.  As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestions... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa, Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of Pacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above, in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill, also sounded good for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out Thursday night.  

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help out with a few suggestions.

Love,
Susan

Subject:	yo

Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta

And yes, the real world emphatically sucks.  Emily's got the right idea, avoid it at all costs.  Still, work's going all right for me.  My hours have dramatically improved, which is nice, and they actually let me take time off for vacation.  I'm reserving the weekend Emily mentioned in September so hopefully I'll see you there.

wake-up call, though.....kates and kelley got here yesterday, then left
again this morn. for stockholm.  they'll be back thurs night, me, the next
night.  am excited about you (and lisa, i guess...) getting here next week.
should be fun.  haven't given up on the chance for a jaunt off, but will
have to be last min, and have to keep cking at ryanair and
www.webweekends.com for updates as they come....if you get a chance at work,
try to do some browsing....also, some annoying requests- katy forgot all the
minutemade frozen limeade she'd promised to bring for our Eagles marg party,
and the jerky from dad - suspiciously, she remembered my pocket-sized
neosporin tube......but anyways, it would be FABULOUS if you and lisa could
each cart over 3-4 tubes of the limeade wrapped in plastic
(carry-on....obviously could be ugly in non-pressurized cabin in suitcase!)
doesn't matter if thaws, but will need approx 7-10 tubes for the
festivities, plus, dad has that great turkey jerky from NB to send
along....he said he'd get it to sally, then to you somehow.  only if it's
convenient....but the limeaide would be a lifesaver!  tell lisa it's her
""rent""  for a last-min invite w/o ever asking.....any thoughts about shows
or activities you want to see?  know all the tourist stuff has been done, so
any partic. shows?  restaurants?  let me know...as i said, have been cking
on ryanair updates, but still no grt deals- must wait til newest deals come
out, so since i won't have computer in austia, must put you in charge of
cking....clearly, lisa will be of no help in this dept, so we must take this
into our own hands.....we'll see.....ok- am off.  will try to call when i
get bk to london fri- hope memorial day was fab....

If you end up taking the tube you'll walk out of the tube station and take an immediate left.  Walk roughly two blocks and then take another right onto Portland Road.  There will be a pizza place right on the corner.  You'll walk all the way down Portland road until it looks like the road ends in a cul-de-sac.  The roads actually continues on the other side of a little bricked area with benches (a place called Janie's Wine Bar will be on your immediate left).

Subject:	ENRON COMPRESSION SERVICES DEAL

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice ""retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction.""

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

We loved seeing you this weekend.  I am catatonic today, but it was a fun
night.  Thank you so much for the gift bags and the wonderful rooster and
turtle.  I love the bags and the figurines are adorable.  The kids love
their watches.  I just had to strap Mack's on for bedtime!!  He told me that
it was 7 o'clock all day today.  Thanks again and we'll see you in Austin or
Houston soon! Love, Kathy

"""THE"" wedding","Okay,  I'm in for driving together on Friday.  Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in Austin, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.  So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.  I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San Antonio.  Absolutely no more getting lost for Susan...zapps my energy.

Lisa, if there's a good place around your duplex I'd love to come see it and show you the pictures I took from your wedding...there's a great one of you and Brad dancing at the reception.

Subject:	RE: PNR questions


Mike,

I see in your emails below that you are indicating that the allocation process does not comply with the tariff. The allocation process I do not think is the problem. It is the way the rates are used today for PNR. Today, the only rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tariff rates. If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for the range of dates of the specific deal, then the rates must be loaded that way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation process. If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate, then it looks for the next level which is your posted rates, if no posted rates are found, then it looks for tariff rates on PNR. It sounds like to me that TW will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific rates for each deal sheet on a daily basis & load the total specific contract deal rate in CBS.  Please let me know if there are other problems in the allocation process itself.

Thanks Ramona

Regarding my meeting invitation..............I hope this helps.

I've had a series of e-mails with Marketing, Legal and Regulatory regarding TW PNR in an effort to finalize the process and procedures. As a result, I've learned that TW's allocation process does not comply with the tariff. (See below) Marketing wants to continue with current practices, but changes are required for the allocation process.

Mike,

I recommend that we continue to use the current practices we are using now of charging the PNR rate posted on the day service begins.  I also recommend that we continue our current practice of  using the nomination process and posted rates for PNR service.   In the future, we may choose to change those practices to one of the methods you recommended below.  It is helpful to know that that would require system changes and new language on the postings to accommodate any new change of that sort.  

Thanks for your help on this.

Sue & Kevin,

I need some help from you..............
Based on the response from Susan Scott and Glen Hass (below), 

Should TW continue the practice of charging the PNR rate posted on the day service begins or charge the rate posted daily? (Using the latter, TW's posted rates would include the text Susan provides below)
  
Should TW continue to use the nomination process and posted rates for PNR service or revert back to entering into individual purchase orders for each deal?
The individual purchase orders are not as convenient , but they provide better clarity between the parties.

TW's allocation program uses the posted and/or deal rates entered into CBS when capacity is allocated. It  does not calculate ...""the greatest total cost commitment"". System modifications are needed to determine which shipper has the greatest cost commitment.

Subject:	PNR questions

You asked:

	1.  For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days, is it acceptable to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days, or should TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance?

	Answer:  The tariff doesn't say.  I believe this is a business decision.  Would we rather charge the same rate every day, or are both parties OK with taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day?  My understanding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the same day.  I also understand that, rather than documenting the rate in a contract or other writing, we rely on our posting.  If we change our practice and start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate, I recommend at a minimum that we notify our customers in a posting.  From a legal standpoint I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet, e-mail or other writing.  While we may be indifferent (after all, Form M says the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary), documentation of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises.

	Another thing:  There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers the posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance, and other shippers the posted rate from day to day.  However, there can be no discrepancy among similarly situated shippers.  To avoid the appearance of discrimination, I'd recommend choosing one method or the other, if that is feasible from a business standpoint.  

	Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers, here are my recommendations:

	My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be something to this effect:  BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL BE CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE.  (If this looks awkward to you let's discuss a better way to say it.)

	I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes.  However, if it is possible to do an e-mail or fax, it could read:  The rate applicable to Contract No. ______ on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate posted on Transwestern's website for that day.  Another option might be just to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement; it would not have to be done for each deal.

2.  If we have the following situation:  Shipper A has parked 10,000 dth for a week and wants to move it out; Shipper B wants to ride 10,000 dth; we can only accommodate schedule activity totaling 10,000 dth -- who gets priority?

	Answer:  Shipper A should have priority because it has the greatest total cost commitment to TW in accordance with Sheet 37E of the tariff.

hi Susan,

My name is Aarati Siva, and I'm a summer analyst intern in EES (with the Load desk within Commodity Risk Management).  Priya Jaisinghani suggested I contact you when I mentioned to her that I'd like to talk to a couple of people  to find out more about Enron and its different businesses. 
 I don't know if Priya told you, but I met her when she came down to represent Enron at our school last semester (the University of Virginia).  I caught up with her a few weeks ago over lunch, which is when she suggested some analyst resources for me to speak with.  I'm a finance/economics major and hope to work here full time next year (if I get an offer!)...but I still am not sure where I'd like to work within Enron.   I was wondering if you had the time to tell me a little bit about what you're doing, and how you're liking it so far?  She told me you traded gas, and I'm eager to find out about trading opportunities, in particular, so I thought it would be wise to talk to someone currently involved with that.  If its not possible that's not a problem, I understand its a busy time for everybody just about now.  But if you could that'd be great - it wouldn't have to be long, I just wanted to get a little direction and advice from people who've worked in different places.  Thanks!

i am betting you are staying downtown or near downtown which is
perfect/. and getting around seattle is easy- you can either take bus,
or if you dont feel like it, you can always take cabs as they are
readily available in the downtown area.

you must see pike place market--- its downtown on the waterfront, where
they have fresh fish, etc/ very neat/

then there is the experience music project, an awesome museum -
literally like nothing you have ever seen before. very interesting.

for outdoor stuff, i would say Discovery Park, which is about a 15
minute drive from downtown.  it is beautiful.

write me and let me know when you and your co worker are coming (as in,
what weekend)--- i hope it is a weekend that i am planning to be here! i
would love to meet up.

of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in
your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live
in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a
research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for
restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

ok- am really planning on calling tonight.  have to admit, the movies on tv
the past two nights have sent niki and i into professional veg mode til the
wee hours....are you going to susan edwards' wedding?  i think we were all
invited- hate that i'm going to miss it- think it's going to be fun!  first
night bk to boot camp at almost 100%...not bad, but still stuck in the
beginner's grp.  looks like a bunch of people who didn't quite make it into
athletics in jr high....i feel like an olympic athlete in comparison.  won't
be such an ego boost to head back to advanced grp and last place in every
wind sprint.  am currently watching old ally mc beal re-runs.  i REALLY like
that british guy, brian, she dated for a while....damn!  he's precious.  ok-
mind is wandering.  you'll be VERY excited to hear of my latest whim- cross
stitching.  but cross stitching w/ a purpose, of course.  M & D's 30th
anniversary is in december, and thought i'd do an anniversary sampler for
it.  will prob take me that long just to do the border....ok.  am off.
again- baring any fabulous , unmissable tv options, will try to call later!

Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.

"RE: This weekend","I forgot Leigh Ann was going to be in town this weekend.  As for this evening, I think we're still on.  The movie is showing at the Angelika at 7:40 or Greenway 3 at 10:00...I'm assuming both of us would prefer the earlier movie, but there is something to be said for proximity.  What are your thoughts?  We could either take our time with dinner and then do the movie or just go to the early show and maybe grab dessert afterwards.  My guess is Emily would probably prefer the earlier time, since she may be taking off early tomorrow.

Stopped by Em's last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Austin this weekend.  She'd already talked to Katy and it sounded like Katy was interested in Austin tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.  Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.  Emily and Katy would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.  As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.

It actually meant a lot to me to have such a fun evening w/ almost total strangers, makes the prospect of moving up there a little less daunting.  You have a nice group of friends, and I will definitely draw on both yours and their expertise on where to live, etc. should I end up moving.

Subject:	Fwd: Whats Up?


KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER!  com'on.....realllly!  one
would think this email was to organize a trip to london- but nooooo...it's a
""hands off"" warning instead.  and admittedly, the bit about ""trusting me to
honor"" pulls at me and w/ anyone else, i'd snap into good behavior mode, but
then i step bk and realize how sneaky and evil (hel-lo?  who is mitch?  does
she have dibs on him as well?  how many 'dibs' are we allocated?  let me
know when you get the scoop...)what nerve!  as for the 1 line about coming
to london, katy isn't coming mid may- she's coming at the end-begin. of
june, which is much better for me, too- have school full-time til last week
of may....so, i vote you send her mid may, then come w/ kates at the end of
the month.  and, gee- do tyou think i can predict her visit?  let's see-
it'll be convenient and cheap to stay w/ me....but- perfect timing for her
to show up at my doorstep, get her extra key, then jaunt off to 'secure' her
position w/ mr.dibs....not that i'm complaining- just horribly offended that
she thinks i'm so dense as to not be able to see- and hear- her large, slow,
unoiled wheels a-turning....!  aughhhhh!  see below, obviously....

Em and I (yes, it was just the two of us in NB...oh the shame) tried to call you on New Year's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room and I assume were staying with Priyah (I know I butchered that) whose last name I do not know.  Anyway, I did talk to your Mom the day you arrived in Madras and knew you were there safe and sound w/ a new friend too boot!

Hope you're doing okay and starting to adjust to the new surroundings.  Email me when you get a chance and let me know all about your trip.

Good Luck and talk to you soon,

"Re: UGGGHHHHH","I'm just glad I'm going to be out of town for the next 3 weekends.  What pray tell will she do?  With no buffer there, will there be any reason for Mitch not to shack?  I'm curious to see how all of this plays out.  She keeps looking for signs to know whether Mitch is right or not...I told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him.  She's got such a tough life.  

Oh, my Mom was over Sunday and made some comment about Lisa always dating someone....she still denies.  Cracks me up.  Response is always,  ""I've only had two serious boyfriends.""  To which I've started to respond, ""We'll I'm batting zero and have only one legitimate first date with a guy.  In relative terms, you are a dating phenomenon.""

I definitely need this vacation,

"Re: Hi","Caycie,

I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe both you and Jen got engaged on the same weekend.  I'm absolutely thrilled for you and look forward to all the fun festivities this will warrant.  You know I think Briggs is great (I've had so much fun hanging out with him at all of these weddings) and you're obviously pretty fond of him so I can't imagine a better bit of news than that of your engagement.  I can't wait to hear all about the event (and see the ring - I'm sure it's gorgeous).

I think I'm actually going to try and come up to Austin the weekend of the 12th...from what I understand Jessica will still be in town, as will Corey, and Jen had expressed some interest in making a road trip so we'll see.

Love,
Sue

"","So did you make it in today?  Hope you're feeling better.  Wasn't sure last night if you were or weren't interested in the concert Sat. night.  Let me know because if we decide to go I'm going to buy the tickets today.  Also, Boone called about 11:45 last night to berate you for not returning phone calls or emails.  The message is on the answering machine if you want to call the apartment and listen to it (be forewarned, there is a lot of rambling).

"RE: @%$$@!!!","I know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phone.  The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continental is evil).  Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each other!  Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics definitely improve with more people.  She does want to visit with some of the Enron people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.  I figure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll just get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape to discuss my last escapade).  Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's going to be a good trip.  Let me know what you think about the Italy trip after you have a chance to look...Lisa and I have both been to Salzburg, but I don't think either of are opposed to going back.  The town is adorable and there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.

Ciao,
Sue

ok- we lose.  didn't know what to do- she was like a little terrier chewing
on my sock and would not let go.  she insisted on waking you up and MAKING
OUR PLANS!  yippee.  ok- am going to try to be upbeat.  haven't actually
traveled with lisa, maybe is not bad.  but will say this:  am NOT blowing my
stock $ savings from last 7 yrs to be bullied into shitty vacation.  i guess
she's staying w/ me- funny, she never asked.  assumed that it was ok to put
potentially 5 people into 300 sq. foot flat.  sorry- don't want to get
huffy, but was really looking forward to this, and you KNOW if the shoe was
on the other foot and she had another A&M friend coming to visit and then i
tried to descend, it would not be a warm welcome.  am imagining YOUR living
room, minus matt, ......in london.  ok, done.  will try to look up more
stuff on italy tomorrow, but honestly don't care- would just like to go
somewhere pretty and not big-city-like where there are not too many sight
seeing opportunities i will feel obligated to participate in.  maybe
dividing room rate by 3 will allow for a fancy-schmancy hotel
room....positive thoughts, positive thoughts...try to call/email later.

I talked to Pattie yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.  I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.  I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.

I spoke to Matt on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.  He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.  He wouldn't respond yesterday.  Oh well....c'est la vie.

hi there:
how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?

let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole ""looking for a job"" front. I know it can be so frustrating.

have you spoken with matt????  any more updates with that?

happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)

Subject:	Entities that do not need FERC power marketing authorization

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their primary business is as a utility, like Enron).  

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

Subject:	Entities that do not need power marketing authorization


Christi-

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or municipalities and qualifying facilities (""QFs"") must obtain power marketing authorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Federal Power Act (""FPA"") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate commerce, ""shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foregoing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as such in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific reference thereto.""

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to have rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to state agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most provisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilities making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which authorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided cost.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at market-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.  They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).  In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.  Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.  I'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,

Subject:	Happy New Year





I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or play outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Deer Valley. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny...he tipped me .50 on 2.50..ha.  The town is loaded with intense
looking film types with their dark rimmed glasses...north face down jackets,
cell phones and ski caps...its pretty funny.  This morning I went for a jog
around down town....I walked down Main st. on my way back and there are all
these people getting photographed along the street...you look at them and
try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like any other guy.
The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out their stories and
photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in this cafe and all are
being used right now..it is crazy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe

ARE YOU A BITCH????? 
Some friends were sitting at the bar talking about their professions. 
The first guy says ""I'm a Y.U.P.P.I.E, you know.... 
Young, Urban, Professional, Peaceful; Intelligent; Ecologist"" 
The second guy says ""I'm a D.I.N.K, you know.... 
Double Income, No Kids."" 
The third guy says, ""I'm a R.U.B., you know... 
Rich, Urban, Biker."" 
They turn to the woman and ask her, ""What are you?"" 
She replies: ""I'm a WIFE, you know.... 
Wash, Iron, F***, Etc."" 
A second gal answers their question before they even ask it: 
""BITCH ""So, just exactly what is a BITCH??????????"" They ask in unison. 
* B- BABE 
* I- IN 
* T- TOTAL 
* C- CONTROL of 
* H- HERSELF 
> 
So ladies, next time somebody calls you ""Bitch""...SMILE......and say Thank 
You!!!!!!!! 
MAKE A WOMAN HAPPY! 
PASS THIS ONE ON TO AS MANY WOMEN AS YOU KNOW!
