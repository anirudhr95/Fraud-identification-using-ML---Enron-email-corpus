"hey","
Susan,
Hey, just thought I'd check in.  I have done some looking and it seems like $870 is the best price I can find for a round trip, Houston to Korea.  The only catch is that the rate is a ""military"" rate.  I have NEVER been asked to show a military ID at the airport.  I have asked around and no one that I know if has ever been asked either.  I really do think you'd be safe, I'd just buy the ticket here in your name and send it on to you.  If you don't do it that way, the fares are running around $1000-1100 and up.  The price of $870 is what Chuck and I did home for Christmas and would be on Asiana Airlines.  Let me know if you are still interested in coming and what you think about the fares.
Hope you had a good time in Seattle.
-Chris

That is ok.  I totally blanked until it was too late also.

I think that if Millie decides she likes my flat than I will have her as a
roommate.  I decided I could not deal with it right then and so I told her
she did nto have to worry about it until July.  however, i think she seems
really nice and I think it would be fun.

HAve a great day.

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to
London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work
email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had
such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip
back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I
could see you and Jessica and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my
physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely
be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be
significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Millie?

   difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"Important Message","It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

"A.Word.A.Day--zugzwang","zugzwang (TSOOK-tsvahng) noun

   A position where one is forced to make an undesirable move.

[From German Zugzwang, Zug (move) + Zwang (compulsion, obligation).]

   ""Now the government finds itself in zugzwang, where every move it makes
   worsens its position against an invisible opponent ....""
   Pusch Commey, Is the Rand Racially Prejudiced?, African Business (London),
   Mar 2001.

In his classic story ""Shatranj Ke Khiladi"" (""Chess Players,"" later made into
a movie directed by Satyajit Ray), Hindi writer Munshi Premchand (1880-1936)
narrates the saga of a kingdom engrossed in playing chess, unmindful of the
advancing enemy forces. Such is the charm of this ancient Indian game.

An Italian proberb goes, ""After the game, the king and pawn go into the same
box."" A world in itself, chess mimics life in more ways than one. While quite
simple on the surface, its complexity is mind-boggling. There are more than
10120 possible moves (that's number 10 followed by 120 zeros). That is a?fairly large number once we realize that there are only about 1075 atoms
in this universe.

It attests to the popularity of the game that many of the chess words have
entered our mainstream vocabulary. This week we explore five of them. -Anu

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Your October WellsWire","In This Edition
Banking Essentials
Investment Accounts
Managing Your Financial Accounts
Managing Your Money
Back to Basics
Taking the first steps toward financial freedom starts with the 
basics. Whether you bank online, via ATM, phone, in person, or any 
combination of these, becoming familiar with the accounts and 
services your bank offers will make it easier to find the loans, 
credit cards and even home mortgages that are right for you. By 
learning what your bank has to offer, you can take advantage 
of the financial products and services that best fit your 
financial needs.
Banking Essentials
It's important to learn the features of even the most basic 
banking products. Finding the right account is easy when you've 
done the research. 
Checking and Savings Accounts
Most people have checking and savings accounts, but may not know 
that the types of accounts available vary widely. Everybody's 
financial needs are different, and that's why it's important to 
choose the account that fits the way you want to bank and enhances 
your lifestyle. 
? Checking Accounts. Do you keep a steady amount of money in your 
checking account? Is your checking account your main financial 
services account? The right checking account has it all - 
convenience, flexibility and fast, easy access to your money. 
Checking accounts give you the freedom to write checks against 
your account balance and to have access to your money through an 
ATM or online banking. And since everyone's financial needs are 
different, there are a wide variety of checking accounts available, 
including interest bearing or non-interest bearing, all of which 
are FDIC insured. From accounts that offer you free checking with 
direct deposit to low-fee student accounts to top-of-the-line 
financial relationship accounts, there's a checking account 
that fits your lifestyle. 
? Savings Accounts. Whether you're saving for a new house or a 
child's college education, the best way to achieve your financial 
goals is to put money away each month. An Automatic Savings Plan 
makes saving even easier by automatically moving a pre-determined 
amount of money between your accounts. Savings accounts are interest- 
bearing accounts with low minimum balance requirements. They are 
a convenient way to save for the future and most savings accounts 
can be used as overdraft protection for your checking account. Find 
out more about the variety of savings accounts  available to you. 
? Time Accounts (CDs)
If you're planning for a vacation or saving for the future, time 
accounts , also known as certificates of deposit, are a solid choice for your 
savings needs. Time accounts offer guaranteed rates of return for a fixed term, 
flexibility in length of investment term and are eligible for FDIC insurance. 
ATM, Check, and Credit Cards
Both ATM cards and check cards provide convenient access to your 
accounts, allowing you to withdraw cash, make deposits and transfer 
funds through an ATM. An ATM card  also offers you the ability to make 
purchases using your Secret Code or Personal Identification Number 
(PIN) at participating merchants. With a check card , you have 
expanded purchasing power at merchants worldwide that accept either 
Visa
 (or MasterCard
), depending on which logo is displayed on your 
card. Whenever you use a check card or ATM card to make a purchase, 
the purchase amount is always deducted from your checking account 
and detailed on your monthly statement for easy record keeping. 
Additionally, there are several types of credit cards , which give 
you the convenience and financial flexibility of paying for your 
purchases over time, depending on your credit limit. With all of 
these choices, there is definitely a card (or cards) that is right 
for you. 
Investment Accounts
These days, most people have some sort of an investment account. 
However, the type of investment account people choose depends on 
their comfort level and goals. Whether you're new to investing, 
experienced at managing your own investments, or simply want to work 
with a financial consultant, there are options for you. 
? Full-service brokerage. New to investing? Prefer talking to 
somebody in person? An experienced financial consultant can help. 
It's not always easy making investment choices on your own. Working 
with a financial consultant , you get the tailored advice you need to 
make informed investment decisions. 
? Online brokerage. If you prefer to manage your investments on 
your own, online brokerage  gives you the dynamic tools to manage your 
portfolio, research the marketplace, assess your opportunities and 
make the right decisions. 
? Wells ShareBuilder. With Wells ShareBuilder  you can invest in 
stocks and index shares in regular intervals, weekly or monthly. Over 
time, you will automatically build your portfolio share by share. 
With no investment minimums and low transaction fees, this 
affordable technique uses dollar-cost averaging to help you 
reach your long-term goals. 
Managing Your Financial Accounts
? Online Banking Basics
How do you access your accounts? In a branch, at an ATM, over the 
phone, or online? As many people have discovered, banking online is 
the fastest, most convenient way to access all their accounts, manage 
investments, transfer funds and pay bills - all with just the click 
of a mouse. 
? Online account access. Need to check your balance from work? Want 
to make a quick transfer between accounts but don't have time to stop 
at the bank or ATM? Online account access  lets you view your account 
balances and transactions, transfer funds, pay bills online, and 
contact customer service. It's an easy and convenient way to manage 
your accounts from your computer. 
? Online bill pay. With online bill pay, you can pay any individual 
or company in the U.S. from the comfort of your home computer, the 
office, or anywhere you have Internet access. And the money you will 
save on postage can really add up. Try this demo  to see how easy 
it is. 
Managing Your Money
If you're like most people, you work hard and strive to achieve your 
dreams. It's important to build a financial foundation to ensure you 
arrive where you want to be. Here are a few tips on how you can make 
smart decisions about your financial future. 
Taking Control of Your Finances
It's not how much you make, but what you do with your money that 
matters. Cutting out a few minor expenses can make a big difference 
in your savings. There's no better way to stay out of debt than by 
tracking your spending and sticking to a budget. A budget can help 
you control your finances, decrease your debt, and build a strong 
credit history. Where do you spend your money? Determining your cash 
flow is the first step in creating a successful budget. 
Building Your Credit and Controlling Debt
Managing credit can be a challenge. But a good credit rating is key 
to many financial decisions. Learning how to establish and maintain 
good credit  can make a big difference in your savings. Understanding 
how to manage your debt can empower you to take charge of your 
financial future. The quality of your life is directly linked to how 
well you manage your credit and debt.

If we all did this our problem would be solved.    Walt  

The message below was sent to an old AF buddy who forwarded it on to me with
the invitation to disseminate as widely as he saw fit. I send it on to you
with the same invitation... It offers some pretty good ideas.. 
********************************************************** 
My name is John Burnett. I am a DC-10 Captain for FedEx. I am also a Police
Officer for the Memphis Police Department. 

My purpose in writing this is to share some of my thoughts regarding actions
a pilot might consider when faced with a modern-day hijacker. These thoughts
are ""outside-the-box"" when it comes to the way we've all been trained.
Neither the FAA or our companies will suggest these techniques or implement
them as a part of our normal training cycles. They couldn't for fear of
lawsuits. 

I am distributing this via e-mail to buddies I've flown with. I'm asking
them to send it to their circle of friends within the industry, and for you
to send it to yours. I know most of us have e-mail, and I hope this reaches
the next to face the horror of some religious fanatic onboard. 

We have all had ""training"" in what to do in case of a hijacking; try to keep
the hijacker calm, make him think you're doing what he wants, take him where
ever he wants to go, etc., etc., etc. Save your passengers, your crew, and
your aircraft. 

In an emergency, you will revert to that training. When our unfortunate
peers were faced with the screams of the Flight Attendants and hijacker's
demands to open the cockpit door, their training probably made them open the
door. When the fanatics made demands, their training told them to comply as
best they could. I can only wonder what their thoughts were as they left the
cockpit and were tied up in the back of the plane; what they thought as they
descended over New York.... 

I hope the fanatics had to kill them in their seats and drag their dead
bodies out of the cockpit. But, I bet they did as they were trained to do ..

As you look back over recent hijackings, FedEx, and Egypt Air, and now the
September 11th hijackings, you see a perpetrator who, for one reason or
another wants to take over the airplane and kill himself. Each of these
hijackers, except for the FedEx incident, were successful. They took over
the airplane and killed everyone onboard. 

If you're following the news programs today, you hear a lot about how we
could let these hijackers learn to fly. You would think if knowing how to
fly would guarantee a successful hijacking, Auburn Calloway (the FedEx
hijacker) would have been a hijacker success story. 

Calloway had been a Navy pilot, a martial arts student, a fellow FedEx crew
member, and he took all the weapons he needed: hammers, knives and a spear
gun. He didn't have to overcome any Flight Attendants or demand they open
the cockpit door. He just went back to his bag, took out his hammer came
back into the cockpit and started crushing skulls. 

The crew members on that flight didn't worry about Flight Attendants, they
didn't worry about passengers. All three pilots left the cockpit and fought
a hand-to-hand, life-or-death battle. 

To survive today's hijacker, you cannot worry about your passengers; you
cannot worry about your Flight Attendants. You must develop a mind-set that
everyone onboard - including yourself - is already dead. Because, if the
hijacker is successful in taking over your airplane, not only you, your
crew, your passengers and your aircraft are lost, but thousands on the
ground are at risk. 

One of the reasons the FedEx crew survived, is the extraordinary actions of
the co-pilot. Although he had brain injury, the co-pilot took the DC-10 and
immediately executed a half-roll. This maneuver took the hijacker off his
feet as the Captain and S/O were struggling with him. 

During a point in the maneuver, the hijacker, Captain and S/O were thrown
back behind the cockpit door. When he righted the airplane, the F/O then
left his seat and joined the fight in the galley area of the plane. It was
only after the Captain determined the hijacker was subdued, he returned to
the cockpit and flew the airplane to landing. 

Very few of us have had to confront true evil. Fewer still have seriously
considered taking the life of another human being. I believe this is the
reason the FedEx crew did not kill their attacker. The crew's heroism that
day is beyond belief. And any action that leads to a safe landing and
recovery cannot be argued with. 

But, when the Captain left the F/O and S/O, thinking the situation was under
control, he was mistaken. The F/O and S/O had sustained serious,
life-threatening injuries. The hijacker had not. As the Captain flew the
aircraft, the hijacker, who had surrendered, began the fight anew. 

As the airplane landed, the hijacker was just moments away from overcoming
the two crew members. 

I mention this for your consideration. I would suggest that you make a
conscious decision to kill anyone who tries to take your airplane from you.

Today we are at war. The hijacker who comes through your cockpit door is
going to kill you and everyone onboard. So, how do you do that? What weapons
are available to us as pilots? 

The intercom. Command that all men come forward and fight with the
hijackers. You have many able-bodied men onboard. They are sitting in shock
not knowing what to do. Command that they come forward and help you kill
your attackers. And, they will come. 

The airplane itself. Get the hijackers off their feet. Go into an immediate
dive to float them to the ceiling. Then execute a 6G positive maneuver and
hope they hit their head or break their back as they hit the floor, galley
shelf, etc. 

Pull the fire handles, shut the start levers and turn the fuel valves off.
If you lose the battle, at least the airplane won't be used as a guided
missile on a kamikaze mission. With luck, maybe these guys didn't learn how
to do an in-flight restart. Then leave the cockpit - all of you, and kill
your attackers - don't believe it when they surrender - don't be nice to
them - KILL THEM. 

Flare Gun If your airplane has one, the Captain might consider making sure
it's loaded and secured next to his bag. I can think of nothing more
satisfying than watching a ball of burning phosphorous embedded into a
fanatic's gut. 

The crash-axe. I would suggest you have your co-pilot take it from it's
holder and secure it next to him so he has it immediately available. Makes
an excellent skull crusher. 

Your flashlight. The FAA use to require a 2 cell. A 3 cell Mag-Light makes
an excellent weapon. If your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floor
writhing in pain, crush their skulls. 

Your stolen hotel bic pen. Drive it into an attacker's eye, ear, throat, or
into the area just under the jaw bone. That's a particular interesting place
to drive it, because when he opens his mouth to scream, you can read ""Hyatt""
sticking there. 

Your hand and fingers Drive your fingers into his eyes and try to feel your
fingernails scrape the back of his eye sockets. Scoop the eyeballs out. It
will confuse the hell out of him when he finds himself looking at his shoes
as they dangle there on the ocular nerves. 

Your teeth. Remember Hannibal Lecter. Eat a nose, a cheek, or a finger. And
keep eating. Attack with all viciousness. A piranha is a small fish, but
it's greatly feared. A hijacker is not expecting you to eat him and it might
make him forget why he got on your airplane to begin with. It will, at
least, impress his buddies. 

Now here's my wish-list of things the FAA could do to help, especially in
this time of war. 

Arm the Captain 
The battle is not going to require any long shots. A small revolver would be
a good choice. It would hold off the attackers long enough for you to
disable your aircraft. 

If the attackers claimed the red package they were holding was a bomb, I'd
shoot out the door glass and hope the door would be ripped out and the
hijacker and his package would be sucked out. And hey, I if I got sucked out
with him, I'd try to fly my body to the hijacker look in his face and laugh
at him all the way to the ground. 

Invite The Police To Man The Jump Seat
Police are always looking for something free. Donut shops use to be a
favorite target for robbers - until they started giving donuts to the
Police. Robbers don't rob donut shops anymore. I would suggest each Police
Department send the FAA a list of the best shots on the department and those
guys and their guns would be welcome on my airplane. 

Fill every vacant seat with armed Police - give them a donut - and tell them
to shoot anyone who gives your Flight Attendant any shit. 

Stop this silly no-knife rule. Make it public. Tell the public they're
welcome to bring their pocket knives onboard. Then everyone will bring them.

So when you make your Intercom call to the passengers for help, you'll have
a dozen or more knife wielding helpers trying to make sure their new Gerber
tastes fanatics blood. There are even a few of them who'd want to keep the
fanatics ears as souvenirs. 

None of us is immune. Take some time and consider your actions if this event
should ever happen to you. My prayer is none of you ever have to face this
kind of decision. 

Best of luck to you, and may God Bless.

"A.Word.A.Day--purple passage","purple passage (PUR-puhl PAS-ij) noun, also purple patch, purple prose

   1. A brilliant passage in an otherwise dull and uninspiring work.

   2. A piece of writing marked by ornate, florid style.

[From Latin pannus purpureus (purple patch), a phrase used by poet Horace in
his Ars Poetica (The Art of Poetry) to suggest a patch of royal fabric on an
ordinary cloth.]

   ""Page after page is filled with drunken quarrels with his wife; with lies,
   infidelities, religious doubts, homosexual yearnings and, above all, with
   his daily, desperate search for a bottle. Interspersed among these dreary
   horrors are purple passages about his love for his children, his dog and
   his fine house.""

"Kevie's First Day of School","
Hi kids.  Kevie started school this week, and he moved closer to campus.  His new contact information is:
 
2635 Portland Street, Apartment 5
Los Angeles, CA 90007
 
(213) 764-0150
 
Kevie now lives in South Central (aka Da 'Tto aka the Ghetto), so don't break your necks coming visit his new place.  He's always up for hanging out away from his new location, though.
 
Actually, the new place is not too bad.  I have a roommate who I have not yet met, but the apartment is adequate.  The bars on the windows are a lovely touch.  For those CU alums in the LA area, I'm planning on hitting Grunyuns in Manhattan Beach on Sunday night to watch the Buffs game, so hopefully you other kids can make it, as well.  Talk at ya'll later.

"Code of Ethics -- What Exactly Did I Agree To?","

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

""It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable.""
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"RE: Saturday Night","
Hey Girls,
I've been to Baba Yega a few times, just there last week, nothing too exciting.   I would love to try La Vista. Never even heard of that.

Is anyone else as ecstatic as me that today is Friday? Yahooooooo.

Girls,

We are planning to meet at Yvette's (2035 Milford) at 6:30. I believe everyone recalls how to get there. I have 2 places in mind, but please bring other suggestions. I just figured none of us have been to either of these: 

1. Baba Yega
http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/9842445/

2. La Vista
http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/11424176 

Heather, 
email me and let me know if you would like me to pick up your t-shirt for tomorrow for you. Also, we are supposed to be at the SSK House at 8 am and it is right down the street from me so let me know if you would like to go together.

see you all soon,
lisa

"Re: Holiday Weekend","Hey. 
Very interesting weekend.  Whistler was amazing.  Danny and DJ were supposed to go home sunday morning, but they didn't leave.  They called sunday and we went out.  Tons of fun.  I was dancing with dj and I talked them into staying another day.  We skied all day monday and they left.  It is a bit weird, I still don't know if dj is really that interested.  I really thought so on sunday (dancing, etc), but hard to tell when we were skiing.  Maybe because danny was there that it was a bit weird.  I will see dj at a party sat. night so more story later. 
I will get the name of the army guy.  It is Josh, but I always have a hard time remembering his last name... 
Any news from Seattle co? 
bye.

I moved, ergo I now have a new number.  512-502-2416.  Some of you will notice that is the same number as Andy Lorino.  Well, you're right.  We have decided to stop fighting the feeling and have reunited as roommates.  Not since the Fall of 1995 at the much ballyhooed Moore Hill Dormitories (aka Club Mo' Hill) has there been this much blatant towel popping.  Feel free to celebrate my return to the Castle or as Alex refers to it, The Royal Court, in whatever manner you see fit..  My cell phone is still the same 512-940-3821.

"cigar box purses","
Hi girls, 
My friend Lynne launched her website last week for her cigar box purses that she designs and creates herself.  A few of you had asked about mine and I  just wanted  to pass it on in case anyone was interested and to try to help her get started.  Very similar one are selling for much more at Tootsies for $300.   I am getting one for my sister-in-law for Christmas--they make great Christmas & b-day gifts!!  Email me if you have questions!  
Pass this on if you want to...I know she would be grateful. 
Hope everyone is doing well!! 
Ashley

Dear Friends, 
As you may be aware, I recently began designing and creating my own 
line of purses made from cigar boxes.  While this began as a small, 
personal project for my own enjoyment, I quickly found encouragement 
from friends, associates, and even total strangers who expressed 
interest and enthusiasm for the designs. 
And so, it is with great excitement -- and many thanks to my friends 
-- that I introduce you to my new web site, www.madebylynne.com. 
Here, you will find a collection of my latest cigar box purse designs. 
Please pass this message along and visit the site as often.  Made 
by Lynne cigar box purses are fun to wear and make wonderful gifts 
for birthdays and holidays. 
I would love to hear from you with any questions or suggestions you 
have, and I hope you find something you'll like! 
Sincerely, 
Lynne 
Made by Lynne 
Lynne Renshaw

"Wedding Details","
Hi Girls,
I'll be Mrs. Susan Williams in 8 DAYS!  I'm so excited and nervous and stressed all at the same time.  This has been a hectic week not only with wedding errands but also trying to get my life wrapped up before I take off for three weeks.
Before I leave town, I want to make sure you all know what's going on 
next weekend. I think most of you (with the exception of Katie) will be 
getting in town on Friday.  If anyone will be in Park City by 11:00 am on 
Friday, I'd love for you to come to the bridal luncheon my grandmother is 
having for me.  If you can make it, let me know.  Friday night I've got the
rehearsal at the church at 5:30.  The rehearsal dinner starts at 7:00 
pm at the Marriot.  Dinner will be very casual.  You may want to wear or 
bring something with long sleeves because dinner is outside and it gets 
chilly at night (low 60's) in Park City.  After dinner, it will be time to ditch the families 
and head to Main Street where we will have our choice of two or three bars 
-all very laid back hole-in-the-wall type places.
On Saturday morning, I would like to have breakfast with all of you.  I
want to spend some qualit! y time with you before the day gets hectic.  
The location is to-be-announced.  I'll scope out a good breakfast place 
when I get to Park City.  Unfortunately, we'll have to eat early - around 
9:30am -so if any of you have to much fun on Friday night, I'll know why  you
aren't there ; )
The wedding will be at 3:00pm.  The church is on Main Street (at the 
top of the hill).  The parking situation is kind of confusing  because you 
can't park on Main Street and the parking lot is on the street that runs 
behind the church.  You may want to check the church out ahead of time so you 
know where it is.  The ceremony will be approx 1 hour.  The reception is at
Stein Eriksen Lodge which is up the mountain a few miles.  It doesn't 
start until 5:00 which gives you some time to kill between the wedding and
reception. This will give Eric and I time to take pictures at the 
church wi! thout having to miss any of the reception.  I figure by the time you
freshen up, drive up to Stein Eriksen (which is a beautiful drive up 
the mountain) and  you can have a  drink at the bar it will be five 
o'clock.
After the reception, you are on your own....
Now my request....Can everyone let me know when they are getting into 
town and where they are staying?   I've got that information for most of 
you but I just want to verify.  Also, Kelly and Laura - if your husbands 
want to play golf on Friday morning with Eric and his friends, let me know.  
FYI - If anyone wants to treat themselves to a message,manicure/pedicure,etc.
while in Park City the number for the Belle Salon is  (435)655-8250.  
My mom and I leaving on Monday.  If any of you want to get in touch 
with me, my cell phone is the best place to reach me (832)515-3066.  
I can't wait to see all of you next weekend!  I'm so excited that all of you are coming to the wedding.  Each of you is very special to me and it means so much to have you there on my wedding day.
Love,
Susan

"whistler!","
hi
just booked a room  (a studio actually) for whistler on feb 16, 17, 18, and 19th... we had to book 4  nights although we are staying only 3 nights. got a pretty good deal considering  we get a kitchen, it's ski in and ski out, etc. will be so fun... i am going  with my friend ali that i work with, and her roommate sam. they are both super  cool
we have room for one  more person. i know it's a stretch, but since i knew you were interested in  heading to whistler at some point and was going to see if you would want to come  with us.
we would leave on  saturday the 16th for whistler and come back to seattle on tuesday the 19th...  (monday is presidents day ). it is going to be great fun! presidents day weekend  is crazy in whistler, they think of it like christmas time as it is as busy as  christmas time or busier. tons of people. im so excited.
 
i know you will be  looking for jobs, etc. maybe you could make a trip back up to seattle coincide  with a fun trip to whistler!
let me know what you  think
 
bonnie
price is: 299  Canadian a night times 4 nights
so total is 1200  Canadian
divided by 4 (if you  came, there would be 4) is 300 canadian each, which is about 212.00 US... NOt  bad for 3 night stay

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/>

o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

"Work Hours","Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

"hey","
Susan,
I mailed your tickets today.  They said that the fastest I could get them there is 7-10 days.  We should be able to make it, just keep checking your mail.  Your itenerary is as follows:
Tuesday, August 14
IAH to SFO    9:20am - 11:15am on Continental 531
SFO to Korea 1:00pm - 4:50pm on Korean Air 24, you will arrive on Wednesday, August 15
Sunday, August 26
Korea to LAX   3:00pm - 10:30am on Korean Air 
LAX to IAH       12:20pm - 5:49pm on Continental, you will arrive back in Houston on Sunday, 26th
Anyway, I think that's it.  I hope the itenerary is ok.  As far as packing I would bring clothes for hot, humid weather (about like Houston).  Nothing we do is very dressy.  I would say a nice shorts outfit or skirt is about as dressy as it gets here.  Wear comfortable, and shoes you really don't care about.  The monsoon season may be ending soon, but the streets are disgusting year around.  Bring your running shoes and I will try to keep you training for the marathon.  There is an ATM on post here that we can use free of charge, so don't worry about cash too much.  You can always write us a check.  We can also cash a check for up to $300/day.  Definitely do not change any money.  There are some places around here that give pretty good rates.  I would pack light and bring an extra suitcase.  You may want to buy some pottery here, or some fragile items so make sure you have extra room on your carry on.&n! bsp; Of course there's always mailing things, too.
There is a DMZ tour on the 18th, 21st, 23rd, and 25th.  Probably one of the Saturdays would be better for Chuck.  If we do go somewhere, we should plan on going the first weekend you are here.  That DMZ tour on the Saturday before you leave would be a long day, but you don't fly out until 3:00 the next day, so I think we could do it if you are game.  Can't wait to take you around here and you can see what we've been doing the past year here!  Have a good weekend!
-Chris

"yo","So i was kind bummed after talkin to ya on IM.  I'm at DV now..about to
start work.  You know...we have both made a lot of progress.  I'm glad we
have been there for each other thru all of this.  Maybe I'm bummed that when
I made the comment you immediately thought the worst...not that you see us
going back to where we were..but that it brought things back so quickly and
that perhaps you could see you or me reverting back to old ways.  And that
part of my life still feels like a fresh wound. I realize that I am still
struggling with things..and while I respect that I have come far...I know I
still have to make good choices on a daily basis with my life and live with
integrity.  Coming back to H will be very interesting for me...I can only
hope for the best and that the experience of being away and having time to
think has made a difference for me.
Take care, I know you are sick and out of sorts today. HOpe you feel better,
Mo.

"so they say NEVER SAY NEVER. . .","I swore I would be one of those people who said never and really meant it.   
Well, I guess ""they"" are right . . .     
Clay and I have some news.  (No, I am not pregnant.)  But, we are buying a  
house in Dallas.  We close on it two days after my arrival in London.   
Thankfully, Clay will still be here.  We will rent it out over the next year  
while we are away.  Our move in date will be sometime next summer, depending  
on our tenants' situation.   
So, about the never say never part.  The house is in south Highland Park.   
Gasp!  We never expected to buy a house this soon.  And, I NEVER--I repeat  
NEVER-- expected that we would move to Highland Park upon graduating from law  
school, if EVER!  In fact, it was a condition of our marriage--I knew that we  
were going to end up in Dallas, but I made Clay promise that we would not  
have to settle in the Park Cities.  He promised, crossed his heart, hoped to  
die, and the whole bit.  All summer, we have been neighborhood shopping in  
Lakewood and East Dallas, an area that is close to downtown with wonderful  
homes and a sort of Austiny-feel.    
We spent some time checking out real estate cites on the web during our  
down-time at work, on a strictly just-for-fun basis.  We loved looking at  
older homes.  We dreamed about eventually getting something that was very  
livible for the time being but that would be really fun to update and  
restore.  Independently, we both came across a house in south east Highland  
Park (near the McKinney and Knox Henderson area) that was built in 1925 in  
the Craftsman style--our favorite.  We drove by it and checked it out on the  
internet for about three weeks.  Finally, we decided to call up a realtor and  
go see it.  We immediately fell in love--wood floors, beautiful original  
fixtures and ""rookwood"" fireplace, 9 foot ceilings, great backyard, etc.     
During the three week period, I had a huge and slightly dramatic internal  
debate about living in this area.  Would this mean I was destined to a life  
of suburban-driving, PTA morning, bubble head-ism???  Would we ever be able  
to escape our parents who live merely 5-7 minutes away?  Was I, deep-down,  
really a total snob?  If not, would I become one?  Would I have to go to the  
neighborhood Tom Thumb?  Would I become my mother?  
The bottom line was that we loved the house--the craftsman style lets us to  
combine Clay's desire for traditionalism and my love for modern design.  (In  
other words, it's a place where my red leather couch and his stuffed deer  
head might live comfortable together.)  Also, we really loved the location (6  
minutes from Downtown; right by our favorite restaurants and bar spots; and  
very close to the Katy Trail--Dallas' jogging biking trail).  So, I decided  
that we could make  Park Cities life work. . . I would just have to  
concentrates on the things that I always have said I WILL do, rather than the  
things I have said I would NEVER do.  I will invest in the lives of needy  
people; I will keep painting; I will remember that people, instead of things,  
make the world go 'round.   
After much prayer and consideration, Clay and I put down a REALLY low-ball  
offer on the house.  We negotiated for about a week, and the sellers finally  
accepted our offer.  We feel terribly blessed, and our prayer is that our  
home can be put to use for God's purposes.  (And, perhaps, a TX-OU party??)   
I am thankful for a husband who was fortunate enough to save every penny he  
ever earned and every little birthday check he ever received--and for a  
father-in-law who helped us get an excellent interest rate.   
So, that's the news . . . let the making fun of Jessica begin . . . I  
certainly deserve it.  Too bad I am leaving the country in a matter of  
days!!!    
Hope you guys are doing well.  I will have email in London, so shoot me one  
whenever possible!  You can reach me via Clay's cell phone until Friday  
(214)649-6914.  Sorry this message was so long.  Much love and big hugs to  
you all. 
Bate :)

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Pretty cool...","The following is a web address of a magazine based in Whistler,
Canada. A woman that I work closely with, Janet Love Morrison, is
a huge human rights activist and during December's semester
break she traveled to Burma.  Her article is the 1st in a series of 4
and is the feature article, titled ""Following the Path of Aung San
Suu Kye.""

i thought it was rather impressive and so is she; I truly admire her
courage.

Take a look as soon as possible... its the feature of the week and
may not be up much longer. I will let you know when her next is
published and posted.

Ed,

To recover email, the person will need to submit a request to Roberto DeLeon in IT Security.  It will probably require the approval of that persons supervisor, Phillip Allen in this case.  I believe the access will be temporary, and it may be monitored.

Keith should be able to work through this process directly with Roberto.

Subject:	Curve Validation



Ed, I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand with regards to the curve validation project.

Project Progress:

John McKay and Sandra Brawner have completed validating the curves for the east.  PWC has a programmer who is working with Brad and me to see if he can upload the quotes from the electronic quotes we received as well as the reshaped curves that John and Sandra have prepared.

Joe and Troy have just about completed entering the quotes for Permian, Ship Channel, and Waha for the Texas desk.  However, they still need to shape and validate the curves.  

Denver and Kevin have begun working on entering the quotes for the central desk.

On the west we ran into a problem with retrieving the quotes.  Apparently Keith Holst had all the quotes electronically in his email.  However, when the Netco people were converting over to UBS, Enron's IT people destroyed all email that was sitting in the inboxes of these employees.  I've already checked with IT and they have assured me that there is no way to recover that data.  Susan has been working with Keith to see if he had sent any of these emails to others or saved them on his hard drive and thus, she has been able to recover at least part of the days.  Currently, we have quotes for Dec. 12 - 21 and Dec. 31 - Jan. 8.  All other days we are still missing data on.  This process took most of today and Susan will begin working on the quotes that she currently has tomorrow.  



Personnel Issues:

John Arnold was suppose to be back in the office today.  When he did not show, another call was put into him today.  I have not heard back on the status, but will check in the morning.

Both Russell Murrell and Martin Cuilla are suppose to be in tomorrow.

Khymberly has assured me that there isn't much likelihood of Jim Schwieger coming in at all.

Karen Scott needs to take this Friday off.  She had already booked a flight and was to have a long weekend with family.

Kevin Ruscitti will be taking off all of next week.  He and his wife had booked a trip to Mexico some time ago and he feels that this may be the only vacation he gets this year.  He has assured me that he will be here the rest of this week and the last week of February to help in whatever way he can.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kathy

Great to hear from you! Glad to see we have a connection. What do you do
for work nowdays? Curiosity has me. You are, of course, always welcome to my
tiny little dormitory/flat at anytime. Also, I am travelling as much as
possible around Europe and the former Eastern Bloc countries. I am trying to
find a few business opportunities, etc. etc....so, if you want something
""different"" look no further.
I DO have instant messenger so look me up. :) This will be a good way to
stay in touch. I will be in the US from the 19th of Dec. through the 27th.
Half the time will be spent in Houston with Cara and the other half (at
Christmas--imagine that) will be with my parents.
Met Cara in New York this weekend. It was a grand time. We wanted to see one
another and we figured that NY was the best compromise for us in terms of
distance, availability, etc. Saw the devastation briefly and now I want Rudy
Giuliani to run for Prez. More on that later. :)
Will you be in Houston the 19th through the 21st of December? Lunch perhaps?
Also, Thanksgiving I will be here with Cara. You are more than welcome at
anytime now later or a few months from now.
OK, I am rambling as I haven't slept in 24 hours thanks to the flight from
NY. Drop a note as you have time.
Best,
Tobin

Hello, everyone! I hope that you had a fine holiday weekend! Mine was
great!!

Several committee members have expressed an interest in learning more
about the events that lead to and resulted from the unexpected working
gas storage number reported a few weeks ago in the AGA American Gas
Storage Survey. At the committee's request, the following is a brief
message from Chris McGill, managing director of policy analysis,
regarding this activity. Please review the material below and attached.
By the end of this week or early next week, I will forward to you the
summary referenced in the final paragraph below for your comments and/or
concerns. Thank you. Have an awesome day!

To: AGA Underground Storage Committee Members:

Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update on the recent
activities of AGA's American Gas Storage Survey (AGSS). Certainly, the
voluntary survey and resulting estimates of working gas in storage for
the nation would not be possible without your help and support. There
are three issues I would like to cover in this message, including the
recent revision of working gas, an issue of continuing the reporting and
current procedures and methods.

Regarding the recent report and subsequent revision of working gas in
storage for the Consuming Region East, please know that we continue to
follow our procedures for data collection, verification and
distribution. Several weeks ago, we flagged several survey submittals
that seemed different from traditional patterns in the eastern region
for this time of year. Follow-up to the submittals was set in motion,
however, were not fully resolved until days after the Wednesday posting
period. It is our policy to consider eliminating certain data
submittals, if questions arise about the validity of the data. In this
case, inclusion of the data or elimination of the data from the
computational spreadsheets did not change the fact that a very low net
build would be reported for the nation. Because of that we opted to go
forward with our estimates and continue to pursue our verification
efforts. Simply put, we don't make up numbers for companies when we have
an actual report in hand just to create a final estimate of working gas
changes that fits more closely with market expectations. What turned out
to be a clerical error in the data reported to us was discovered and a
revised survey submitted. Our revision of the estimates of working gas
in storage for the eastern region and the total US came one week later
at our normal reporting period, as is our stated policy for distributing
revisions to the public.

The fact is that we have revised our data about 25 times in the past 7.5
years (or about 400 weekly reports). Our accuracy can be clearly
documented by comparing the AGSS estimates to that of EIA. The attached
slides do just that, as well as show the current level of working gas
compared to the prior five-year average. What seems to have developed in
the natural gas market, particularly among traders, is a lack of
tolerance between what we report and what the market expects. In order
to continue our reach for consistency, we are reviewing our methods and
procedures to ensure that they continue to reflect the best practices of
completing a report such as the weekly estimates of working gas. Our
evolving methods and procedures issue brief is attached. Any comments
you have on the stated procedures or regarding this memorandum, in
general, can be directed to me.

Finally, the issue of whether we continue to report the estimates of
working gas publicly remains one to be considered by the AGA Board of
Directors. Like all projects at AGA, the AGSS come under periodic
scrutiny for its value to the members and to the gas market in general.
However, like many real-time information sources, the sequential data
set has become sensitive over time. Please be alerted to the fact that a
summary is being prepared by AGA for presentation to board members on
this issue. It is our intention to copy the Underground Storage
Committee on the documentation that is distributed. It seems likely that
if AGA discontinues the weekly reporting of working gas that some other
entity (federal or otherwise) will pick it up. Again, if you have
comments on this memorandum, the attachments to this memo or the AGSS
summary to be presented to the AGA Board (not attached but expected to
be copied to you soon) please make them to me or to the appropriate

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Best Offers I have sniffed out!

For those of you longing to return to nature, Interior Secretary Gale Norton
announced that  all entrance fees to national park areas will be waived during
Veterans Day Weekend, November 10, 11 and 12, 2001, to allow Americans the
opportunity to seek solace and inspiration from the Nation's parks, monuments
and memorials. Demand is expected to be high for camping/RV spots so
reservations, at those parks that require them, are recommended to ensure a
site.  With the exception of a few parks in Hawaii, Florida and California,
expect tent camping to be on the chilly side.  Remember that leading hotel
chains like Marriott also have properties in or near the parks for travelers
who don't want to get that close to nature!  For park location information
visit: http://www.nps.gov/parks.html

Airlines continue their deep discounts but remember too that they are cutting
capacity system wide so those seats on sale now may not be available too much
longer.  The wise traveler will purchase now and watch fares.  If they do go
down, request a voucher for the difference.  You won't get a refund per se but
you will have a year to apply the voucher to another flight.

Many carriers have discounted award travel as much as 25%.  On Northwest, that
20,000-mile domestic award is available at 15,000 miles for a short time and
European and Asian destinations have also been discounted substantially.
Consider cash and miles combinations as well.  All carriers have added award
seats to flights, so now is the time to cash in those miles.

Finally, virtually all airlines and hotels are allowing their frequent
flyer/guest members to donate miles or points to relief efforts.  If you have a
few thousand miles in an account you may never use, donating them will allow a
volunteer to fly free to New York or wherever they are needed.  There is no tax
advantage in donating, only satisfaction!

See you on a flight soon,


Bob

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

"Management Changes","
As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

"Re: (no subject)","Susan:
Great to hear from you. I have been back in England the last week. Things are
going along fine. I have quite a bit of work to be done in the forthcoming
weeks but nothing to intolerable. I find that if I keep up with it, things go
just fine. Spent some time prior to Christmastide in Sweden and Finland. I
figured it was time to see the family roots. Loved Stockholm but found
Helsinki to be a bit too close to St. Petersburg. Of all the places I have
visited as of late, Edinburgh and St. Andrews still have my heart though.
I am sorry to read that Enron has had more than its fair share of trouble.
Sure, the vindictive side of me likes to see some people suffer and for that
I feel bad, but what's worse are the folks who have families to support, etc.
I feel for them. I would very much like to hear of you possibilities in the
Northwest (Seattle?). You aren't going to work for the Russell Company or
some other institution up there are you? :)
If you need anything let me know. That's one are of the country that I DO
have connections with. How are things in the man department? Is this what
might be part of taking you there? As for me, Cara and I are doing fine,
though we are tired of sitting on planes for 10 hours at a time everytime we
want to see each other. Actually, I think we are getting really serious. I am
going to ""talk"" with her dad in February no less. Kind of scary but exciting
all the same. More on that later.
Well, That's enough of my rambling. As I indicated before, if you ever want
to come over you have a place to set your hat and if you need anything in
Portland or Seattle, let me know.
Best to you,
Tobin
p.s. please send your parents a greeting for me.
p.p.s. Guess ""Who's Coming to Dinner?"" No, not Sydney Potier, Ben Freeman.
Called me this week and wants a place to stay for the next couple of nights.
He arrives on Monday. More later.....

FERC Agenda Eyes Tightening Of Pipeline Affiliate Rules
By Bryan Lee

07/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal energy regulators are scheduled to act next week on new rules affecting natural gas pipeline affiliate dealings.
Sources say the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is debating action at next Wednesday's open meeting to tighten up rules prohibiting pipelines from providing market-sensitive information to marketing affiliates. 
FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their gas-marketing affiliates. 
Similar rules are in place on the electric side for vertically integrated utilities with marketing units competing in wholesale power markets. 
The changes under consideration stem from the commission's investigation of El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s (EPG) controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into California, according to sources. 
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for California's dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year. 
The proposed code-of-conduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline industry in the 1980s. 
FERC's rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't address the pipeline's power marketing affiliates. The commission is looking to expand the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates, sources said. 
These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the conditions FERC imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). 
The commission approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger, contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates. 
The planned rule changes would apply to electric utilities with pipeline investments, such as CMS Energy (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and American Electric Power Co. (AEP). It is unclear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements, such as the one between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and privately held Koch Industries. 
But the largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants. 
For example, El Paso, Williams Cos. (WMB) and Enron Corp. (ENE), represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nation's top power marketers and merchant power plant developers. 
One FERC source described the order scheduled for commission vote next week as ""a work in progress,"" while another said the matter is in such a state of flux that ""it might not be safe to write anything yet.""

Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday.  I will ask though.  You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and leaving Korea on Sunday).  The total air fare should be $962.  Shoot me a quick e mail if this is not ok.  Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing your tickets this afternoon.  Thanks!

"hey","hey sue,

glad to hear you enjoyed the trip to tennessee. it sounds extremely
relaxing. you don't sound too certain about the job in seattle. are
you not thrilled about it? if not but you really want to be in seattle,
maybe you could take it on the hope that you may find something
better in a couple of months. have you been thinking about the
possibility of tennessee? have you been looking for jobs outside of
the energy industry?

$350 is great. i told my mom to be expecting you to drop by. if
shes not there you can tape it to the back door. also, my mom
said you dropped off the vacuum cleaner... thanks so much.

gotta run, but i will be in touch. keep me posted on all your
decisions.

Lisa

I wanted to send out a reminder e-mail regarding our philanthropy event on
February 20th.  We will be creating care packages for KIPP Academy students
who are in boarding school.  Many of these kids have never been away from
home - so we create small study packs filled with snacks, supplies and notes
to encourage them.  Originally we were planning on holding this event at
KIPP Academy however we were able to get a room at St. Luke's church.
Please meet at St. Luke's at 7:00 p.m. on February 20th in room R25.  If you
have any quote books or inspiration books - please bring those along as well
to help with the notes.  If you have any questions, please don't hesistate
to send me an e-mail.

See you on Wednesday!
Ashley

- St. Luke's is located on the corner of Edloe and Westheimer.  Edloe is
just west of Kirby.

Just wanted to update you on a couple major changes in my life.....

The other big news in my life is that I willl be leaving QUALCOMM on
November 2nd to work for the US State Department.  This means (another!)
cross-country move from San Diego to Washington, D.C.

Please take note of my new mailing address and email below, and PLEASE keep
in touch!  I'll especially need to hear from you going through this
transition- I'm sad to be leaving QUALCOMM and San Diego, but am looking
forward to this next big adventure.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Best Offers I've sniffed out!

Well, the airlines continue to duke it out over fares leaving travelers
wondering how they can continue these deep discounts.  USA Today and Reuters
News Service have both referred to the sale as a ""Street Fight.""  Just last
week, the carriers seemingly did away with three day advance fares, which
impacted business travelers more than leisure, but today those fares are back
with some of the three day round-trip fares as low as $189 plus the obligatory
and ever present taxes and fees.

Two for One fares last seen on Southwest some four years ago have returned and
American Trans Air continues its ""Buy Three, Fly Free"" promotion. JetBlue is
flying coast to coast for under $250 with taxes and fees and the other small
carriers, like National, Vanguard and AirTran all have some sort of promotion
going.

In most cases, tickets must be purchased no later than the first week in April
and are good for travel through July with a couple of carriers allowing returns
by Friday, August 3, 2002.  Many of these exceptional fares are available at
http://www.onetravel.com

The hotel industry is continuing its rebound with some unique offers.  Hyatt
and American Express are offering a $50 ""Spending Money"" reward for a two-night
stay at participating properties.  Rates per night range from $62 at the Hyatt
Regency Tech Center in Denver, to a not so reasonable $370 per night at the
Hyatt Regency Grand Cayman Resort & Villas.  You must be an American Express
cardholder and a member of Hyatt's Gold Passport program to take advantage of
the offer.  Be sure to ask for offer code GIFT2U when making reservations.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Hi Kenyan runners,  here is some useful information  concerning the 20k this week end and what pace you should run.
You should run the first 10K at that  pace then pick up, if possible, the second 10K.
 
Marine Corps, New York, or San  Antonio should use the faster sheet 
All other runners use the slower  sheet.  
Thanks

"New Risk Management Policy","
Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") are exposed to market, credit, operational and liquidity/funding risks in the normal course of its business activities.  The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the ""Policy"") on August 14, 2001.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluated, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transactions via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes, and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of various risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management framework.  

Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Following an initial transiton period, various individuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk management framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an example of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.

If you have any questions, please contact Cassandra Schultz, cassandra.schultz@enron.com, 713-853-0429 who will put you in touch with the appropriate Risk Assessment & Control representative.  Note: this is a confidential policy, not for distribution to anyone outside of the Company without specific authorization from the Chief Risk Officer.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

"RE: more seattle advice","oh im SOOO glad the weather was good.

i am not disappointed that you didnt go kayaking- are you kidding? ive
been here 6 months and havent done it yet!
so glad yall liked the market and ""the bite""...

i think the seattle market is so neat. some of those people travel 2
hours every day to get to seattle to sell their fruits, flowers, etc.
alot of them are asian immigrants just trying to ""make it"" in america-
all the ""stalls"" where they sell fish, etc are great small business
success stories. that's why i like supporting it...

take care

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  It's been really busy here lately.
You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up
kayaking.
Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.
It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and
Vancouver.

The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of
time
outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled
shrimp
there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We
also
hit ""the Bite"" which was really neat.

Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me
know
the next time you're in Houston.  It be great to see you again.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan

   Thanks Bonnie...we're staying at the Mayflower Inn.  I'll give you a
   call
   on your cell phone when we get to town.  It may not be until Friday
   though

      hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
   when
      i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might
have
   info
      on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want
to
   try
      seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good
and
      helpful

      i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for
the
      weekend unfortunately....

      i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday
morning,
      and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
      night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want
to
      do!

      the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
   you
      never know.

      my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket
for
      sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
   believe
      me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
   could
      get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

      Hi Bonnie,

      How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
   have
      been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
   riding
      public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
   have
      some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in
Seattle.
   One
      of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long
weekend
   in
      your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope
you're
      still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It
looks
      like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good
thing
      for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
      offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
   live
      in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit
of
   a
      research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
   for
      restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great,
and
      maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a
drink.

      Thanks a bunch,
      Susan

Attached are 2 documents describing the reorganization of the west trading desk.  I have assigned new books to all of the traders except Phillip. We are currently moving the August physical trades into the new books and plan to be finished tomorrow. You will continue to use your existing financial books through July 31st.  All August physical deals done during bid week should flow into the new physical books and the old financial books.   Your financial trades will move on the night of July 1st after we calc.  Starting August 1st, you will have your positions in your new financial and physical books.  Russ is working on adding the new books to the West Intramonth Position Portfolio in Sitara.  You should be able to see your physical positions for August in the new books as soon as we get all of the deals moved (tomorrow evening at the latest).  The positions will be close in the morning, we just need to verify that we have not missed any deals and move all of the intra-desk deals.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food
items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend
activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is
short, right?

I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that
you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up
to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must
sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?

Susan

Maybe I'll hit an ""Eaters"" outing.

"Jennifer's Shower - RSVP","Hi Everyone,

Some of you might be aware that we are planning a Bridal Shower for Jennifer
Bowles on Nov 3rd. Invitations have not yet been sent out so don't be
alarmed if you haven't received one.

The shower will be between the hours of 7-9 (maybe 9:30 p.m.) What we were
thinking about doing afterwards is going to the Mucky Duck and catching
Jimmy LaFave, who is performing at 10 p.m. He is one of Jennifer's favorites
and we thought it would be a nice surprise.

What I need is to know is who all would be interested in going to the show?
Tickets are $15 and we need to get them ASAP. It will probably last until
midnight.

If everyone could please email me back and let me know if you are interested
in going, that would be great.

Please don't mention this to Jennifer, we want to keep it a surprise.

Thank You,
Sarah

 Or at least 20%% of her is. How do *we* know? She just took
 TheSpark's famous BITCH*TEST.

 So what about *you*? Is it true that you blame everyone but yourself for
 your problems?

 Your bitchiness seems dangerously high, but there's only one way
 to know for sure:

	  Take the BITCH*TEST
	  http://www.thespark.com/bitchtest

 Take the test, discover your inner (or outer) bitch, and then
 check your score against Rebecca Misetr's and all your other friends'.

"RE: NCL Meeting - Monday, March 25th","One more thing, if you are unable to attend the meeting you need to email
either Courtney Votaw (cvotaw@yahoo.com) or Stacey Rozell
(stacey.e.rozzell@us.authuranderson.com) by next Friday, March 22nd.

If you notify Courtney/Stacey it will count as an excused absence (you get 3
a year, I think), but if you don't, it will count as an unexcused absence.

Let me know if you have any questions...

Some friends were sitting at the bar talking about their professions. 
The first guy says ""I'm a Y.U.P.P.I.E, you know.... 
Young, Urban, Professional, Peaceful; Intelligent; Ecologist"" 
The second guy says ""I'm a D.I.N.K, you know.... 
Double Income, No Kids."" 
The third guy says, ""I'm a R.U.B., you know... 
Rich, Urban, Biker."" 
They turn to the woman and ask her, ""What are you?"" 
She replies: ""I'm a WIFE, you know.... 
Wash, Iron, F***, Etc."" 
A second gal answers their question before they even ask it: 
""BITCH ""So, just exactly what is a BITCH??????????"" They ask in unison. 
* B- BABE

"Organizational Announcement","
From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

"India Update","Hello all,

I know, I know... the updates have been few and far between. But
here it goes.

Its about 1:30 pm on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon.  I had a safe
trip to Ooty and back chaperoning the high school girls field
hockey trip. Ooty is another hill station about an 8 hour bus trip
from here. The students travel there about 3 times a semester to
compete in various sporting events. Its significantly bigger so there
are more schools (and more shopping opportunities) there to
compete with. We left Thursday afternoon and arrived Thursday
evening. On Friday, it was the outdoor field hockey competition
between 4 schools. The girls won 2nd place. On Saturday the girls
won first place in indoor hockey. Hebron, a British missionary
school, hosted the tournament. It was the first time I saw so many
people that looked like me. It was unbelievable how many blond
hair, blue-eyed people there were. Hebron was founded around the
same time Kodaikanal International School was (about 100 years
ago) and while KIS has transformed itself from a purely American
Christian school to an International School, Hebron has remained
virtually the same with regards to its Christian beginnings and to
the students enrolled. Its largely British, with Australians and New
Zealanders and very few Indian students. I had a great time getting
to know the girls and answering a lot of their questions about the
States for the 12th grade girls who have applied to colleges in the
US.

The trip was amazing, but also a bit depressing. Its so sad to travel
through. Some of the living conditions are unbelievably poor
especially in the plains. We are also so fortunate to be able to live
the way we do.  Anyways... I am also extremely busy substituting
a 9th grade English honors class. The teacher is out for 2 weeks
for a supposed spider bite and skin graph. I really wish I had paid
more attention in high school. The students are reading
Shakespeare and luckily its Romeo and Juliet. ITs about the only
Shakespeare story that anyone can fumble through. It was to
initially be a supervisory role when we thought he would be out 3
days but its now more a teaching role since hes out for 2 weeks.
Can't wait for him to return.

Gotta run. Want to try to take a nap before ultimate frisbee. Didn't
make it home until 3 am last night from Ooty. I will be sending
another email mid-March after long weekend. I am heading to the
southern state of Kerala with Priya and her family for a boating
backwaters trip through some Indian villages.

Hope all is well! Take care.

Love,
Lisa

Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

FYI.

Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 22, 2001
CA Power Buying Agency Shops for Natural Gas, Too 
As part of its 53 long-term electricity contracts, California's Department of Water Resources (DWR) is shopping for a portfolio of natural gas supplies of various duration to use in about half the deals that give the state the option of providing its own fuel supplies when it can beat prevailing market rates used by its power suppliers. 
So far, it has seven gas deals in various stages of development with six different marketers, according to Sacramento-based DWR spokesperson Oscar Hidalgo. Two contracts are in effect now with Pan-Canadian Energy Services for July and August strips of gas supplies. At this point, DWR will not talk about how much gas and/or electric supplies are involved. 
""We have a total of seven 'enabling agreements' that allow us to purchase supplies into the future without re-doing the whole contract process each time,"" Hidalgo said. ""What we have now are two executed contracts with Pan-Canadian for gas. 
""It doesn't mean we have to supply gas for the generator (in our long-term contracts), it just means if we can buy gas at a better rate, we have an option to do so. So we're in the early stages of building a gas portfolio that will allow us to bring gas to the deal if it is cost-effective for us to do so."" 
DWR is looking at possible storage services as part of its gas deals, said Hidalgo, noting that the state's power-buying agency wants to hedge by having some bulk power deals tied to fixed prices and others using gas tolling arrangements. 
In addition to the Canadian company, the five other gas marketers with which DWR is talking are: BP Energy Co.; Coast Energy Group; Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.; Dynegy Marketing and Trade; and Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Media Reports","
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update #26- US Response to Terrorism
Importance:	High


See below for update on situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress.

RJ

1. 	The War on the Ground

For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the special forces ""inserted"" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use the collected intelligence from various sources to ""snatch"" bin Laden and others, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircraft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikely to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.

Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that currently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the ground and some special operation forces ""in-country.""  Also,  British Special Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Advance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a week ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just west of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored AC-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan. 

The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower, ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups the US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In addition the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron around the HMS Invincible.

Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alliance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban.  

Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pakistan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and the actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a minimum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their intelligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.

2.	Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus measures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the $55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed. 
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preference over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to anesthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate ""bailouts"" that have not yet included anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospects:
?	Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are probably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directly in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big number if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes into Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be careful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is likely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn. 
?	Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the right medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you have already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the budget flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those who pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, but not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear that they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than ""the rich."" Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in. 
?	Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities for anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off your list. 
?	Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is sympathetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but the totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and health care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into shock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promised them support for some serious version of these programs in return for bailing out the airlines without clogging the debate with ""airline worker assistance"" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-house rebellion. 
?	Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be virtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut is something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, but if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worker assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been running into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal corporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay on something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is that companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as assets would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calculated benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirers depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses that companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop. 
?	Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vast assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by the same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and on which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no way to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the accelerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, there may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies. 
?	Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaurant and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handicap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on personal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make the cut others will not, but they can add up fast. 
?	Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional leaders that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the President would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade deals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democrats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. If he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn't cost anything.

We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week since the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time to waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact.

playing bingo and listening to the El Orbits - but we will also have
prizes available that you can purchase opportunity tickets for!!!  (Just

Thanks, But No Thanks: Turning Down the Offer
by Carole Martin
	[IMAGE]	
[IMAGE]	[IMAGE]	
	[IMAGE]	

In today's job market, it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer. Everyone should be so lucky as to even get an offer. But you need to stop and think before you jump out of desperation into a situation that is not good for you. Even though it may be uncomfortable, there are times when you have to say, ""Thanks, but no thanks.""
Great News; You've Got an Offer
George was laid off from his job in June. After four months of rejection, he finally got an offer. He was excited. Or was he?
It really wasn't the job he wanted. It was just one of the jobs he had applied for, because he was qualified and could perform the duties. The job really didn't match any of his values. Taking this job meant a long commute in heavy traffic. Financially, it was going to be a lateral move. But, most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity. The thought of going to this job day after day depressed him before he even accepted.
How could he turn down an offer after so many months of waiting? He was dreading telling his wife about the offer for fear she would think he was crazy for not taking it. How could he tell the company he didn't want the job after going through all those interviews?
Do What You Want
The company wanted to know by the end of the week. George was making himself sick thinking about the decision. That afternoon, he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times. ""Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do,"" was the message. George knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to continue looking for a better opportunity.
When he told his wife, not only was she understanding, but she was encouraging as well. ""Life is too short to make decisions that are going to make you miserable,"" she told George. The decision was made. George would turn down the offer. Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it.
Making the Call
The next morning George placed a call to the hiring manager. ""I've thought over the offer extended and have made a career decision not to accept the position,"" he told the manager. ""I am grateful to you for believing in me, and I hope there may be an opportunity for us to do business in some way in the future."" The hiring manager was disappointed but said he understood career decisions and the need to do what's in one's best interest.
It takes courage and maturity to reject a job you really don't want. The best way to handle difficult decisions is to weigh the consequences and decide what is best for you. Since you don't want to alienate a business contact in the process, it is best to be as professional about the conversation as you can. Preparing a script ahead of time will assist you with your discomfort. No one likes confronting unpleasant situations, but one difficult moment compared to weeks, months or even years of work you find unpleasant is a small price to pay.

"Your Role in Computer Virus Protection","As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Here is a brief overview of the WSCC Coal Plants.  It gives you a basic idea of where plants are, what kind of coal they burn, and how big they are.  If you have any questions feel free to let me know.

"A.Word.A.Day--greenmail","greenmail (GREEN-mayl) noun

   The practice of buying a large quantity of a company's stock as a hostile
   takeover measure, and then selling it to the company at a higher price.

[From green (money) + mail (as in blackmail).]

   ""Second, Northwest sees its economic stake in Continental rise rapidly
   and is then allowed to sell most of its stock back to Continental in a
   transaction that deserves to be called greenmail.""
   Floyd Norris, Little to Cheer About For Public Shareholders,
   The New York Times, Nov 7, 2000.

This week's theme: words with color as metaphors.

Whenever you commend, add your reasons for doing so; it is this which
distinguishes the approbation of a man of sense from the flattery of
sycophants and admiration of fools. -Richard Steele, author and editor

Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the
first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???

i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work
out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very
excited to visit you in seattle when i return. i must say that you did
a very bold thing turning down UBS without having  another job
lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean
break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with UBS going to
 relocate or stay in houston? did lenhart accept? how long did you
have to make your decision? are you still working at enron for the
moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a
paycheck?  what does your mom think about seattle? i cant
believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...
just excited to hear.

yvette and erik have accepted jobs at Huber and are staying in
houston, but signed the contract to sell there house before they
accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.
anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail
 email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent
been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to
find you if you leave enron soon.

talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week
 in kodai.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"a little something to think about","
Sue-
 
In lieu of my attendance in Austin, I want to know if you have any good books for me to read.  I'm gotten a list from Sam and from a friend at school, but I thought that you'd have some solid contributions.
 
A theory (for the Prince of Peacers):
 
I debating the concept that we are a gigantic sociological experiment to God.  I'm thinking that individually God knows nothing about us, or cares for that matter.  I feel that when he gets tired of watching Jerry Springer re-runs, he looks down on our little planet form his lay-z-boy and selects one of us at random, throws a dose of adversity at us and watches how we handle it.  Gotta be more entertaining than watching fat half naked people air their dirty laundry on T.V.  Then again maybe not.
 
I hope all is well.  Glad you like the new job.
 
JON

IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  MONTH & TAG YOU'RE IT! 

[IMAGE]
Well, it is and that  means you and me. I'm supposed to send this to
[IMAGE]
FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures; 
There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and 
only eight who do.  
Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]
If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due 
to  her proportions. 
The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.
[IMAGE]
The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! 
A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent 
looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
[IMAGE]
Today they weigh 23%  less.
[IMAGE]
~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.
[IMAGE]
An English professor  wrote the words, ""Woman without her man is nothing,"" on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. 
The men wrote: ""Woman,  without her man, is nothing."" 
The women wrote: ""Woman! Without her, man is  nothing."" 
The Images of Mother 
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot!
[IMAGE]
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 
14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 
16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 
18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 
25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  
***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in 
celebration of Women's History Month. 
If  you do, something good will happen.... YOU will boost another 
woman's  self-esteem!

"Update on Retention & Severance Plan","
We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

"A.Word.A.Day--corybantic","corybantic (kor-i-BAN-tik) adjective

   Wild; frenzied; uncontrolled.

[After Corybant, an ancient priest of Phrygian goddess Cybele, who
performed wild ecstatic dances in her worship.]

   ""The radio is nothing but a conduit through which pre-fabricated din
   can flow into our homes. And this din goes far deeper, of course, than
   the eardrums. It penetrates the mind, filling it with a babble of
   distractions, blasts of corybantic or sentimental music, continually
   repeated doses of drama that bring no catharsis, but usually create
   a craving for daily or even hourly emotional enemas.""
   Aldous Huxley, On Silence, 1946.

Political Update

International

US Arab allies (Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE) walking a fine line.  Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.

In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. 

Oil Politics

OPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy.

"RE: Nathan Thomas","Hey Susan,

I think my brother and his wife might be at Laura
Jahnke's wedding as well - you might say hello.

School starts in 1 1/2 weeks.  I am really excited
about starting.  I should learn at ton, and get
exposed to all sorts of things which will be helpful
in the coming years.  My parents are driving up today
to help me move into my new place, closer to school(my
parents are awesome!).

Rx-Saver.com is nearing completion.  Hopefully, we
will open for business in a few weeks.  Starting a
business has been more of a challenge than i expected.
 Just when things get rolling, a challenge raises its
ugly little head.  But, I love it.  It is alot more
fun than a 9-5 job, and there is alot more potential
to hit a homerun.

Anyways, I hope life is going great!  Say hello to
Allan and Lisa for me.


Have fun,
Paul

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to
do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday. I will ask though.
You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and
leaving Korea on Sunday). The total air fare should be $962. Shoot me
a quick e mail if this is not ok. Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing
your tickets this afternoon. Thanks!

"INDIA UPDATE","
hello all,
havent been as good about sending mass email updates as i had  originally intended, so here we go...
well, you have all been asking if i have been sick and i can finally  answer yes. it happened this weekend, and of all places and times  while i was chaperoning a 9th grade camping trip. i am considering  myself extremely lucky though for a couple of reasons: 1) my  stomach actually held out for 3 weeks in india, 2) it only lasted  about 36 hours and started at the latter half of the camping trip,  and 3) supposedly it should only hit once (we will see; we all know  how much i enjoy being the exception to every rule). 
the camp was at a beautiful spot called Poondi. the school owns  several hundred acres of land surrounding a lake about a 2 hr drive  and then a 30 minute hike from campus. KIS is in the process of  building bathrooms and showers, a sand volleyball court, and a  deck going out onto the water. so it was actually great to be there  ""roughing it"" with the 13 students before all the distractions are in  place. we spent the days repelling and doing archery and i was  actually leading some of these activities. SCARY?? so aside from  the 3 rats in the girls hole in the ground bathroom and the  extremely bumpy bus ride it was rather enjoyable. the kids got a  kick out of the herd of bison (and so did i) on the road on our way  back to school. they were absolutely enormous and the bus driver  had to turn off the engine while we sat patiently and waited 20  minutes for them to finish doing whatever it was they were doing so  we could proceed on.
priya and i were scheduled to chaperone a school dance that  evening but given my stomach problems i opted out and it ended  up being canceled anyway for a memorial service. a 5th grade  student who became ill the first day of class, Jan. 8, died this  weekend. he was transported to madurai for care on jan. 9 and had  been in extremely bad condition ever since. indian dr.s have no  idea the cause and had called on other dr. around the world to help  identify the cause but still nothing has been determined. the first  thought was that he contracted something at school but that was  quickly ruled out given the short time frame he was actually here.  the students werent allowed to arrive before jan. 7 and given his  unique case and that no other students have had any of symptoms  it was ruled an impossibility. even more tragic, the parents of  another student had gone to visit Asad in the hospital shortly after  he was admitted and on their way home were involved in a car  accident. the father died immediately and the mother has been in a  coma. she is expected to make a full recovery, but nonetheless,  extremely traumatic events for young children at the start of the  semester. 
lets move on to a brighter topic.... i am still enjoying myself. i  started study hall last night. i will be doing study hall every tuesday  night from 7-9 in the girls 7th and 8th grade dorm for math and  english. its unbelievable how stupid you can feel trying to do 8th  grade math. i was reading the textbook to remind myself what the  rules were for arithmetic and geometric sequences. intramurals  began this week. mondays and thursdays i am doing 7th and 8th  grade boys vball intramurals. so my evenings are pretty busy and  my days are getting busier. i just took on the kindergarten PE  class. i start next week. there are 6 of them and when i asked what  they are doing currently the elementary school coordinator told me  that yesterday they were marching left, right, left to learn the  difference between their right and left. he suggested that next i  teach them to skip, hop, gallop, etc. how cute is that? i am really  looking forward to it especially after spending everyday 9th and  10th period with the juniors and seniors. some more good news...I  found out monday that all volunteers were given a pay increase  effective immediately for the month of january. i was making 700  Rs/mo. (approx. $14) and am now making 2,000 Rs/mo. (approx.  $40). priya assures me that she doesn't spend more than 4,000  Rs/mo. so obvioulsy expensives are of little concern. so this is an  invitation to all of my fellow ex-enron employees still job-hunting  with no attachments or responsibilities (Bryan, Niclas) to come for  an extended visit?  dont worry its not a one time invitation. you will  be asked again. 
this weekend i am helping to finalize plans and registration for the  Terry Fox 10K Cancer fundraiser on sunday. Terry Fox was a  canadian man who lost a leg to cancer and started this fundraiser  before he died in the early nineties. The fundraiser now takes place  in 54 countries and India is the 8th largest contributing country. A  canadian woman that i work very closely with here brought the  fundraiser to Kodai last year and it was a huge success.  before all  of that i am chaperoning the middle school's weekend activity  saturday night, Night Frisbee. 
It should be a pretty tame weekend (not that weekends here arent)  given the recent events in Calcutta. the state of Tamil Nadu and the  rest of India have put American Institutions on high alert. So this  morning at an all-school assembly the principal met with staff and  students to inform us of the security measures that are in place for  the remainder of the week and through the weekend and possibly  ongoing. All school campus have been shut down and locked up  with only the main entrances accessible and guarded by indian  commandoes. the students all laughed at the word ""commandoes""  instead of ""police"" or ""armed guards"" but that was the word used.  students and staff effective by end of school today are required to  wear ID badges, no visitors other than family members of student  and staff are allowed on campus, and students who live in dorms  off campus will be transported to and from dorm by bus. I LIVE ON  CAMPUS!! I still feel very safe here given the inaccessibility of  Kodaikanal. we are extremely far south of everything that continues  to happen in the north, 7,000 ft up in the mountains, a 3 hr. ride up  the mountain, and remember indians aren't the people committing  these acts. i havent said any of this to worry anyone. actually my  intent was quite the opposite. i am anticipating emails from a lot of  you questioning the schools response to the incident in calcutta  and wanted to assure all of you that security measures are in  place. 
love you and miss you,
Lisa
I know i forgot many people. my distribution lists are set up on  my hotmail account. Ashley, please forward on to Jahnke.  Leigh Ann, to Tracy and the rest of the girls.

"hi","Hey Susan,

I don't know if you remember me or not, I went to UT and was a good
friend of Stephanie Spence.  I know I met you at one of her showers or
maybe as late has her wedding.  Anyway, several people have told me that
you work here so I thought that I would say hello.

How long have you worked here?  What do you do?  Do you like it?  I'm on
the 25th floor with Net Works.  I started in January and so far I like
it.  I'm still trying to get used to my job and Houston in general.

Well, I just wanted to let you know I'm here.  Talk to you later.

I can check on getting an earlier flight, but I have a feeling that's it.  I have a new computer at work and don't have messenger downloaded yet, but if you think you might be at work for a while, I might try and do it.

if I could get into Houston closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be
a better for me. I'd really like to stay that Saturday night...so if worse

Susan,
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.
That part is fine. However, if you leave on the following Sunday,
you'll be back into Houston Sunday. Here is the tenative itenerary:
Looks like Continental! leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental
to LAX 0940-1105.
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230. You would arrive on Wed evening
(the 15th) at 5:05pm.
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the
26th and arriving to LA at
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and
arriving in Houston at 9:00pm
Sunday night.
Let me know how that sounds.

Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for
me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I! 'd like

go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the

"Tragedy Claims Life of Enron Employee","As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.

"A.Word.A.Day--crabwise","crabwise (KRAB-wyz) adjective

   1. Sideways.

   2. In a cautious or roundabout manner.

[From the sideways movement of crabs.]

   ""John Smith is still moving crabwise towards modernity.""
   John Major's Last Year?, The Economist (London), May 15, 1993.

It's a blessing to have a child at home. As parent of a four-year old,
I strive to answer my daughter Ananya's incessant questions about moon
and earthworms and clouds and trees and bears as truthfully as I can. Our
investigations into these seemingly mundane matters often reveal insights
that are learning experiences for both of us. But there are times when
my thoughts are elsewhere and I simply answer the question ""Why?"" with
""Because that's how God made 'em."" I didn't know the joke was on me until
the evening I found the corner of our living room wall scribbled with
bright shades of crayons. When questioned why we had that mural on the
wall, she simply replied, ""Because that's how God made it.""

Well, if we were to ask why a crab moves crabwise or sideways, that'd be
a pretty good answer: because that's how God (or nature, depending on how
your beliefs run) made it. Because that's how their legs bend. That's how
their muscles flex. That's how they've adapted. That's how they survive
as a species. And that's how we got a synonym for the word `sideways' in
our dictionary. If we were to look up the term `humanwise' in a crab's
dictionary, chances are it would mean `sideways'.

This week's AWAD features more words derived from animals (the only
animal-based products we use around here).                     -Anu

"RE:","
from what i hear, her high rise appt is pretty much the reason for the
season, so to speak.....although she did sound a bit inspired about the
possibility of doing some buying work in the silver dept, which would
involve trips to the orient.  all this is second hand of course- was severly
hung over when niki talked to her on sun after the party.  i was a shameful
girl sat night- although i inflicted damage on no one but myself.  had mini
pms-induced temper tantrum/self-pity party at the bar w/ niki, her friend,
nima and wenus, then wandered off to catch the night bus at trafalger
square....needless to say, was so drunk i passed out on the bus, and slept
waaaaaaay past my stop, ending up somewhere in acton- the equiv of living in
lakewood, then waking up in hempstead.  had 3 pounds to my name, no money on
houston acct to pulse $ out, and at 4 am, not too many cabs haunting the
gangster area of acton.....was a pitiful scene.  had to bribe a mini cab to
drop me off as close to ladbrok grove as 3 pounds would take me, then
hobbled home about 3 miles in heels, whiney and drunk.  very sad.  no
matter.  am almost done w/ dreaded paper!
well, maybe it is time for susan to explore new territories.  am pretty damn
sure there are other alternatives to enron in the seattle area that offer
job description close to what you're doing or want to do.  enron is not the
only game in town- and shouldn't hold you back from having new experineces
or making inspired decisions.  could warrant some research.  keep me posted.
back to smae old, same old.....chat soon- will try to call after finish said
paper later tonight.

>Why are Aggies the shame of Texas ?
>Well, I am probably not the best person to go into this. I can assure you
>my
>brother, and other Horns who have had the torture of spending time in
>College Station can tell it better than I, but here are my takes on the
>subject.
>1) They won't shut up. They have to go on about spirit, and dogs, and old
>army, and red ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they
>have in their urine to beat U.T., and blah bah blah. Shut up. You start to
>get the feeling their entire school was built to spite U.T. Forget the fact
>that when the Texas Legislature back in the 1870's passed legislation to
>start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of
>the main school (University of Texas) that would teach agriculture and
>mechanics. Ags love to say their school is older, from where they get that
>I
>don't know.........the fact is, the State intended a&m to be a branch of
>U.T. They are like afterbirth from the original creation. Like Danny Devito
>in 'Twins'. So they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they
>must
>devote their entire school to trying to prove to U.T. that they are just as
>good. All the while, nobody at U.T. denies that A&M is a good school, yet
>they won't shut up. So they write a fight song ... about ... Texas, and how
>they want to beat us. They have a Fish camp for Freshman ... where ... they
>tell them how bad Texas is and how good A&M and all its traditions are. It
>is the worlds longest known case of penis envy, and it is manifest in
>everything A&M does.
>2) The people at A&M. Now we all have friends who went to A&M or are at
>A&M.
>There are some nice people there. However......there is the Corp. East
>Texas
>answer to dreams of ROTC kids everywhere. For every boyscout who never
>learned to stop playing with his GI Joe toys, there is the Corp. Now,
>forget
>the fact that A&M will actually let people with sub-par grades enroll if
>they agree to join the Corp. Forget the fact that the Corp looked like a
>gestapo hate rally when beating down students (including one instance of
>tackling and punching a young girl) on Kyle Field in 1995. Forget the fact
>that along with the numerous hazing charges that have been filed against
>them, and swept under the rug over the years, they just this past month
>have
>had one Corp member bring charges against another Corp member who
>apparently
>had been propositioning others for a little mutual Sodomy. Not only could I
>go on with more instances of idiocy by these Khaki clad shaven headed
>dorks,
>I am sure each of you have your own stories. The point is: We all respect
>West Point, Anapolis, The Air Force Academy. Nobody respects the Corp. I
>imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world. Just
>because you dress like the Army, and try and act like the Army, does not
>make you the Army. People at A&M don't even like these clowns. It is not
>cool to shave your head and dress up. Halloween is only supposed to be one
>day of the year. If you want to carry guns and beat up civilians, move to
>Israel. It is even less cool to slobber on somebody's daughter on national
>television and call it a tradition. Dry humping 18 year old girls in the
>stands at football games is not cool. Not only is it not cool, it should be
>against the law. I know that in College Station, students are prone to just
>mount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or any time
>anything good happens you can just grab the girl next to you and start
>sucking on her face. But everywhere else in the world, it is looked down
>upon. Especially if you are doing it on my T.V. That is why we had to move
>the game from Thanksgiving. Because people across the nation were gagging
>on
>their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game, some boys
>scout
>is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody's thanksgiving
>dinner. We do not need to see burly women engaged in a suck fest every time
>your woeful offense manages to put points on the board. Some of these girls
>are in desperate need of a trip to the Clinique counter. Screw that, forget
>make-up, it is too late for that, just give them a veil.
>3) I have only dated one aggie in my lifetime. She was a cute girl too. But
>our relationship, albeit doomed from the start, was cut short when she
>ripped butt in my presence on a date. I am willing to look past many
>shortcomings in a woman, but do not expect to drop ass, in my bedroom no
>less, and expect not to get run. There will be no blasting of foul air by
>my
>future wife. At least not until we are engaged. Come on. Is that common in
>College Station ? Do ags sit around on dates just trading glandular
>salutes.
>""Hey Betty (FARRRT) Can you top that ????"" ""Sure Bill, (GGGRRUUUNNTTTT) put
>that in your pipe and smoke it"". Truly Gross. Is that what ags mean by 'Red
>Ass' and 'Old Army' ? She sure laid some Old Army that night.
>4) T.U. is not funny. It is not insulting. It is just dumb. Just imagine
>Ags, if folks from Texas kept talking about M&A, and giggling. That would
>not be funny. In fact it would be retarded. That's why we don't do it.
>Please learn.
>5) You want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond of
>sheep, of people that aren't stupid? Then quit building things that fall
>down. Quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national television.
>Quit whooping in church. Quit whooping period. Quit putting up scoreboards
>for the enjoyment of dead mammals. Quit spending your Friday nights
>practicing how to yell. Quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you're
>running for Governor. When you are filling out your season ticket renewals,
>and the form asks for your - Phone #, H & W: - Quit putting 258-3999,
>Height
>6'3, weight 185. Just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. Go to
>East Texas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th grade
>education why they cheer for A&M and wear maroon. That is your fan base.
>This is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid.
>6) Nobody cares if you think your band is better. They might be louder,
>they
>might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. But
>the point is, nobody cares 'who wins halftime'. Quit getting geeked up
>about
>marching bands. I find it hard to believe you stood through your high
>school
>band's entire halftime performance. And why? Cause nobody cared then, and
>nobody cares now. Plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do
>care. Why is it cool all of a sudden now that you're in college ?
>7) Men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. Perhaps the only
>justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an
>anal probe. Oh wait........I understand now.
>8) Dogs are not ladies. They don't look or smell like ladies. Dogs eat
>their
>own feces and should be treated accordingly.
>9) Finally. College Station is an arm-pit of a town. Quit pretending that
>it
>is a great college town. It is a town, and there is a college there. That
>should be the end of this comparison. If you feel that life doesn't get any
>better than the Dixie Chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending
>'Dukes Of Hazard' episode, then move there. More importantly, don't move to
>Austin........we are trying to create an educated, technological, and open
>minded population base. Austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplace
>and final resting place of all that is cool. As my friend Stephen Johnston
>once said: ""If the world were ever to get an enema, College Station is
>where
>you would connect the hose."" If you go to school at A&M, please don't be an
>aggie.
>God Bless the Great State of Texas

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

"Assistance for Enron Alumni","
Dear Enron Alum: 

The Ford Career Center at the McCombs School of Business is very concerned about the welfare of our alumni who have been working with Enron.  We wanted to make all of our Enron alumni aware of the services we are able to offer to assist them if they need or choose to do a job search at this time.  Most of these services are available remotely through our web site at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/ .

*  Free access to UT job postings at https://accessut.utexas.edu/students .  This system requires a UTEID to log in.  If you do not have one or cannot remember yours, there is a link on the login screen to request one.  There are generally more than 1,000 jobs on this system at any time for a variety of skills sets and experience levels.  We encourage you to take advantage of this.

* Free access to the Vault Career Library.  (Link listed in ""also see"" box on our web page at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/mba/ .)  With your UTEID you have access to thousands of company profiles and industry guides.

* Free access to the materials in our on-site Career Library.  We have hundreds of books, periodicals and on-line subscriptions to assist you with your job search.  The Career Library is open 8-5, Monday-Friday.

* Access to our recruiting database and participation in our alumni resume book for only $75.  (Details and registration at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/alum/ .)  Because we are still student fee supported, we are required to charge non-students for access to our student-funded recruiting databases.  We've worked to keep the fees as low as possible in order to better assist you.  We also actively market our on-line alumni resume book available through our recruiting database system and have given access to nearly 100 companies in the past few months.  Participation is included in the $75 recruiter database access fee.

We are also in negotiations with Lee Hecht Harrison to provide more career service options to our alumni and hope to be able to announce these services soon.  Until then, we encourage you to take advantage of what we are able to offer our alumni as they recareer in this challenging economic environment.  For information and additional services, please see our web page at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu .

"Valero at Enron Job Fair on Friday","Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Just wanted to share this.  You may have seen it on the news last night.  My
friend Amy's daughter Hannah was killed Saturday night and the driver that
caused the accident didn't bother to stop.  Not that any of you drive a gold

Austin and there beloved Hannah to your prayers.

Subject:      DSI Chart

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

FINAL
E.10
(Copyright 2001)

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

"hi guys!!","Just wanted to drop a quick note to tell everyone hello and to let you know
my new contact information.  Clay and I are living in my parent's backhouse
(room w/ bathroom and kitchenette over the garage) while we work in Dallas
for the summer.  Our number there is 214-691-3638 and Clay's cell is
214-649-6914.  My work email is jessica.pulliam@bakerbotts.com and my work
number is 214-953-6532.

Hope you all are doing well--I have had a great first few days of work.  But
things have been busy as usual--throwing a 50th Birthday party for my mom on
Thursday--""Come as Jeanie"" (the theme is a suprise)--should be pretty
funny!!  On a heavier note, my gradmother Mimi (mom's mom) had a stoke on
Monday which left her totally paralyzed on one side and unable to eat.  She
decided not to go into the hospital (she hadn't been doing too well) so we
should lose her in the next couple of weeks--I would appreciate very much
your prayers for my family on that front.  I am comforted in that Mimi is
still coherent enough to understand what is going on and in that my mom
seems to be at peace with the whole thing.

Anyway, Clay and I are great--we are looking forward to a wild summer and I
hope this note has found you guys doing well.

Much love to you all,
bate

   Times pointed out the other day that this is the year in which women
   entering law school may, for the first time, outnumber men. The Times
   drafted a number of learned observers to speculate on the meaning of it
   all: Perhaps the atmosphere of law schools will become more `teamlike';
   ... But the most interesting comment in the article came from one Deborah
   Rhode, a Stanford law school professor who worries that the law may become
   a `pink collar ghetto,' like other professions that have traditionally
   welcomed women.""

"FW: Wishing you well","
As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

"A.Word.A.Day--blue rinse","blue rinse (BLOO rins) adjective

   Related to elderly women.

[From the hair-dye used on grey hair that produces a blue shade.]

   ""If the race comes down to a former officer married to an aristocrat and
   blessed with four children - or a quiffed Spaniard with a gay past and a
   soft line on drugs, who do you think the blue rinse brigade will choose?""
   Jonathan Freedland, Still Lost in the Wilderness, The Guardian (London),
   Jul 11, 2001.

Ever wonder how our vocabulary is colored by many hues of a rainbow?
Often we use colors as symbols for ideas, thoughts, and concepts but
do it with little logic. Take the color blue, for example. A blue chip
stock is good to hold in one's portfolio while we're chary of blue-sky
stock. A blue collar worker is a manual laborer yet a bluestocking is one
with intellectual inclinations. A bluenose is a prude but a blue blood is
aristocratic. Even a computer would go crazy trying to make sense of this.
No wonder we made artificial languages to program computers. In this week's
AWAD we take a look at other words and phrases tinged with colors.    -Anu

............................................................................
Choose the life that is most useful, and habit will make it the most
agreeable. -Francis Bacon, essayist, philosopher, and statesman (1561-1626)

RE:	[F8] Misc; comradship


Forwarded by several members:

FYI...  This is an e-mail from an Ensign stationed aboard the USS Winston
Churchill...

Dear Dad,

Well, we are still out at sea, with little direction as to what our next
priority is.  The remainder of our port visits, which were to be centered on
max liberty and goodwill to the United Kingdom, has all but been cancelled.
We have spent every day since the attacks going back and forth within
imaginary boxes drawn in the ocean, standing high-security watches, and
trying to make the best of our time. It hasn't been that fun I must confess,
and to be even more honest, a lot of people are frustrated at the fact that
they either can't be home, or we don't have more direction right now. We
have seen the articles and the photographs, and they are sickening. Being
isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is
happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the effects.

About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the bridge to conduct
Ship handling drills. We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call
from the LUTJENS(D185), a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the
pier in Plymouth, England. While in port, the WINSTON S CHURCHILL and the
LUTJENS got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made
some pretty good friends.

Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close
up on our port side, to say goodbye.  We prepared to render them honors on
the bridge wing, and the Captain told the crew to come topside to wish them
farewell.  As they were making their approach, our Conning Officer announced
through her binoculars that they were flying an American flag.  As they came
even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast. The bridge wing was
crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles- Attention to
Port- the ship came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the
German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues.  They had made up
a sign that was displayed on the side that read ""We Stand By You"".

Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed
alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes.  It was probably the
most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life and more than a few of us
fought to retain our composure.  It was a beautiful day outside today. We
are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecured e-mail our location, but
we could not have asked for a finer day at sea.  The German Navy did an
incredible thing for this crew, and it has truly been the highest point in
the days since the attacks.  It's amazing to think that only a half-century
ago things were quite different, and to see the unity that is being
demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us all feel proud to be
out here doing our job.  After the ship pulled away and we prepared to begin
our man overboard drills the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said, ""I'm
staying Navy.""

I'll write you when I know more about when I'll be home, but for now, this
is probably the best news that I could send you.

Rockies seen as key to U.S. natural gas growth
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - As U.S. natural gas production declines in traditional strongholds such as Texas and the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains are widely viewed as the best bet for boosting domestic supplies to meet rising demand for gas.
	


The Rockies have loomed large in several recent U.S. energy industry acquisitions as companies bet that they will be able to overcome technical obstacles and environmental opposition to unlock the region's rich reserve potential.
``Most of the supply growth in the United States has been disappointing, but we've seen extremely strong growth in the Rockies,'' said Jennifer Snyder, Director of North American Natural Gas at Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA).
The Rockies could contain over 300 trillion cubic feet of recoverable reserves, or almost one quarter of all onshore and offshore reserves in the lower 48 states, according to a report by the National Petroleum Council.
However, not everybody wants to tap that hydrocarbon wealth. The Montana Wilderness Organization, for example, is campaigning to keep the Rocky Mountain Front -- recognized as an important wildlife habitat -- closed to oil and gas drilling.
``This is one of America's national treasures and one of our greatest conservation stories. To try to undo that for a small amount of natural gas doesn't make a lot of sense,'' said Mark Good, a field organizer with the association.
POWER GENERATION DRIVES GROWTH
U.S. gas consumption rose five percent to 22.8 trillion cubic feet in 2000 and despite current concerns about the weak economy, further growth is forecast in the long term, driven largely by increased use of the clean-burning fuel to generate electricity.
Until quite recently there was scant interest in Rockies gas because it was tough to get at, prices were low and there were not enough pipelines to take the gas to market, according to Fred Meissner, a petroleum geologist at the Colorado School of Mines.
But that has changed as the environmental benefits of gas and the development of efficient new combined-cycle gas turbines have spurred increased use of the fuel for power generation.
The lack of pipeline capacity in the Rockies has also eased as big companies such as Williams Cos. (NYSE:WMB - news) and El Paso Corp. (NYSE:EPG - news) have committed themselves to expansion projects.
Phillips Petroleum Co.(NYSE:P - news) gained a foothold in the Rockies by buying gas assets in Wyoming's Powder River Basin last year.
``If you look at total U.S. production to reserves, it's a decline story, but it's exactly the opposite in the Rockies,'' said Don Wallette, Phillips' regional director in the Rockies.
Rocky Mountain gas was also a key driver behind Kerr-McGee Corp's (NYSE:KMG - news) recent acquisition of HS Resources.
Oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell quote from Yahoo! UK & Ireland: SHEL.L) launched a hostile takeover bid for Rockies gas producer Barrett Resources this year, but was thwarted when its offer topped by Williams Cos.
TAPPING ``UNCONVENTIONAL'' GAS
Interest in the Rockies has been spurred in part by technologies that allow ``unconventional'' gas resources, such as coalbed methane, to be exploited economically.
Coal can hold several times as much gas as the rock in conventional reservoirs and it can be extracted by drilling relatively shallow wells into the coal seam, then releasing the gas by pumping out large volumes of water.
First seen on a meaningful scale in the San Juan basin of New Mexico and Colorado in the 1980s, coal bed methane development has spread in recent years to the Raton basin in Colorado and the Green River and Powder River basins in Wyoming.
``The beauty of coalbed methane is that you don't have to discover it, so you eliminate a lot of the traditional risk. It isn't very expensive, compared to setting up an exploration effort offshore,'' said Wallette of Phillips Petroleum.
Coalbed methane draws considerably less enthusiasm from environmentalists who are concerned by the Bush administration's plans to open more federal land in the Rockies to drilling.
Pollution problems associated with the disposal of saline water, released as a byproduct of coalbed methane production have led to protests in some Rockies communities.
Another unconventional resource that can be tapped in the Rockies is ``tight gas'', found deep below the earth's surface in low permeability sandstone that restricts the flow of the gas.
``A few years ago people became aware that there is a lot of gas in these very tight Cretaceous sands but the economics were minimal because you couldn't get it out economically. Hydraulic fracturing turned that around,'' said Professor Meissner.
Fracturing involves injecting a fluid into a rock formation, causing it to crack and making it easier for the gas to flow.
Phillips is mainly focusing on coalbed methane in the Rockies but has drilled some tight gas wells in Utah, said Wallette.

"RE:","damn!  just got kicked off aol for the umpteenth time today....tried to
figure out this messenger business, but only have aol messenger, i think.
and after all the dissertation-induced computer trauma this last moth,
installing it could prove to be the proverbial straw, you know.....good to
hear about chuck sr.  was worried about him when i heard about the missing
planes.  am sure both chucks will be ok.  gals enron was spared as well, but
what an ordeal.  geez.  makes becoming a carpenter and living in NB look
reaaaaaly attractive right about now.  city, schmitty.  a beer out on the
deck rt now would be super cathrtic, i think.  i know y'all aren't getting
all the graphic footage there that we are here of the middle eastern
countries' parades and parties in the streets rt now.  so unreal and
sickening.  how can people be that evil?  really sad- you know michael?
loud, london michael?  turns out he just flew back here from a meeting mon
morning at the WTC, and his entire US office of cantor fitzgerald was based
on the top 5-10 stories of the WTC.  no one has been heard from.
terrifying.  it's just so isolated and lonely here rt now.  want to be home
so badly, and i get so funky in these kinds of situations:  you know, ultra
sentimental and nostalgic and weepy.  and matt didn't help- he did one of
those ""i'm so worried that our friends/family don't know how loved and
appreciated they are"" bits, and that's one of those deep-rooted fears that
you just never want to deal with because we count on lisa to be the
""hallmark"" aspect of our grp, and no one else.  i chalk it up to a
frightening lack of estrogen amongst us all....either way, not something i
want to start thinking about, b/c it's just opening pandora's box, and can't
stop.  still hoping to make it home on fri or sat, and matt said he's going
to houston on fri for a business thing, so maybe we will all get to chill
this weekend if the stars are alligned.  have fingers crossed.  ok- bk to
the bbc and cking on flight possiblities....chat soon-

"A.Word.A.Day--ha-ha","ha-ha (ha-ha) noun

   Sunk fence.

[From French haha, reduplicative of ha!, exclamation of surprise, that might
come out when tripped by such an obstacle.]

   ""They covet our haha fences, tucked out of view by ditches and so named
   because of their surprise value.""
   Tina Kelley, Zoo Nice To See You: Woodland Park Basks In Spotlight,
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Sep 19, 1995.

Instead of explaining in a thousand words what a ha-ha looks like,
I'll show you a picture: http://www.yale.edu/yup/images/bormann3.jpg
Etymologists claim we got the word ha-ha from ha!, the sound one might
exclaim on getting tripped by that trap, otherwise known as a sunken
fence.  I'm sure they have done their research and are right. But I
can't help thinking it might have been derived from the laughter of
a French aristocrat when an unsuspecting guest tripped while visiting
his chateau.

Ah-ha, that gives me an idea, just in time for this April Fool's Day!
I think I'll call a landscape designer.

""Hi, Mr. Dougwell? I'd like to order a ha-ha around my apartment.""
""You'd like to order what?""
""Ha-ha! You think you can do it by next week? I've some visitors coming
 over. And don't forget to bring your Hard Hat and Hack Hammer.""

All kidding aside, what's the brouhaha about this thing? In the 18th
century someone came up with the clever idea of a fence that let the
property owner have an unhindered view of the landscape, giving an
illusion of contiguous land, while protecting him from trespass. Here's
a fascinating essay on the deeper meanings of ha-ha:
http://bsc.edu/~jtatter/borders.html

Well, this week's words may give you an impression that I'm playing an
April Fool's prank on you, but that's not true. All words featured this
week, as in any week, are ""real"" dictionary words.              -Anu

The Weather report

  This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2
  days and a very embarrassed female news anchor who
  will, in the future, likely think before she speaks.

  What happens when you predict snow but don't get any....

  True story... a female news anchor who, the day after it
  was supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the
  weatherman and asked  ""So Bob, where's that 8 inches
  you promised me last night?""

  Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the
  crew did too they were laughing so hard!

"whats up","em,
very good idea on updating everyone on india. i will definitely try to
stay on top of that. i keep finding myself so busy. the school
operates on a 6 day class cycle rather than a 5 day cycle so no
day of the week is ever the same with regards to the kids or the
classes you teach. and to make it even more confusing after
school activities run on a typical 5 day cycle. so intramurals, study
halls, after school meetings, etc are on the same day every week.
so i find myself studying my schedule every night before i go to bed
so i know exactly where i am supposed to be the next morning.  so
my responsibilities thus far are:
* assisting during the day with 8,9,11,12 grade boys vball
* 7,8 grade vball intramurals after school
*study hall at the girls dorms 2 times a week
*and now trying to put together a schedule in which to teach the
staff PC applications. its amazing how little the teachers know with
regards to Microsoft Office especially since the school is trying to
get international recognition. so Priya and I will be putting classes
together so that the teachers get more proficient and then can use
computer applications within there curriculum next semester.

my weekends are pretty busy also. saturday, i am doing an 8 hour
hike to Gunder Falls which is supposed to be absolutely
breathtaking. I did a 5 hour one last weekend and hopefully will get
a chance to get some of those pictures up for everyone to look at.
then sunday, ultimate frisbee. next weekend, i am chaperoning a
camping trip with the 9th grade students and chaperoning a school
dance. the days are long and busy but the nights are fairly
uneventful. we typically do dinner at someones place and then in
bed by 10 and up by 6:30. its fine, because the sun rises at 6 and
by early afternoon the clouds set in and its overcast the rest of the
afternoon and evening. i am hoping that soon changes as well as
the temperature. its absolutely frigid up here. probably no colder
than it gets in houston in january, but theres no escape from it.
there are no heaters and the houses are made of mud with metal
roofing. my first purchase here was a tiny space heater. well, hope
all is well.

i will write more later,
lisa

everyones creative inner pizza genius.

Sauce: Tomato, barbecue, jerk.

"EnronOnline -Stack Manager Changes","We have made the  following modifications to the EnronOnline applications.

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
?	To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.
?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

"Re:","
Hello All-
 
I thought I'd drop everyone a line to say hello.  I'm glad to hear that everyone is on celebrity watch.  I've seen none, let alone anyone with bang me against the headboard beauty.  I am a minor league baseball player though, does that count for anything?
 
I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to make it back for the fourth of July festivities, but I'm always there in spirit.  If anyone has a burning desire to see Lexington Kentucky, I'm your guy. It is the tabacco capital of the world.
 
I just wanted to tell everyone hello, and that I miss everyone.  As insane as that may be.
 
I hope everyone is well.  take care of each other, we are all we have sometimes.
 
Take care.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the  first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???
i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work  out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very  excited to visit you in seattle when i return. i must say that you did  a very bold thing turning down UBS without having  another job  lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean  break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with UBS going to  relocate or stay in houston? did lenhart accept? how long did you  have to make your decision? are you still working at enron for the  moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a  paycheck?  what does your mom think about seattle? i cant  believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...  just excited to hear.
yvette and erik have accepted jobs at Huber and are staying in  houston, but signed the contract to sell there house before they  accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.  anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail  email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent  been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to  find you if you leave enron soon.
talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week  in kodai.

"","hello all at home.   have been packing for almost a week now, and am taking
a break so that i can feel sorry for myself about having to leave london so
quickly.  wah, wah.  is prob. for the best- do not think americans are
winning the prize for 'most popular' in europe right now.  that said, i'm
leaving tuesday morning on Continental flight #5, arriving at IAH at
4:15pm....i know it's morbid, but if any of y'all were flying in the next
week, i'd want to know your flight numbers in case something happened.  am
sure all will be fine, and soon you can all come take advantage of my
employee discount at the wal-mart on 1960 (remember:  christmas is just
around the corner- shop early!) if anyone gets a chance to pick up this
month's vanity fair, please do (no, not the harry potter one...)  I know
i've tried this before and was met w/ much resistance and whining, but i'm
trying again anyways. i know it may be overkill, but the section on new york
was brilliant, and the essays (both the intro by david halberstam, and esp.
toni morrrison's eulogy) were breathtaking.  even those of you who could
care less about the latest cruise 'n cruz gossip should give this issue a
chance...ok, am off.  take care, all, and will chat soon-

Well, since we were victims of the oh so wonderful flood, my carpet is gone and every morning I step on to the actual dirty and cold slab that our house sits on.

Favorite day of the week: Saturday for sure, Sundays are tough b/c that whole church thing lasts like 3 hours                                                                                  &! nbsp;                      >> 29. Favorite song at the moment: ""from this moment...""  Just kidding em and lis-thought I would make you sick for a second.  Honestly- I like anything that I hear that I don't think needs to be played at the wedding.  but if emily makes it (which i doubt, but i understand that whole finishing your dissertation stuff) I have a feeling there might be several strange requests.  maybe ""baby got back"" and katy can do the side bends and sit-ups                                                         &nbs! p;                                                                          >> 30.

Least favorite thing: realizing that i am negative in my checking a! ccount and still have 6 days until pay day
33. Favorite Sport to watch: i like college football or turning on golf on a sunday afternoon and keeping the tv volume really low-its great for a nap                                                       >> 34. Fast Food place: i really don't like fast food that much, but i'll stop for ice cream anytime anywhere...maybe thats why i am having trouble with the whole fitting into my wedding dress thing                                                   &! nbsp;                                                        >> 35. When was the last time you were in the hospital? just about a month ago.. i have had bone scans, blood tests, and 2 MRIs trying to figure out what is wrong with my back.  the Dr.'s answer..."" you are pretty much out of luck, we don't want to operate b/c it is too risky.  keep taking your pain pills, but they are an addictive narcotic so be careful.""                                        &nbs! p;                                                                                  >36. Fave drink: now days -plain coke
>> 37. Favorite Beer: I gave up drinking-part of the whole Mormon thing                           >> 38. How many times did you fail your Drivers test? none - i don't think.  i took it with emily and i remember her making fun of me, but it could have just been b/c of something else??                                                                                           &nbs! p;                                                >> 39. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? i won't answer that for fear of em or lisa calling me cheesy, but i would like to have a significant amount of cash around
>> 41. Which single store would you choose to Max you credit card:  5-7-9-... just kidding- i am a big fan of banana, ann taylor and i know i am getting too old, but i still like express                                                                                                                              >> 42.

Name the person that you are friends with that lives the farthest away? Emily, although during the week the drive from the old cy-creek stomping grounds to meet lisa and susan seems almost impossible.                                            &nbs! p;                                                  >> 44.

is probably incomplete).


Thanks,
Paul Thomas

"FW: Competitive Analysis Update- US Attacks Afghanistan #2","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Johnston, Robert

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update- US Attacks Afghanistan #2
Importance:	High

Update below on ground campaign strategy & timing, as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments. Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.

Call with questions.

RJ

1.	Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate

With a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.

Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.

When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that ""reasonable elements"" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.

2.	Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure

Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.

Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.

3.	Pakistan Holding Steady- For Now

Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.

4.	Key Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?

There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.

"NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY","The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

"","Susan:
Are you there? Drop a line as you have time. I am here for the next week or
so in England. I was in Milan Italy for fashion week and then 4 days later
was in Portland as I picked up a priest friend from there and brought him
back to England for a 2 week holiday. Thus, I think I have spent more time
on airlines than I have with my two feet placed on the ground. How are you?
What are you up to? Are you working or still lamenting a potential change?
Let me know...
Best to you,
Tobin
p.s. I will be in Houston for the entire month of April and half of May.
Shall we do lunch?

"ENA Gas Structuring","
In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

 mostly we make attacks on her and fighters like F-14s and F-18's come up
and intercept us.  We are carrying electronic pods which jam and deceive
their radars and everybody gets some good training.  Yesterday I just got
out to the area which is south of San Clemente island off the coast of
Southern California and had a generator failure.  I was with another A-4

"RE: 'Progress Summary' updates","Susan,
 
Your progress notes were in the tracking sheet, I just didn't notice them last night.  Sorry about that.
 
If you plan on revising the curves in the 'Revised Price' column of the templates, don't bother updating the summary sheet until you've done that.  Remember, if you do revise a portion of the curve, that revised piece needs to be copied and pasted into the next day's template in Column D.  Essentially, the summary sheet should be filled in when a date's curve has either been validated or revised and is awaiting review by Ed.
 
If you can complete all your basis curves by the end of the week so Ed can review and sign-off, that would be great.
 
I hope this clears things up.  Let me know if you have any questions,
 
Tim Bowler

Tim,
 
The NGI-Socal basis curves have been entered for all dates that there are actually broker quotes.  The curves have not been shaped within seasons at this point, but all data has been entered.  Also, NGI-PG&E Citygate basis entry has begun and should be completed tomorrow morning (yet again, only for those dates we have actual quotes).  I updated the 'Progress Summary' worksheet before I left this evening, I'm not sure why it does not appear to reflect this information.  The first broker quotes for the west were sent to me on Wednesday, February 13.  I hope to have all of the basis curves completed before the end of the week.  Please let me know if this timeline is unacceptable.
 
Thank you,
Susan Scott

Since the 'Progress Summary' worksheets are blank for all regions, I'm assuming that no curves have been validated for any dates at close-of-business today (2/18/02).

The reason I'm confirming this is because I'm being asked for a daily status update.  Please remember to update your respective 'Progress Summary' sheets daily prior to going home.  They are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas.

Focus your validation on the first week of Dec. initially.  Once that week is done, focus on the next week (and so on). 

Thanks for your efforts, 

Tim Bowler

"","Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, ""Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like."" And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. ""You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?""

The male statue looked at the female and asked, ""Do you want to do it
again?""
""Oh, yes!"" the female statue said. ""But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!""

"Watkins Outage","I just talked to Chris Kennedy, she informed me that Amoco will be taking down their liquids line that feeds the Wattenberg plant for the entire months of August and September.  What that means is that the gas flows into CIG at Watkins/Box Elder will be reduced.  She says by 15% but I don't know if that's entirely correct.  This hurts us on the Thermo deal, delivered to Skyline, due to the fact that these two receipt points are the only points that work on our discounted transportation.  I don't think we will have too much trouble buying DJ supplies during the peak of the summer but keep your eyes open for any Watkins/Box Elder supply.  We also need to start working CIG for a discount on other receipt points.

Paul 


PS  Make sure if you are using the CIG Skyline DISCOUNTED transportation at receipt points other than Watkins and Box Elder we are requesting discounts for these additional points.  Otherwise we will be paying max rate!

Susan,
These are some pictures of my friend Jimmy that I keep telling you about.  He went to the Naval Academy and is now out somewhere in the middle of the ocean.  Maybe when he gets back he'll move to Houston or Seattle...  He's perfect for you.  Tall, cute, and very smart.  How was the interview??

To Everyone:

Attached are some pictures of Jimmy that just arrived from the Teddy
Roosevelt.   I think they carry one of everything they own with them on
these flights.  Hope you all enjoy these photo's.   Jimmy is handing an
enlisted man a mock check for $49,000+ dollars for re-enlisting in the
nuclear surface fleet.  The sailor will get 1/2 in cash and the balance
over the term of his enlistment.

"thought that this would be appreciated","I thought that this is something to think about as we contemplate war... I have to admit that I am caught between the feelings of needing to act with violence to defend and needing to act with compassion to understand.

What can you do TODAY...this very moment?
A central teaching in most spiritual traditions is: What you wish to experience, provide for another. 
Look to see, now, what it is you wish to experience-in your own life, and in the world. Then see if there is another for whom you may be the source of that. 
If you wish to experience peace, provide peace for another. 
If you wish to know that you are safe, cause another to know that they are safe. 
If you wish to better understand seemingly incomprehensible things, help another to better understand. 
If you wish to heal your own sadness or anger, seek to heal the sadness or anger of another. 
Those others are waiting for you now. They are looking to you for guidance, for help, for courage, for strength, for understanding, and for assurance at this hour. Most of all, they are looking to you for love.

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"Important Information About Security & ClickAtHome","
Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!

"Bingo Bash Invite...","Hey y'all,

Here are some more details about the ""Back to School Bingo Bash""
benefiting KIPP Academy.  I am a member of the National Charity League
Juniors group, and we are holding this event on tonight, Monday, September
24th
at the Continental Club.  If any of you have ever been to ""Monday
Night Bingo"" at the Continental Club to watch the El Orbits play and
play bingo - you know how much fun it is!

This should prove to be even more fun!  Not only will we have great time
playing bingo and listening to the El Orbits - but we will also have
prizes available that you can purchase opportunity tickets for!!!
(Just like a raffle, but NOT a raffle because we do not have a license
for a raffle - we just have the opportunity to win prizes).  So - be
sure and bring **CASH** for the opportunity tickets.

The link below explains more about:
*    the Bingo Bash event, drink specials, and directions
*    links to learn more about KIPP Academy
*    links to learn more about the El Orbits

Also, attached is a spreadsheet with a list of some of the prize packages
available.

I hope to see you guys there!!!  Thanks for helping out KIPP Academy!

"Confirmation Process","We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.  All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.  Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.  All broker deals will be handled this way.

Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.  This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.

Anne, please communicate this to your group.

"Re: visit","
Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

  Susan.M.Scott@enron.com wrote:  Sorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and
subsequently exhausted on Sunday. I basically rotated from my bed to the
couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed. Pitiful but much needed.
Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.
Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into
Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday. You can either call or
email if you have any questions for me. And, I'll decide where I'd like to
go for the long weekend. I may pick two and just let you two decide the
final destination.

ARE YOU A BITCH????? 
Some friends were sitting at the bar talking about their professions. 
The first guy says ""I'm a Y.U.P.P.I.E, you know.... 
Young, Urban, Professional, Peaceful; Intelligent; Ecologist"" 
The second guy says ""I'm a D.I.N.K, you know.... 
Double Income, No Kids."" 
The third guy says, ""I'm a R.U.B., you know... 
Rich, Urban, Biker."" 
They turn to the woman and ask her, ""What are you?"" 
She replies: ""I'm a WIFE, you know.... 
Wash, Iron, F***, Etc."" 
A second gal answers their question before they even ask it: 
""BITCH ""So, just exactly what is a BITCH??????????"" They ask in unison. 
* B- BABE 
* I- IN 
* T- TOTAL 
* C- CONTROL of 
* H- HERSELF 
> 
So ladies, next time somebody calls you ""Bitch""...SMILE......and say Thank 
You!!!!!!!! 
MAKE A WOMAN HAPPY! 
PASS THIS ONE ON TO AS MANY WOMEN AS YOU KNOW!

"FW: 'Progress Summary' updates","Since the 'Progress Summary' worksheets are blank for all regions, I'm assuming that no curves have been validated for any dates at close-of-business today (2/18/02).

The reason I'm confirming this is because I'm being asked for a daily status update.  Please remember to update your respective 'Progress Summary' sheets daily prior to going home.  They are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas.

Focus your validation on the first week of Dec. initially.  Once that week is done, focus on the next week (and so on).

Thanks for your efforts,

Tim Bowler
