"A.Word.A.Day--opsimath","opsimath (OP-si-math) noun

   One who begins learning late in life.

[From Greek opsi- (late) + math (learning).]

   ""The question, of course, is whether Paul underwent such a system in
   his youth or, like many before and after him, was either an opsimath
   or a natural-born rhetorician.""
   Stanley B Marrow, Liberating Words, The Catholic Biblical Quarterly
   (Washington), Jul 1998.

""Always remember that you are unique. Just like everyone else."" Like all
genuine humor, this waggish remark carries a grain of truth. There are six
billion of us around, and we are very different - in our demeanor, diction,
and dreams; in our fingerprints, retinal patterns, and DNA sequences.

Yet, no matter which hand we write with, what language we speak, or what we
eat, there is something that binds us all, whether it is our preference for
a life free from fear, in our efforts to make this world better for us and
for others, or in our appreciation of beauty of the soul and our longing
for love.

With so many people, so many shared traits, and so many differences, there's
no wonder we have so many words to describe people. This week we look at
five of them.                                                        -Anu

"A.Word.A.Day--camorra","camorra (kuh-MOR-uh) noun

   A secret group united for unscrupulous purposes.

[After Camorra, a secret organization in Naples, Italy, engaged in
criminal activities, mostly during the 19th century. From Italian, possibly
from Spanish (dispute).]

   ""Granted, the public's taste in art could be called naive by the elitist
   standards of the camorra of collectors, gallery owners and museum
   curators who control the art world.""
   American Pop, The Nation (New York), Mar 14, 1994.

"Continental Customer Advisory","Dear Ms. Scott,

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel:

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft.

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure.

Any thoughts on Tasters this month?  At the Christmas one we talked about

"RE: Food left in the refrigerator","
FYI - I have had numerous complains that the refrigerator in the main kitchen had a funny odor, and was told to call housekeeping. Housekeeping came by today to throw away food that was old, I monitored her and saw that she only threw away stuff that smelled bad or was already growing something on it! In order for her to air out the refrigerator she will need you to take your food home so that she is able to clean and sanitize the refrigerator.

Please see to it that you notify your group to take home all food containers.


Thank you,
Melissa Solis

Subject: Booth's escape...
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/sockdolager.html

I commend your choice of the word ""sockdolager"" and its unique place in
American history, but I have to differ with you on your history:

""Booth fired his gun at that precise moment to muffle the loud noise
of his shot with the guffaws from the audience, and quietly escaped.""

That certainly was his plan, but it didn't work out that way. Mary Lincoln
shrieked when Abe slumped over with blood on his head, and Booth struggled
briefly with Major Rathbone, slashing him badly with the big knife he was
also carrying. Then Booth attempted to vault from the Presidential box to
the stage. He was an accomplished athlete and might have made the 10-12
foot jump had not his spur caught on the bunting around the railing. He
landed askew on one foot and broke his ankle, which did not prevent him from
hobbling off in the confusion, while shouting something that is most often
reported as ""Sic semper tyrannis!"" (""Thus with all tyrants!"" -- the state
motto of Virginia).

Incidentally, Booth's broken leg was treated by Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was
later, probably wrongly, accused of being one of the assassination
conspirators and exiled to the Dry Tortugas. Because of his heroic actions
during a yellow fever epidemic there a few years later, he was pardoned, but
his name gave rise to another American colloquialism: ""Your name is mud.""

   Thanks for your correction on Booth's ""quiet"" escape. That was quite
   an escape. Unfortunate incrimination of Dr. Mudd may have helped
   popularize the idiom but it didn't originate with him. It existed many
   years earlier.                                               -Anu

Subject: Sockdolager

I've been fortunate enough to go river rafting on the Colorado River
through the Grand Canyon. Between mile 78 and 79 there is a rapid to run
that is both exceptional and outstanding (rated a 9 on the grade 10 scale
of difficulty). The rapid is named Sockdolager because, as our river
guide warned us, ""it packs quite a wallop"". He was ever so correct, and
I'd do the entire trip over again just to ride those particular waves.

--------------------------------

From: Judy Gustafson (kb6unf@aol.com)
Subject: Sockdolager

The word, ""sockdolager,"" also made its way into Twain's Huck Finn. In
chapter twenty, Twain writes,

""... about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and
lighten like everything; ... a body don't see such a storm as that
every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did
scream along! And every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up
the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'd see the islands
looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the
wind; then comes a h-whack! -- bum! bum!
bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away, and quit -- and then rip comes another flash and
another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft
sometimes....""

--------------------------------

From: Ed Tabor (thousandyears@aol.com)
Subject: Presidents' Day

Despite the fact that the birthdays of Lincoln and Washington were officially
separate until 1971, only Washington's birthday was a federal holiday, and
only Washington's birthday was a bank holiday in most states.

The move to have all official holidays be observed on Mondays to provide
three-day weekends, pleasant as the results are for all of is, was primarily
the result of very heavy lobbying of Congress by the hotel and travel
industries. Long weekends enable more of us to travel.

   I've received a few other messages about this. Some said moving
   holidays to Monday was to avoid a four- or five-day weekend. Others
   claimed it was to save on heating/cooling costs. -Anu

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--bloviate
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/bloviate.html

President Warren G. Harding is also partially responsible for adding another
cobbled word to the English language. A grammarian wag once commented that,
""Harding came from a small Ohio town called Normalcy to which he constantly
desired to return.""

From: Sam Robinson (robinsons@un.org)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--watergate
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/watergate.html

The suffix ""-gate"" seems to be used not just in English. Indonesia has had
amongst its big headline-makers over recent years:

Baligate - a scam that relieved Bank Bali of about US$70 million during its
bail-out by the state
Bruneigate - the alleged misappropriation of a multi-million dollar gift
from the Sultan of Brunei
Buloggate - the alleged theft of funds from State-Owned Enterprise BULOG
... and in keeping with the American origin of the suffix, there was even a
Hollywood flavoured Buloggate II.

From: Gerard McEwen (grmce@cobweb.com.au)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--watergate

During the recent Australian Federal election the Government propagated the
false story that asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard when
confronted by H.M.A.S. Adelaide. As this story unravelled in Senate
Estimates hearings a letter writer to 'The Australian' newspaper referred
to it as 'childreninthewatergate'.

From: Earl Bender (earl@avenel.com)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--throttlebottom
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/throttlebottom.html

As one of the few folks who have probably ever seen Of Thee I Sing
performed, I concur that it is quite a funny and sometimes brutal satire.
For me, the funniest running gag continuing through the whole production is
that Throttlebottom cannot get a Washington, D.C. library card because no
one will recognize the Vice President as a person or a job.

From: Lee Hartsfeld (hartsfl@nationwide.com)
Subject: Presidential connections

This week you promised ""words with presidential connections,"" but ""Enron""
has yet to appear. Or ""Lay.""

--------------------------------

From: Joe Chapline (joechap@srnet.com)
Subject: dactyls

In choosing Wintergreen and Throttlebottom as the names for the two
candidates, (Pres. and VP) the authors of ""Of Thee I Sing"" reflect the
law of the tripod. A tripod can always find stability no matter how
rough the ground under it. The dactyl is the ""tripod"" of language. It
represents stability and gives a feeling of comfort and is easy to remember.

The names of the two candidates, Wintergreen and Throttlebottom reflect
this point of sensitivity. Wintergreen is a dactyl; Throttlebottom, with
four syllables, clatters and suggests instability. He is likely to be the
loser, or to come in second, in an election.

The mottoes that have become famous are all tripods: ""Liberty, Equality,
and Fraternity;"" and "" Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness."" Winston
Churchill tried to break the mold with ""Blood, Sweat, Toil, and Tears""
but the world has cut him down to size by eliminating one of his travails:
Today it is ""Blood, Sweat and Tears."" ""Toil"" has dropped out for
contributing ""instability"" to the motto. If tripods are so stable, where
did nature get our five-dactyl hands? The three-toed sloth would seem to
have the edge on us.

Some of our fresh arrivals include Amores  Perros  (that's Love's a Bitch for all those who no habla  espanol), an Academy Award
 Nominee for Best Foreign  Language Film (it lost to that pesky Crouching Tiger)  that many considered one of the best films of last year.  Continuing on the Oscar-tip, we also have Academy Award
  Nominee Juliette Binoche in The  Widow of St. Pierre  and Songcatcher ,  a folksy romance (think O Brother Where Art Thou?,  but good) starring Aidan Quinn and Tumbleweeds' Janet  Mcteer.   And  this is just the beginning of some of the great films that  will be appearing on CinemaNow   in the coming months. February promises to be our biggest  month ever (okay, it's the shortest month, but it will seem  huge). Lots of new films, special promotions, contests,  added downloads and more. I'm giddy just thinking about  it.  Enjoy  the films!    CinemaNow Watch Movies Here!     [IMAGE] ?  Copyright 2001 CinemaNow. All rights reserved. Privacy  Policy .

"NEW Document Available From CAEM","
***** NEW Documents Available From CAEM Free of Charge *****
 
The Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM) is pleased to announce the availability of two ground-breaking documents -- ""The Role of the Federal Government in Distributed Energy"" and ""The Role of the Default Provider in Restructured Energy Markets"" -- that are available free of charge.  To access the documents, visit us at our web site -- www.caem.org  
 
After over 6 months of intensive work by CAEM's Distributed Energy Task Force, CAEM is releasing a comprehensive report on the ""THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN DISTRIBUTED ENERGY"" prepared by Nat Treadway, a CAEM Senior Research Fellow, and Ed Reid, CAEM's Senior Technology Fellow.  
 
The report describes the major Federal government activities that encourage or hamper the commercialization of distributed energy (DE) and recommends changes that could allow DE to play a more significant role as a choice among competing energy services.  The overarching conclusion of the report is that unless the Federal government takes affirmative steps to promote DE, the existing policies, regulations, and business practices will continue to hamper its development.  The report makes a number of recommendations that will be important to policymakers at both the federal and state levels of government.  This 70-page report is a must read for stakeholders interested in distributed energy.  
 
A white paper on ""THE ROLE OF THE DEFAULT PROVIDER IN RESTRUCTURING ENERGY MARKETS"" was prepared by Ron Sutherland, a CAEM Scholar, as part of CAEM's DISCO of the Future Forum.  
 
The paper offers an insightful analysis and critique of the current models utilized by states to offer default service.  The conclusions are summarized at the end of the paper, but the main result is noted here. Each state implicitly adopts a model of competition in its electricity and gas markets.  This model then influences (if not determines) the choice of default provider.  The commonly accepted model of competition permits the local utility to remain a competitor in the merchant function, where the utility is likely to be the default provider.  In the restructuring efforts of those few states where the utility exits the merchant function, an energy supply company is likely to be the default provider.  Various risks, inefficiencies or non-competitive elements do not result from the choice of default provider, but from other elements in the transition process.  Price caps are the major factor contributing to risks and inefficiencies where the utility or an independent energy provider is the default provider.  That is, it is not the default service provider framework, per se, that is responsible for the risks. The purpose of this study is descriptive not prescriptive, however a tentative suggestion is offered.  Few customers will require default service if energy service providers have incentives to offer service at pricing and other terms that cover costs.  If the need for default service occurs, customers will most likely obtain service if the default provider can offer service at pricing and other terms that cover costs.

"A.Word.A.Day--hotsy-totsy","hotsy-totsy (HOT-see TOT-see) adjective, also hotsie-totsie

   Just right; perfect.

[Coined by Billy De Beck, cartoonist (1892-1942), famed for his comic
strip ""Barney Google and Snuffy Smith"". Another of his coinage that has
found a place in the English language dictionaries is heebie-jeebies
meaning jitters or creeps (See AWAD archives, August 1997).]

   ""(Billy Bob) Thornton has played unfathomable, soulful characters
   before. He was the ace air traffic controller in Pushing Tin, who
   baffles his colleagues by getting the hotsy-totsy girl.""

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Mr. Max has the answer!

What's that I hear, Sonny and Cher singing, ""The Beat Goes On?""  Is it a new
week, new sale, or just a new incarnation of last week's sale?  Who knows?  But
here is what I think is driving it and what you need to do to take advantage.

Over the past three weeks, my family and I flew a combined 40 segments as we
winged our way to Grandma's house in Florida and then off to Rome for New
Year's Eve.  We traveled on the 20th, 26th 27th and 31st of December with less
than a handful of seats available on any of the flights, including the two
Trans-Atlantic 747-400 legs.  So if the planes are so full, why are the sales
continuing you ask?  Well, the way I see it is this.  While flights over the
next two to three weeks are fairly full, the long range loading for seats a
month or more out is extremely low.  Travelers seem to be waiting for the next
sale to come along before they purchase.  While this ""wait for the next Billy
Goat"" may have seemingly worked for the troll, in about two months, we will be
entering a period when folks will be planning their summer vacations and
frankly, the sales will dry up.  Remember too, that the airlines have cut
capacity by some 20% through reduced flights or smaller equipment.  So friends,
the bottom line is this...""The time to hesitate is through, no time to wallow
in the mire,"" time to really start looking at your late spring and early summer

"A.Word.A.Day--dramaturg","dramaturg (DRAM-uh-turj) noun, also dramaturge or dramaturgist

   1. A playwright, especially one affiliated with a specific theater
      company.

   2. A member of a theater company staff who selects, edits, and adapts
      plays for performance, and writes program notes.

[From French, from Greek dramatourgos.]

   ""The script, Shakespeare's second-longest, has been very well cut by
   Russotto and dramaturg Cam Magee (who did the impressive surgery on
   `Cymbeline'). It retains its vigor while losing all the extraneous
   stuff about Richard's dull, royal relatives.""
   Lloyd Rose, `Richard III': A Slithering Monarch for Our Times,
   The Washington Post, Nov 20, 1997.

   ""In his turn, George C. White, the founder of the O'Neill center and its
   board chairman, said of Mr. Richards: 'What is known as the O'Neill
   Process should rightfully be known as the Richards Process. Lloyd
   instituted the practice of dramaturgs who work as go-betweens between
   director and playwright.'""
   N. Graham Nesmith, A Stage Champion's Summertime Good-bye,
   The New York Times, Jul 18, 1999.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Okay, you've got the deal of the year on airfare, so now what?

You have been watching the sales and have managed to pick up round trip tickets
from your hometown to Palm Beach, Florida for under $200. Tickets in hand, it's
time to fill in the gap between your PBI arrival and departure.  Let's see now,
you will need a rental car, a hotel room, some entertainment or activities and
meals, to go along with vegging on the beach during your stay.  Here are some
quick ways to stretch your bucks.

The car part is easy, pick your favorite and book it.  Keep an eye on coupons
you may have and remember that some could cost you more than the negotiated
rates on carwiz.com.  When you arrive at the airport, look for signs that say
""Cars Available"" and ask for an upgrade or better rate.

A quick trip to http://ehotel.onetravel.com will show available hotels in West
Palm Beach.  Interested in one on the beach?  Click on the ""Location Map""
button to get the properties' proximity to the beach and highways.  For
entertainment, visit http://palmbeaches.com/attrac/index.html for attractions
and activities.

The meals part of the trip can make or break your whole getaway!  How about a
list of restaurants from which to choose prior to arrival AND a 20% discount on
the food portion of your bill?  There are lots of ways to save using various
discount plans but one I find attractive is In Good Taste.  For a limited time,
a free one-year membership is available to those who register via
http://11thhour.igtcard.com/11thhour/home.htm.   The best part of the plan is
that it is not limited to dining.  The IGT card is also good for dinner
cruises, dry cleaning and discounts to attractions and more.  It just might
become one of your most important travel cards as you discover what it can do
for you.

Finally, if Palm Beach is not in your plans, my pick of the week has to be this
alternative vacation:  http://www.icelandair.com/missiceland

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

"A.Word.A.Day--buskin","buskin (BUS-kin) noun

   1. A thick-soled, laced boot, reaching to knee or calf, worn by actors
      of ancient Greek and Roman tragedies. Also known as cothurnus.

   2. A tragic drama.

[Perhaps from Middle French brousequin.]

Words often form and come to acquire new meaning for peculiar reasons.
Because those big shoes were often worn by tragedians, we came to
refer to a tragedy itself as a buskin. A counterpart of buskin is
sock (a comedy) after soccus, a lightweight low shoe worn by Greek
and Roman comic actors.                                         -Anu

   ""`My vein,' wrote Corneille, `often combines the lofty buskin with
   the comic sock, and ... pleases the audience by striking contrasting
   notes.'""
   Linda Winer, Corneille With Kushner's Help, Newsday (New York),
   Jan 20, 1994.

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON EIGHT - Hotels, what's your choice?

Truly, the hardest part of any journey is ""where do we stay?""  With the exception of package deals that include air and hotel or car and hotel, you are pretty much on your own.  You can choose from B&B type accommodations, membership clubs (mostly in Europe), hostels, pensions, and small country inns to hotels and resorts.  Even within a category, accommodations can vary from basic to luxurious.  As a leisure traveler who travels a couple of times a year for a total of two to three weeks, does it make sense to stick with one brand?  Well maybe, but for those who travel less, taking advantage of offers and selecting airline miles over hotel rewards may make more sense.  For this lesson, let's look at some basic saving strategies.

Just as with flights, hotel rooms are priced depending on time.  Season, day of the week and so forth determine what hotels charge.  A subtle point is that many hotels also charge by their type and location.  That is, a business hotel located in an industrial area may charge top dollar during the week as business travelers work within a mile or so of the hotel.  On the weekend, that rate can plummet as the hotelier works to fill the rooms.  Obversely, the tourist hotel, located within walking distance of a ""Bunch O' Flags"" theme park and pizza haven, or on the strip in Las Vegas, will charge their highest rates on the weekend, doubling or even trebling the Sunday through Thursday night rate.

Taking advantage of these pricing anomalies can save you substantially if you book your rooms properly.  A feature found on http://ehotel.onetravel.com/index.cfm?action=homepage allows you to look at a specific time frame for several properties at once and view the per night room rate.  A quick look at Las Vegas will show rates for a seven-night stay at Circus Circus from $57 Sunday through Thursday to $106 for that same room Friday and Saturday night.  Is it possible to get that $106 rate down?  Sure just remember that many tourist destinations, including Las Vegas, have been experiencing lower occupancy.  So, armed with the reservation number from your online booking, call the property and ask for the reservation manager. Simply tell them that you have booked a week at their hotel and would be a happier guest if the rate didn't go up on the weekend.  Chances are that you will receive some sort of adjustment just by asking.

Your reading assignment is ""How To Get The Best Prices At The Best Properties"" under the Hotel section.  Click here http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL for access.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

Unfortunately, there was not a significant response to a dinner this year, so the ERC we will not be hosting a formal carbo loading.

Marathon Day

Just contact me at 713-432-6628 or moraap@chevrontexaco.com. I will do my very best to accommodate your schedule requests.  Remember, distance running doesn't build character, IT REVEALS IT!

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Same tune, different day!

As the old DJs used to say, ""The hits just keep on coming!""  I am beginning to
run out of superlatives for the sales we see with the hotels and airlines.  The
packages are unbelievable with prices I didn't think would ever be reached.
Visitor Bureaus are joining with Chamber of Commerce and are working to get
people traveling again.  Even Mickey has loosened up and is offering deals that
don't make you feel like you have walked into the world's biggest human trap
built by a rodent!  Just kidding Mick?  We love you!

Okay, here is the lowdown on what is happening.  Most of the current airline
sales end the 6th or the 8th of January.  Travel dates vary but most of the
best deals require travel in January and up until mid February.  There are
excellent values beyond this cutoff and well into spring but again, the best
are for the next 45 days.

International travel is just as good or better.  I saw a United fare from JFK
(New York) to Heathrow (London, UK) for $178...throw in the approximately $80
for taxes and fees and you are right around $260 round trip!  Can you imagine
an Asian round-trip for between $400 and $750 depending on where you live?  The
very first time I flew to Tokyo was in 1964 from Seattle.  The cost then was
nearly $800...today it is almost half!

Hotels are still offering; buy one night, get a weekend night free.  Some are
doing the pay for three and get the fourth free.  Prices are down around 50%
over the same period last year.  Some Marriott properties have prices beginning
at $39 per night.  Now, understand that this will not get you the Marriott
Marquis on Times Square but even this hotel is much cheaper than last year.

The only travel segment that is not advertising deeply discounted specials is
rental cars.  But even here, when you approach the counter, negotiate the rate.
 If they stand firm, talk upgrade or try the next counter.

Finally, I hope you all have a safe and prosperous New Year and all your
Contrails are Happy!

See you on a flight soon,


Bob

"A.Word.A.Day--psychobabble","psychobabble (SIE-ko-bab-uhl) noun

   Language laden with jargon from psychotherapy or psychiatry used
   without much concern for accuracy.

[Coined by journalist Richard Dean Rosen (1949- ). From Greek combining
form psycho- (mind) + babble (drivel, blather)].

Here is how Rosen describes the term in his 1997 book ""Psychobabble: Fast
Talk and Quick Cure in the Era of Feeling"" :

""Psychobabble is ... a set of repetitive verbal formalities that kills off
the very spontaneity, candor, and understanding it pretends to promote. It's
an idiom that reduces psychological insight to a collection of standardized
observations, that provides a frozen lexicon to deal with an infinite
variety of problems.""

   ""Only a few missteps jar the play's dreamy atmosphere. Unable to resist
   knee-jerk references to Freud and Jung, Ms. Zimmerman has her actors
   spout some psychobabble about myths as public dreams, dreams as private
   myths, and the like.""
   Amy Gamerman, Theater: A Timely Gift of Timeless Ovid, The Wall Street
   Journal (New York), Oct 10, 2001.

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON SEVEN - Travel Clubs, a good idea?

There are several travel clubs now purporting to offer exceptional savings to their members.  The first type offers very low cost or even free airfare if you simply book your hotel with them.  Many have a one week minimum stay requirement and charge rates which far exceed what the smart traveler can find using free online services or a mainline agency for both the cost of air and hotel.  A second membership program says they will save you 50% off published hotel rates.  They will, but that is 50% of the highest rate.  It's easy to find discounts aplenty just using credit cards, AAA, AARP or other memberships.  The third type requires you join just to see the deals.  However, the restrictions, once viewed, may be too many to be of any advantage.  Before I pay, I want the full story, so I want to get full disclosure.  Ask to ""visit"" ""Members Only"" areas.  If they will not provide full disclosure or a free tour then remember your Latin...  Caveat Emptor!

Here is a club deal example.  A site is touting New York to European destinations for ""Only $249.""  Wow! What a deal!  I e-mailed the company to get details and total price.  This site charges a $50 membership fee, but before I pay, I want to make sure that what I see is what I pay.  Problem is that so far, I have not received a reply and, doubt seriously if I will.  Why?  Well, you don't get the total price until you join and unless I am wrong, taxes, customs and immigration fees, security costs and segment taxes are not included in the $249.  Nowhere in the hype on the main page or the description does it mention a thing about taxes or fees other than the fuel and charges that ""may"" be additional.  So, what are the taxes and fees to Europe from New York?  About $115.  The total cost for this deal?  $249+115+50 (membership fee) = $414.  A good deal?  Sure, if you didn't look at other sites where you will find prices right around $341.  Now, if you travel to Europe more than!
 twice a year, joining might pay off.   But overall, you will probably do better without a membership.  I believe it is better to rely on newsletters such as this and SideStep.com's to really find the deals.

See you on a flight soon,


Bob

   ""In a suburban town in Connecticut, Cora Felton has some small measure
   of notoriety as the Puzzle Lady, reputed constructor of syndicated

Hi Larry,

Just wanted to see how you're doing these days.  I'm glad to hear things are finally up and running and that you all have stuff to do now.  I'm with the rest of the lepers down on the fourth floor these days.  We'll have to round up a group to grab a drink after work sometime.

Hi Joe,
 
I'm actually out of town today visiting family.  I just wanted to let you know that Kathy is pretty up to date on where I stand with the west curves.  What little information I do have was only obtained Wednesday afternoon, so not to much has been entered in to the file.  It appears we have quotes from at least one broker for the following days: 12/12/01-12/21/01, 12/31/01, 01/02/12.  I have talked to a few people from west-risk who are trying to track down more information.  I will forward the emails with attachments which I have recieved to yourself and feel free to grab what I have printed out from my desk (all data is simply sitting in front of my keyboard).  I have printed out all the days we currently have and attached the sheet confirming which broker provided the information and on what day.  Hope this helps.
 
Thanks,
Susan
 
Please reply back and let me know if you recieved the information as I am having some difficulty with my email.

All, 

Attached is a spreadsheet of Enron's curve names for the West book.  We just need a quick status on the broker quotes you have and the ones still needed/missing.  Please review the curves against the broker data you have (including electronic files), and indicate any gaps.

Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data.  Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on saving money on travel.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON ONE - Choices

While this may seem like a strange place to start saving money, it can be the most important part of traveling better and more affordably. In order to be successful in obtaining reduced fares and rates through discount coupons and special offers, you must give special consideration when selecting a travel provider's frequency program.  These programs can offer you valuable travel discounts such as free flights, hotel stays and rental car promotions. There are several factors in determining which travel partners you choose.

First, examine your travel patterns, plans and goals.  Since most vacations include at least some air travel, select an airline alliance that best meets your needs. Next, you will want a hotel plan that works with the airline plan and optimizes your point/mile earning potential.  It is important to remember that affinity cards associated with an airline or hotel chain can easily double your miles and points.  Often times, a travel partner will specify offers linked to a specific credit card.  Consider your telecommunication services in the planning stage as this too can amass points quickly. In this group we find local service, long distance, cell and Internet service.  Finally, rental cars still give points, but not as they used to.  Fifty miles a day is the norm for most agencies, so while they don't add up as quickly as other points, they will provide some clout as a member of their frequent renter program.

Now, if I were a neophyte, I would look long and hard at Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan.  Their program has some unique features that actually caused me to recommend their plan to a traveler in Miami!  Why?  Well, their plan allows miles earned on over ten airlines to be deposited into your Mileage Plan account, and as an added bonus, you can even earn elite status on Alaska without ever having set foot on the fleet with the Aleut on the tail!  Elite status brings special offers and even reduced award redemption in many cases.  In addition to airlines, you can earn miles by staying at over 35 hotel brands from Best Western to Westmark, seven car rental companies and a dozen miscellaneous partners which include Amtrak, Sprint and FTD.com make this my ""best to join"" program for 2002.  Full terms, conditions and information can be found at http://www.alaskaair.com - click on Mileage Plan at the top of the page.

Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers' Corner, http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL chapters titled, ""Choosing Your Airline,"" under the Hotels section, read, ""Frequency Programs,"" and in the Other Good Stuff section, pick up tips in, ""Affinity Cards - Hidden Resources In Your Wallet.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

"Credit Union Changes","What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

It was on March 14, eight years ago, that A.Word.A.Day sent its first word.
While we observe our octennial next week, it's time for new initiatives.
We're considering launching an ad-free, paid subscription service, in
addition to continuing the existing free service. Details to follow.

--------------------------------

From: Mike Pope (mpope@microsoft.com)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--impresario
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/impresario.html

The word of the day reminded me of this quote. It's from Rossini, the Italian
composer and apparently a famous procrastinator, reminiscing in a letter on
""the best time to compose an overture"":

Wait until the evening before opening night. Nothing primes inspiration more
than necessity, whether it be the presence of a copyist waiting for your work
or the prodding of an impresario tearing his hair. In my time, all the
impresarios in Italy were bald at thirty.

--------------------------------

From: Janelle Forgette (janfor@nelsononline.com)
Subject: Impresario

In my Italian Language class, we learned about the customs surrounding
funerals, and that the person or company that arranges them is called an
""impresario"". I thought it almost amusing at the time, since we associate
that title with the world of entertainment, and I hadn't thought of funerals
in that light.

Thanks to your definition, it now makes complete sense to me, and explains
why the English name for the person who arranges funerals is ""undertaker"".
That title though is probably being taken over by ""funeral director"" - less
gloomy sounding, I suppose. But if we're headed in that direction, why not
go all the way to ""impresario"" and really brighten things up?

From: Kenneth L. Davis (kennethld@mindspring.com)
Subject: Re: buskin
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/buskin.html

After too many years, the penny drops: the name of my high school drama club
was ""Sock & Buskin"". I knew it referred to footwear, but the history was
never fully explained. Many thanks.

From: Cheryl La Montagne (clamontagne@eu.wcom.net)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--odeum
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/odeum.html

On a recent broadcast of LBC (London) they were having a discussion about
why cinemas were called Odeon in the UK and one explanation given was that
it was an acronym for Oscar Deutsch Entertains Our Nation. Oscar Deutsch
founded the Odeon chain.

--------------------------------

From: Jeb B. Raitt (raittjb@ssg.navy.mil)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--odeum

You wrote:
> Now you know why so many cinema halls are named Odeon.

Including Nickelodeon, was once the name of many theaters, then a music
machine.

And I can see why the theaters use the Greek rather than the Latin form.
""Odeum"" is much too much like ""odium"".

--------------------------------

From: Roy C Kepferle (rckepf@fuse.net)
Subject: Odeum

Odeum struck a chord in my memory of words to songs:

""Put another nickel in,
In the nickelodeon.
All I want is loving you,
And music, music, music.""

Eight or ten from our Colorado high school class of '44 held afternoon
impromptu dance sessions at our local cafe to the music of the day from
the jukebox (nickelodeon) in the corner. The cost per play then was five
cents, equal to the cost of a Coca-Cola.

"A.Word.A.Day--ukase","ukase (yoo-KAYS, yoo-KAYZ, YOO-kays, YOO-kayz) noun

   An arbitrary proclamation or order; edict.

[After ukaz, a decree issued by a Russian czar having the force of law.
From French, from Russian ukaz (decree), from Old Church Slavonic ukazu
(proof), from ukazati, from u- (at, away) + kazati (to show).]

   ""Guardian journalists are to be discouraged from signing petitions,
   speaking at public meetings, joining marches or, heaven forbid, standing
   for parliament, a ukase that would have dramatically affected the
   political ambitions of C P Scott, Morgan Phillips Price, Lena Jeger,
   Martin Linton, Polly Toynbee, Malcolm Dean, Christopher Huhne and,
   indeed, the present writer.""
   Richard Gott, The Lost Magic of Manchester, The New Statesman (London),
   Jan 28, 2002.

It was only a dozen years ago (March 14, 1990) that Mikhail Gorbachev was
elected to the presidency of the USSR, but it already seems an eternity,
considering the tremendous changes he unwittingly set off by his efforts
to modernize his regime.

When I was living in Moscow as a correspondent in the early seventies, no
one had the slightest idea that the entire communist edifice could collapse
as rapidly as it did after Gorbachev's well-intentioned tinkerings.

In those days the best brains of the West were expending a vast amount of
imagination (not to mention cold cash) trying to elucidate the mysteries of
the inner circles of power behind the great brick walls of Red Square. The
political science of choice was then known as Kremlinology.

Moscow was the capital city not of what we call Russia today, but of the
USSR -- the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -- and most of the Russian
language words with which we were familiar were derived from the
Marxist-Leninist ""newspeak"" which dominated everyday life, and which George
Orwell had caricatured with such devastating accuracy in ""Animal Farm"" and
""1984.""

Over the last dozen years an entirely new vocabulary, reflecting the
realities of the new, semi-democratic state, has consigned the old
political jargon to the dustbin of history. But let us not forget that
long before either of these Ivan-come-lately regimes had appeared on the
world stage, a third set of politico-economic realities had spawned a far
greater culture with its own rich vocabulary for our borrowing -- the
eternal Russia of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, Turgenyev, Chekhov and
many others. This sampling of Russian words dips into all three of these
historical periods. -Rudy Chelminski (rudychelminski@aol.com)

writer living in France.)

"A.Word.A.Day--winebibber","winebibber (WYN-bib-uhr) noun

   One who drinks too much wine.

[From Middle English wine + bib (to drink).]

   ""For devoted winebibber Thomas Jefferson, who drank the First Growths of
   Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Haut-Brion, Margaux) even before they were
   classified as such in 1855, one of his keenest disappointments was the
   failure to establish vineyards at Monticello.""
   Barbara Ensrud, Jefferson Would Be Proud, The Wall Street Journal
   (New York), Aug 1, 1997.

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

Spring break for Travel 101 - (We will resume the frugal travel course next week.)

Detroit's new terminal opens. Part Two - The New.  (Continued from last week.  For the complete story, click on link below.

Up at the crack of dawn, I checked in at Indy and spoke with other travelers about the new digs in Detroit.  All had horror stories about the old terminal and one recounted the days prior to the moving walkways when a trip from the ticket counter to the C concourse was indeed 15 minutes for the hale and hearty.  Enough talk about the old terminal, on to the new.

We arrived a little early at Detroit's NWA ""World Gate Way"" and there was some confusion getting to the gate but I suspect that was just first day jitters as ground controllers learned how to move aircraft in a ""corridor"" free environment.  The main stream press reported how Richard Anderson, CEO of Northwest, was on hand to greet the first few flights.  He didn't greet ours when it arrived at 9:17 AM, must have seen my name on the manifest.  Our arrival gate A-43 was near the center of the terminal and my connecting flight was out of A-1 literally over a half mile away.  However, the elevated tram that runs the length of the terminal was just a few feet away allowing the journey from A-43 to A-1 to be accomplished in under five minutes.  This alone sold me!

I intentionally planned the trip to allow three hours to really get to know the new facility.  I had been invited on a press tour but knew we would be shown what they wanted us to see and report about...the five Ws of course.  I wanted to see what travelers saw, after all, that's who it was built for, wasn't it?  Remember, my arrival was on a Sunday, an off travel day, but things went very smoothly.  Not all the shops were open but it was easy to see that one could buy just about anything they had forgotten to pack, including a Brooks Brother's suit.  Heck, if you were really late and couldn't pack, you could buy and fill a bag right there!  Restrooms were everywhere.  It was impossible to not see at least two for each gender simultaneously.  Newsstands were every 100 paces and a food court at the north end of the terminal covers you from soup to nuts!  Mid terminal, the main entry and exit point for travelers beginning or ending their journey in Detroit contains a huge wate!
r sculpture.  This should make an ideal meeting place if 5,000 people don't decide to use it all at once.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"A.Word.A.Day--kilkenny cats","kilkenny cats (kil-KEN-ee kats) noun

   People who fight relentlessly till their end.

[From a pair of proverbial cats in Kilkenny who fought till only their tails
were left.]

According to a story, some people in the town of Kilkenny in Ireland enjoyed
tying the tails of two cats and watching them fight till only their tales
were left behind. Most likely the story is a parable of a contest between
Kilkenny and Irishtown, two municipalities which fought about their boundaries
till little more than their tails were left. Here is a popular limerick
(another word that takes its origins from the name of an Irish town) about
the cats:

""There wanst was two cats of Kilkenny
Each cat thought there was one cat too many
So they fought and they fit
And they scratched and they bit
'Til instead of two cats there weren't any.""

   ""When Lord Cranborne placed Hatfield House at the disposal of Unionists
   to talk things through in November 1997, the result was a meeting after
   the style of the fighting Kilkenny cats.""
   A Man of Parts, The Economist (London), Apr 15, 2000.

   Excellent, distinguished.

[From Latin eximius (select, choice), from eximere (to take out, remove).]

""Example"" and ""exempt"" are examples of a few other words that are derived
from the same root.

   ""The dead greatness of the past is something Argentina is unable to

Usually the words in AWAD are organized in a theme but once in a while we
simply feature words that are engaging by themselves. Consider this a
cross-country drive through the dictionary, with no itinerary in hand. We'll
make several stops along the way, but who knows where we might stop and why?
Let's see what kind of words we might come across. Perhaps we'll meet words
that are long and short and unusual and uncommon, but all of them, just like
people, are interesting only if we care enough to learn about them.   -Anu

If you get an email titled ""My Party"" and the body of the email states:

""Hello!
My party... It was absolutely amazing!
I have attached my web page with new photos!
If you can please make color prints of my photos. Thanks!""

DO NOT open it, it is a virus. I have received an anonymous email from the
same sender about 10 times in a row. I looked it up on the Virus Alert web
page and it is a new virus going around.

Just wanted to warn everyone!

"A.Word.A.Day--euphemism","euphemism (YOO-fuh-miz-em) noun

   Use of a mild, neutral, evasive, or vague term in place of one considered
   taboo, offensive, blunt, or unpleasant.

[From Greek euphemismos, from euphemos (auspicious), from eu- + pheme
(speaking).]

   ""Two-and-a-half months after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, President
   Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the notorious Executive Order 9066. As a
   result, more than 110,000 Japanese, virtually all the Japanese-Americans
   on the mainland, were `evacuated to concentration camps' in remote parts
   of America's mountain states. The words were his, though they were soon
   replaced in official parlance by the euphemism, `reception centres'.""
   Books And Arts: The Consequences of Terror; Japanese Internment in
   America (book review), The Economist (London), Sep 22, 2001.

More examples:
collateral damage for civilian casualties,
second-hand for used,
pre-owned for second-hand,
pre-loved for pre-owned,
budget for cheap,
pass away for die,
sanitation worker for garbage collector,
convivial for drunkard.

"A.Word.A.Day--gonzo","gonzo (GON-zo) adjective

   Having a bizarre, subjective, idiosyncratic style, especially in
   journalism.

[Coined by Bill Cardoso, journalist and author, in 1971. It was first used in
a published work by Hunter S. Thompson, journalist and author (1939- ). Perhaps
from Italian gonzo (simpleton) or Spanish ganso (dull or fool, literally
a goose).]

  ""Gonzo chef! Surly and sexy! Outlaw in the kitchen! Anthony Bourdain's
   reputation not only precedes him, it also pretty much takes over for him.
   His 2000 best seller, 'Kitchen Confidential,' was a lurid snapshot of
   restaurant kitchens at their least appetizing.""
   Laura Shapiro, A Wandering Chef in Search of Adventures in Eating,
   The New York Times, Jan 8, 2002.

   ""I am reckless enough to risk a small proportion of the family's weekly
   income on backing my judgment of the likely outcome of a race. ... I do
   not count this as betting, more as gonzo journalism. I mean, how can I
   be expected to write about this stuff, without living it?""
   Martin Kelner, Screen Break: Wanna Bet Roy'll Wipe This One On His Sleeve?,
   The Guardian (London), Oct 22, 2001.

   No.

[From Russian nyet (no).]

   ""There's another difference between Silicon Valley and the corporate
   hierarchy In most companies there's only one place to pitch a new idea -
   up the chain of command--and just one nyet can kill it. In the Valley
   there's no one person who can say no to a new idea. It's rare to find

"Caycie's Bachelorette Party","Hello Girls!

I am getting so excited about Caycie's Bachelorette Party!  I hope everyone
has marked their calendars for the weekend of March 1-3.

Ann has graciously offered her house in Wimberly for the weekend.  What I
wanted to find out is... when do you think you could come in?  Would it be
more fun for everyone to come to Austin (at various times) and hang out at
Caycie's house?  Then everyone could caravan together to Ann's place on
Saturday morning?  Or would it be better for everyone to find their way to
Ann's at whatever time they can make it on Friday night?

The tentative plan is for us to have a lingere shower on Saturday during
lunch or in the afternoon and then go to Salt Lick on Saturday night for
dinner.

Let me know what you think and what your schedule permits.

Thanks,
Lisa

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Time to plan your spring break is now!

Ah, ""spring break.""  The memories that simple two-word phrase conjures up.
Seaside, Oregon...  March 1964...I wonder if they still have that warrant out
for me?  Oh well?

This Monday, United hit the streets with another sale, a zone sale.  That means
they have based fares on distance flown.  It took about 1.5 femtoseconds for
the rest of the industry to match United in the continuing saga of the sales.
Fares range from $98, plus the ubiquitous taxes and fees, for a trip from Los
Angeles to San Jose to $398 from New York to Seattle.  The usual black out
dates apply and purchases must be made by the 13th of February.  These fares
are good for travel until May 23.  Here is a Psssssst...A quick check of routes
for the same days on http://www.farebeater.com found as good or better fares on
identical routes or comparable routes using alternate airports.

Now, for you ""X-geners,"" AirTran is back in the X-fares swing with their ""one
price fits all segments.""  To get the $52 per segment fare, you should arrive
at the airport early and get on the standby list.  Now folks before you all
jump me, this is one of the very few standby fares in existence.  They are not
available for the general public.  So for those of you between 18 and 22, this
is a way to save some of your spring break money for next term's tuition...NOT!
 Travel between now and June 30, 2002.  Remember this is standby so allow
plenty of time on each end.  Don't show up at the airport June 30th for the
last flight and expect to get on it.

My pick of the litter is a Eurail SelectPass 5-day saver pass for $199, a
savings of over 30%.  This pass allows two or more people, traveling together,
first class rail travel on any five days in a two-month period. If you plan
your three ""adjoining"" countries properly, you can fly into Italy and visit all
of France, Italy and Greece.  Get to Greece using the free or discounted bonus
of the pass, a ferry trip from Brindisi, Italy to Patris, Greece.  From Patris,
it is an interesting trip to Athens and beyond.  The interesting part is that
this railroad is narrow gauge.  Don't try to drink from a full cup on this
route; you will spill!  Visit
http://onetravel.railkey.com/onetravel/specials.asp and click on Eurail Saver
Selectpass

See you on a flight, or train, soon,

Bob

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON Nine - Rental Cars...A thousand prices, a single car!

Ah, the rental car.  Easiest part of the trip?  For many, this spoils an entire vacation.

At first glance, one would think Rental Cars would be the simplest aspect of travel. Talk about prices varying. The airlines have nothing on the car folks. As far as I am concerned the only positive aspect or car rental is that a reservation is not a commitment! One or two companies tried to charge for reservations that were not kept but amid outcry, they stole quietly into the night.

Advance purchase pretends to exist, but some discount coupons can actually add 20% or more to the cost of a car.  At times, The best deal can happen at the counter without or in spite of a reservation.  If you are uninformed, the counter agent can convince you that your credit card won't cover your loss (many cards do, but check with the institution to be sure), and will proceed to sell you insurance you don't need.  Next, the agent tells you the compact you reserved is not available and the agent manages to upgrade you to what remains, a full size car.  The $19.95 per day compact car you reserved is now a $34 full size car.  Add the additional $20 in insurance and the fueling option for $20, even though you told the agent you needed the car for one day and were going downtown to a meeting and then back the next day, and we have a total cost for the $19.95 special of $74 plus 18% tax and a ""Concession Recovery Fee.""  Now we have a car that should have cost you $25 to $30 tot!
al with taxes, fees and the fuel you put in to top it off. You should have been upgraded at no charge due to non-availability of the compact, but you paid a whopping $90 or more! Wow, what happened?

Do your homework! First, join one or two rental car companies frequent renter programs. Don't pay the $50 initiation fee they ""require."" Simply call the customer service number at the agency headquarters and tell they you want to make their company your company and ask for a free membership.  Next, always know what your own insurance and credit cards will cover and do not allow yourself to be beaten up by some counter agent who gets to pocket part of the insurance premium and upgrade they sell you.  Finally, with thousands of various prices for the same car, always ask for the best deal and remember, when you get to the airport and see signs that say, ""Cars Available,"" that really means, ""Let's Deal.""

Your reading assignment is ""How To Avoid Being 'Beaten Up'"" under the Rental Car section.  Click here http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL for access.

See you on a flight soon,

"FROM CINDY OLSON, COMMUNITY RELATIONS: Body Shop Reopening","Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Blackout dates a thing of the past?

A few weeks back, Northwest eliminated black out dates for award travel.  Of
course they raised the number of miles required for award travel because they
believed travelers found it difficult to understand the nuances of peak and off
peak awards.  Puleeeeeez!  Anyhow, not long after the NWA announcement, their
partners came on board followed by United, American, Delta and others.  So, are
you going to be able to save some cash and book normally expensive holiday
trips using miles?  I doubt it!  Here's why.

All frequent flyer seats are released on a ""not to interfere with revenue""
basis.  Airlines know historically what seats they will sell and which they
will not.  The ones they do not sell are released to awards.  Since the
airlines sell virtually every seat on December 23rd and 24th, along with seats
on the 26th through the 29th, don't expect to find any seats available...at
least not now.  The same holds true for the period around the 4th of July.  Put
simply, award seats are allotted to days and flights the airlines believe they
can not fill with revenue passengers.  So while there are no black out dates
per se, they really do exist since seats will not be available on peak travel
dates!

But wait, there is hope!  Yield Management, the practice of pricing and
re-pricing, seats every few seconds to get maximum revenue, is also working for
the frequent flyer with miles to spend.  Recently, it has been possible to
redeem miles at the last minute as airlines release seats that remain unsold.
While this method is not for the faint of heart, you can get seats to good
destinations.  Flexibility in travel dates is important and creativity in
routing may also be necessary as getting from A to B may require a visit of C
and D along the way.  Remember, too, that your best chances are with carriers
with multiple partners like Alaska Airlines.  Using an Alaska award, you can
get from Houston to Seattle on Continental, American, or Northwest.  A simple
form on their site
https://mileageplan.alaskaair.com/ssl/partner/PartnerForm.asp will get you
started and, they will check all their partners for you.  At Northwest, you can
book awards online and their system checks partners automatically.  Visit
https://www.nwa.com/cgi-bin/atrredir.cgi for more information.  Patience can
pay!

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

"Caycie's Bachelorette","Hi girls!

Caycie's Bachelorette is only 3 weeks away!  I hope all of you got your
invitations - thank you, Bate, for doing those!  If you haven't please send
me an email.  I am also assuming that you can all come, so if you can't,
please email me too.

I wanted to take a poll on something... I thought it may be fun to get a
manicure and/or peticure when we are in Wimberly.  On Saturday, we will
probably get up and do Caycie's lingere shower around lunch.  Then it may
be fun to look around the town - supposedly there is really cute shopping!

I called a couple of the nail salons in town and the one that I really
liked was NV Nails.  A manicure is $12 and a peticure is $25 - if you get
both, it is $34.  He said that if we call ahead he can get a sign that says
""Bachelorette Party"" and he can reserve a place for us.

This could be something that some of us do and some others can stay at
Ann's house if they did not want to get their nails done.

What do you guys think?

Lisa

   ""Outplacement experts offer these three pieces of advice to holiday job

   with a positive self-image makes a much better impression on potential

       A Weekly Compendium of Feedback on the Words in A.Word.A.Day
         and Other Interesting Tidbits about Words and Languages

--------------------------------

From: Paul Klenck (klenckp@attbi.com)
Subject: Sport theme - Hat trick

This week's theme of words with sports origins fits hand in (baseball)
glove here in Chicago, but today's stock market columnist went a little
overboard. Chicago Tribune writer Bill Barnhart had six phrases with
sport origins in the first few sentences of his column. This included
his describing modest returns on stocks, safety and profits in bonds
and a recovery in the overall economy as ""the hat trick"" for investors.

Barnhart also wrote of ""the tough balancing act""--gymnastics; ""up, up
and away""--hot air ballooning; ""in their pocket""--billiards; ""the tables
have turned""--chess; and ""the dominoes are beginning to line up.""

--------------------------------

From: John Merriam (john.merriam@harveybrockless.co.uk)
Subject: Re: words from sports

Great word, thanks. Did you know that the cricketing word ""duck"" (meaning
zero) relates to the tennis word ""love""? One is short for ""duck egg"" which
looks like a 0 and the other comes from the French ""l'oeuf"".

--------------------------------

From: Robert Tolmach (rtolmach@nyc-expo.com)
Subject: idioms

I once looked at a book of French idioms, and noted that whereas ours
are mostly sports-related, there are invariably about food.

""Je suis tomb? aux pommmes"" (I fell in the apples), for I fainted.

--------------------------------

From: Lawrence Chalmer (chalmerl@ndu.edu)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

Ref your comments today on sports metaphors. I discuss this frequently
in my classes on multinational adaptation / acculturation. E.g. rolled a
perfect 300, batted a ...., threw him out, your work was a line drive,
be the fullback on this issue, and the often used comment from basketball
- you'll miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

--------------------------------

From: Gene Boyd (geneboyd@dsplus.com)
Subject: Not born with the sports gene

I can relate to your comment about not being born with the ""sports gene"".
I stopped at my brother's house one day and noticed that he was watching
football, so I asked: ""Who's playing?""
He looked surprised and said: ""It's the Superbowl!"".
""Oh"", I replied...""Who's playing?""

--------------------------------

From: Siddharth Suri (suri@esuri.com)
Subject: Re:: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

One way to respond to all sports-related questions or comments is to simply
say ""darn defence!"". These two words will make you seem very knowledgeable
about any sport and any game. Except maybe fishing.

--------------------------------

From: Howard Germain (germ@webtv.net)
Subject: real world of sports

You have contrasted the ""real"" world with the world of sports. Alas,
sports are all too real. We have become a nation (if not a world) of
gladiators... one of the leading indicators of a declining civilization!
(see Gibbons.)

--------------------------------
From: Michele Boddewyn (mboddewyn@gaynordesign.com)
Subject: Absence of sports gene

I love your self-description of being born w/o the sports gene. I like your
reply to the supermarket check out question. My reply is usually and the
Yankees are ... basketball?

--------------------------------

From: Jim Jardine (jim@jardine-engineering.com)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

On being sports challenged: When guys (hardly ever a woman) ask, ""So, what
did you think of that game last night?"" My usual reply is, ""What were they
playing?""

--------------------------------

From: Michael Eby (meby@specialdata.com)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket

I loved the comment about the sports talk.

My friend: ""So, yeah... did you see when Trent Dilfer made that awesome
touchdown last night?""
Me: ""Yeah... and then when he ran to second base... that was like, so cool.""
My friend: "" ... ""
My friend: ""Oooookaaay... anyways.""

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--dipsy doodle
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/dipsy_doodle.html

In 1937, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra recorded a tune that became a hit,
""The Dipsy Doodle,"" by Larry Clinton. The melody ""was sort of a
wacky-sounding thing, and it it needed a wacky-sounding title,"" said
Clinton, quoted in George T. Simon's ""The Big Band Songbook"" (1975).
""Then I remembered Carl Hubbell of the Giants and the screwball pitch
he used to throw. They called it the dipsy doodle pitch, so that's
what I called my new tune.""

--------------------------------

From: Byron Douglass (bjdouglass@uhs.com)
Subject: dipsy doodle

Dipsy Doodle was a popular song of years past. Who can remember what
movie it was featured in? I found the words on the internet. Here they are:

The Dipsy Doodle
Tommy Dorsey

The dipsy doodle is the thing to beware
The dipsy doodle will get in your hair
And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
The things you say will come out in reverse
Like ""You love I and me love you!""
That's the way the dipsy doodle works.
You can't eat, you can't sleep. You go crazy.
You're just a victim of the dipsy doodle
And it's not your mind that's hazy
It's your heart that's at fault - not your noodle.
You better listen and try to be good
And try to do all the things that you should
The dipsy doodle will get you some day
And when it gets you the things you will say
Like the moon jumped over the cow - hey diddle!
That's the way the dipsy doodle works.

1. n. A slow, tantalizing curveball.
2. n. Term for any odd-breaking pitch, including a suspected spitball.

Dickson notes about five different spellings and then quotes Edward J.
Nichols: ""The uncertainty as to spelling is typical of terms invented
by the players rather than the sports reporters.""

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--hat trick
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/hat_trick.html

""Hat trick"" as used in ice hockey refers to, where scoring three goals
in a game is a tremendous achievement for a single player, and which
results in the spectators throwing their hats onto the ice with the scorer
skating around picking them up to general acclaim. The game can't continue
until all the hats are taken off the ice, so the more hats the longer the
cheering lasts.

From: Ellison Goodall (brideyrevisited@aol.com)
Subject: playing cricket

What about the euphemism, ""to play cricket"" usually in the negative.
""That's not playing cricket"" - not being fair, with an implication to
unsportsmanlike behavior; I admonish my children with this phrase if
they have done something not completely sportsmanlike or seemingly
unfair, whether or not sports is involved in the matter. Especially odd
since we are definite Americans and while my children have seen cricket
played, they really know very little about the game.

   Good idiom you mention here. Usually it goes as, ""That's not cricket.""

"A.Word.A.Day--odeum","odeum (oh-DEE-uhm) noun, plural odea

   1. A theater or concert hall.

   2. A roofed building in ancient Greece and Rome used for theatrical
      performances.

[From Latin odeum, from Greek oideion, from oide (song).]

Now you know why so many cinema halls are named Odeon. A few other words
that share the same root as odeum are ode, comedy, and tragedy. -Anu

   ""`Dinah Was,' the wonderful Dinah Washington musical about one of soul's
   great divas, has inaugurated an equally wonderful, new Off-Broadway
   theater, the Gramercy on 23rd Street. This 499-seat odeum is a luxurious
   addition to the burgeoning New York theater scene and is perfect for
   this new musical.""
   Liz Smith, Disney's Tobacco Rogue, Newsday (New York), Jul 15, 1998.

"Jan Tasters","Nancy emailed me about a restaurant that I have not heard of called ""The
Daily Review"" - I looked it up on citysearch and it sounds really good!

Here is the reivew:

http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/9857813/

We could either go there this month or we could cook this month (the recipe exchange) and save it for February.  What do you think?

Also, are we still thinking that Monday nights are the best?  They definitely are the best for me, provided that we do not have NCL.  Is everyone free
 on Jan 14, Jan 21?

"Power Outage at Enron Building","
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

The other shoe just dropped!

January is the month of Frequent Flyer offers and program changes. Just
yesterday, I received three MCI, two Sprint and a Nextel promotion in the mail
offering extra miles to join, switch or what have you. I probably will need
them as I also received a press release I had been expecting, ""Northwest
Airlines today announced that it is eliminating blackout dates for WorldPerks
award travel..."" Wow, that's not what it is supposed to say, it is supposed to
say, ""Take advantage of your last chance to book (Northwest) Continental
Airlines Off-Peak Rewards. Beginning June 1, 2002, this reward will no longer
be available."" After all, this is what Continental had said the week before and
what I was expecting from Northwest was to be the same announcement simply
because as partners, Continental and Northwest's programs are mirror images of
each other. What I found disturbing is what each carrier didn't say in their
release. The missing words were left to be said by the other partner. That is,
since the programs mirror each other, shouldn't the releases have been the same
and not parsed in such a manner as to require reading of both releases to get a
truer picture?  For the complete story and what you can do, visit
http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/AR_AirlineNews_Article.cfm?&ArticleID=317

See you on a flight soon,


Bob

"A.Word.A.Day--chautauqua","Chautauqua (shuh-TO-kwuh, chuh-) noun

   An annual summer school offering education in the form of public lectures
   and cultural activities, often held outdoors.

[After Chautauqua, the name of a lake and county in southwestern New York
state where such a program originated in 1874.]

   ""In this Chautauqua I would like not to cut any new channels of
   consciousness but simply dig deeper into old ones that have become
   silted in with the debris of thoughts grown stale and platitudes too
   often repeated.""
   Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, 1974.

No matter where we stand on miles and miles of this earth, they all afford
an equally wondrous view of the stars. Yet the age-old wisdom tells us there
are three important things to look for when the aim is to call a few yards
of this land ours: location, location, location. And location is what we want
to pay attention to when it comes to this week's words for they all came from
the names of some locations. They are known as toponyms, words derived from
places.

Whether it's when we drink champagne (from Champagne, France), make a
solecism (after Soloi, an Athenian colony in Cilicia), or when we meet our
Waterloo (Waterloo, Belgium) we are (perhaps unknowingly) alluding to a
distant land and its history. This week's words take us to New York, Rome,
Ireland, Germany, and the Mediterranean.                            -Anu

"A.Word.A.Day--philomath","philomath (FIL-uh-math) noun

   A lover of learning.

[From Greek philomaths (fond of learning), from philo- (loving) + math-
root of manthanein (to learn).]

Here's a late-blooming version of today's word: opsimath
http://wordsmith.org/words/opsimath.html

   ""Why was the library given this name? ... Tomasz Zan simply appealed to
   them as patron by virtue of having been a philomath and an exile who
   remained faithful to his country.""
   Czeslaw Milosz, From Milosz's ABC's, Partisan Review (Boston), Winter 2001.

During my years as an engineering student at HBTI (Harcourt Butler
Technological Institute, Kanpur, India), I once made a cross-country
trip with my classmates. We were accompanied by one of our most lovable
instructors, Cyril Alexander Furtado, a short, balding fellow, a recent
graduate himself.

As we got together to celebrate new year's eve in Goa, India, someone
asked him to describe his students -- some 18 of us who formed that small
computer science group. His perceptive comments were a delight as he depicted
us as he saw us. His observations brought us many a chuckle and a few of
his words have stayed with me since. As he talked about a quiet, diminutive
fellow among us, he noted: It takes all kinds to make this world, but it's
the good that sustain in the end.

Yes, indeed, it takes all kinds of people, and five words for this week are
a sampling in that spirit.

""Dozes off at the right moment,"" were his words about me - perhaps an apt
reflection of my inability to endure any ""dull"" lectures.            -Anu

"A.Word.A.Day--samizdat","samizdat (SAH-miz-daht) noun

   An underground publishing system to print and circulate banned
   literature clandestinely. Also, such literature.

[From Russian samizdat, from samo- (self) + izdatelstvo (publishing house),
from izdat (to publish). Coined facetiously on the model of Gosizdat (State

"Caycie's Party","Hi guys,

I am so excited about this weekend!  I cannot wait to see all of you!!!

Here are a few reminders about the weekend:

We are all meeting at Ann's house around 7:30 - hopefully we can all get to
the restaurant by 8:00.  We are going to Casa Loma - they do not take
reservations for a party of our size, but around 7:30 I can call and put
our names on the list.  It may be fun to hang out in the bar for awile
anyway.  I think everyone but Emily and Kathryn are going to make it for
dinner on Friday night.  If you are NOT going to make it for dinner, please
let me know as soon as you can - because we don't want to be waiting for
you.

Bring a pillow and blanket if you can.  There are enough beds to sleep 8, I
think.

Please do not forget to bring your own alcohol for the weekend.  Also, we
are going to Salt Lick for dinner on Saturday night - make sure to bring
whatever you want to drink because the restaurant is BYOB.  Also, it is a
CASH ONLY place.  They will have an ATM there, but they will not accept
credit cards or checks.

Also, could each of you bring $10 to chip in for the weekend?  I added up
the costs for the weekend (maid, cake, lunch on Sat) and it totals about
$100 - if we all split it, the cost is only $10/person.

Manicures:  After the lingeree shower, we are going to get our nails done
at a nail place in town.  I have these people that are wanting either a
manicure and/or peticure: Abby, Jeannie, Eddie, Becky, Ann, Susan, Lisa -
if anyone else wants one, please email me so I can let the sweet man know
who is running the shop.

Don't forget your swimsuit too!  I think the weather is going to be
wonderful!

Thank you all for coming!  I know this means so much to Caycie!

Here is my cell if you need anything: 713-851-2068

Love, Lisa

[IMAGE]     Click to learn more...     	[IMAGE]			[IMAGE]	 Click to learn more...      [IMAGE] Happy 2K2 Everyone!     Welcome to another chapter of The Morpheus Minute and to a brand new year. On New Year's Eve, Jupiter was in its closest approach to Earth since 1752. The planet became the second-brightest object in the nighttime sky (after the moon). If any of you caught a glimpse of Jupiter on New Year's Eve, consider yourself lucky -- it won't be in that position again until 2084. So, if you managed to nab some photos or videos of the planet with the Big Red Spot, please ""share"" them!      Eliminate your DEBT for FREE!! This non-profit program can ELIMINATE your interest charges and improve your credit rating ALL FOR FREE!!  Click here     [IMAGE] Ask D.C. Flash!    D.C. Flash is working hard to answer all the questions that pour into the StreamCast Networks' inboxes. In each newsletter, D.C. will attempt to answer 4 or more FAQs. Here are this issue's questions:  1) I accidentally dumped the contents of my c:/ drive into my shared files folder. How do I remove the files from the folder without losing them? Did you dump your whole C drive or just a few unwanted files? The first step is to select and right click on the file you'd like to transfer back. From the menu, select the option, Save As. In the new window that pops up, select the location you'd like to place this file. Hit ok. You're now free to delete the file from your Shared Files folder. Pat yourself on the back, and repeat, if necessary.  2) I have a band and want to put the songs we wrote and recorded on Morpheus. Are there step-by-step instructions on how to do this? To upload content into your shared files folder, simply select the file you want to share, and drop it in. It's that easy! Morpheus is a great place to introduce your original music to the world!  3) Is there a Linux version of Morpheus? Not yet, but we're working on it. We'll keep you posted on roll out dates. And for the hundreds of users that have requested it - a Mac version of Morpheus is the works to be released soon. Watch for updates!  4) It doesn't work, why?  D.C. needs more specific information to help with this one. Since we don't have it, you may first want to try troubleshooting with our FAQ/Help section. Check to see if you have the right hardware requirements. What OS are you running? Make sure that it's Morpheus compatible. Rule out any obvious problems, visit the FAQ, and then visit your favorite search engine to research tech tips. You may also want to consult your PC's OEM web site; there may be necessary updates that you're lacking. If you still can't solve the problem, e-mail DC back and give more detail regarding the problem you are encountering.     Save up to 80% on Inkjet Cartridges at Myinks! Satisfaction Guaranteed.

"Flexible Spending Accounts","Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

"A.Word.A.Day--ultramontane","ultramontane (ul-truh-mon-TAYN) adjective

   1. Of or pertaining to people or region beyond the mountains.

   2. Supporting the Pope's authority over the Roman Catholic Church in all
      countries.

noun

   1. One who lives beyond the mountains.

   2. One who favors papal supremacy.

[From Medieval Latin ultramontanus, from Latin ultra- (beyond) + mont-, mons
(mountain).]

   ""Adopting the sort of tone you use with recalcitrant pets or unruly
   children, the government makes no concessions. This is par for the course
   on reform of the Commons, where chief whip Ann Taylor and ultramontane
   Margaret Beckett, leader of the house, have been veritable forces of
   conservatism.""
   David Walker, Executive Powers: Modernise is Still One of the Government's
   Favourite Words, The Guardian (London), May 29, 2000.

Once in my life I was a Cleveland Indian. I boarded a plane at the New Delhi
airport and landed at my destination, Cleveland, to attend a graduate school
at Case Western Reserve University. Soon after arriving, I discovered the
picturesque vast expanse of Lake Erie to the north of the city and learnt
that we were North Shore residents. Or were we?

Lake Erie separates the city of Cleveland from Canada. Upon visiting Canada
on the other side of the lake I discovered that the folks there also claimed
to be on the North Shore. And I realized they were right, since Cleveland
actually lies on the South Shore of the Lake. Now, try telling that to
countless business owners in Cleveland who have named their enterprises
""North Shore Computers"", North Shore this and North Shore that.

Well, I guess it's all relative. It all depends on what side of the fence
or pond one is on. And the same is true with ultramontane. First it was
applied by the Italians, rather contemptuously, to those living north of
the Alps, such as the French and Germans. Later, the tables were turned
on them, and those on the North began calling Italians ultramontane. Now
it could be anyone living on the other side of a mountain, a foreigner,
or an ultraconservative.

A straightforward looking word, and what a history it packs in those four
little syllables! This week we'll look at a few other terms with Italian
connections, words of various shapes and sizes from the land of pizza
and pasta.                                                        -Anu

"A.Word.A.Day--condottiere","condottiere (kon-duh-TYAR-ee, -ay) noun, plural condottieri

   A hired soldier; mercenary.

[From Italian condottiere, a leader of a group of mercenaries who sold
their services to warring states during 14-16th centuries. From Italian,
from condotta (conduct).]

   ""Plenty of states are willing to supply condotierre for the Saudis.""
   Y. Sadowski, Revolution, Reform, or Regression?, Brookings Review
   (Washington, DC), Winter 90/91.

   ""If any doubts remained about Pakistan's covert support for the
   insurgents, they have now been dispelled: Mere condottieri, dependent
   on their own resources, could not possibly have mounted this
   well-orchestrated military assault.""
   Sumit Ganguly, On the Brink in Kashmir, The Nation (New York),
   Jul 19, 1999.

   The part of the stage that is in front of the curtain.

[From Latin proscenium, from Green proskenion, from pro- (before) +
skene (scene).]

   ""A certain elegant artificiality borders this novel (Gertrude and
   Claudius) like the proscenium of a stage. Updike has laced his own
   Shakespearean aphorisms through the narrative.""

"NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

"A.Word.A.Day--sticky wicket","sticky wicket (STIK-ee WIK-it) noun

   A difficult, awkward or uncertain situation.

[From cricket, when the ground is partly wet, resulting in the ball
bouncing unpredictably.]

   ""British Prime Minister Tony Blair, maneuvering his way through the
   sticky wicket of the Middle East, wanted to stress the need to maintain
   an international coalition.""
   William Safire, Fog of War: Von Clausewitz Strikes Again, The New York
   Times Magazine, Nov 18, 2001.

Somehow I wasn't born with the sports gene. Sure, I've played an innings
or two of cricket but that's about it. Since I'm never one to listen to
running commentaries on radio or watch live telecasts on TV, my exchange
with other sports enthusiasts typically goes like this:

Person in the checkout line: So what do you think of last night's
game between the Yankees and the Flying Ducks?
I: Yes.

Well, this sports-challenged temperament doesn't have to stop one from
using the words of sports. There are countless terms from the world of
sports we use metaphorically every day, whether it's when we exhort
someone to ""be a sport"" or when we chatter about the economy, saying
that it's not dead ""by a long shot"".

This week's AWAD brings together a few words from the world of cricket,
football, baseball, and other games and sports, that are used in real
life as well.                                                     -Anu

It's been two years and American is still the only airline to have expanded the amount of legroom throughout the coach cabin on its aircraft. American and TWA have removed a total of 8,730 coach seats on 900 jet aircraft offering more room and more comfort for our customers.

Customers traveling on international flights should arrive at the airport at least two hours before departure. You will need to have your government-issued photo ID available at all times, as well as a printed itinerary if you are using an electronic ticket.  And remember to be onboard the aircraft and in your assigned seat at least 10 minutes before scheduled departure time.

"Happy New Year","



I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or play outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Deer Valley. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny...he tipped me .50 on 2.50..ha.  The town is loaded with intense
looking film types with their dark rimmed glasses...north face down jackets,
cell phones and ski caps...its pretty funny.  This morning I went for a jog
around down town....I walked down Main st. on my way back and there are all
these people getting photographed along the street...you look at them and
try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like any other guy.
The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out their stories and
photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in this cafe and all are
being used right now..it is crazy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

""Oh, East is East and West is West, and the wrong one I have chose?""

Is it possible to make a mistake on foreign travel right now?  Only if you pay
too much!  Here are some ways to save and get you on your way to Asia or Europe
for a song!  See?  There is a tie in.

The first place to look for super travel deals is right on top of the OneTravel
home page in Spotlight Sales.  Here you will find negotiated fares that are
truly unbeatable in their overall value.  The next spot is this newsletter
which contains last minute and weekend specials, again tailored to your
individual location.  Finally, I spend the week turning stones to find deals
that are not generally available to the traveling public and bring them to you.
 Here are those picks this week.

Cathay Pacific and Icelandair have something very unique in common...they both
are based and have their hubs on fairly small islands.  The other thing they
have in common is their commitment to service and fares so good, you can't
afford to stay home!  Cathay is offering their deal of the month that allows
you to travel from New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco to Hong Kong AND
Singapore for $599 plus the usual taxes and fees amounting to another $100 or
so.  The travel window for the deal is May 1 through June 30, 2002, a great
time to visit both these cities.  Full details can be found at
http://www.cathay-usa.com/dotm/dotm.asp

Icelandair offers weekly ""Lucky Fares"" for travel from several Eastern cities,
and one Midwest city, to Europe.  The sale that ended Tuesday offered Boston or
Baltimore to Paris with a midweek departure and return for $248 plus taxes and
fees.  If Europe is in your plans and you can travel at the last minute, these
may be the sales to watch.  Visit http://www.icelandair.com

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

"A.Word.A.Day--throttlebottom","Throttlebottom (THROT-l-bot-uhm) noun

   A purposeless incompetent in public office.

[After Alexander Throttlebottom, a Vice Presidential character in
Of Thee I Sing, a 1932 musical comedy.]

In honor of President's Day, this week we've been looking at words with
presidential connections. It's about time we paid our dues to the Vice
President too. A VP, by very nature, is meant to play a second fiddle
though it's not uncommon to find an eminence grise in that office. Here's
how the term throttlebottom came to represent VPs and other similar (mostly)
harmless figures:

The first musical comedy to win the Pulitzer Prize, ""Of Thee I Sing"" is a
brilliant political satire that gave us today's word. In this masterful
operetta (music: George Gershwin, lyrics: Ira Gershwin, libretto: George
Kaufman and Morris Ryskind), presidential candidate John P. Wintergreen
runs a political campaign based on the theme of love. His National Party
sponsors a beauty contest, with Wintergreen to marry the winner. Instead,
Wintergreen falls in love with Mary Turner, a secretary at the pageant, and
marries her on the day of his inauguration. Diana Devereaux, the contest
winner, sues President Wintergreen for breach of contract; France threatens
to go to war, since Devereaux is of French descent; and Congress impeaches
him. Wintergreen points out the United States Constitution provision that
when the President is unable to perform his duty, the Vice President fulfills
the obligations. VP Throttlebottom agrees to marry Diana and forever etches
his name in the dictionaries.                                        -Anu

   ""Every Vice President from John Nance Garner to at least Lyndon Johnson
   went into the office vowing: `I will not be a Throttlebottom.'""
   J. Roberts, Throttlebottoms's Legacy, National Review (New York),
   Jun 25, 1990.

This week's theme: words with presidential connections.

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON THREE - Flexibility

Time...what a concept!  Truly the one thing we have no control over!  It can be ""on your side,"" or ""your timing couldn't be worse.""  Flexibility is very important in ensuring you obtain the best value possible in your travels.  While many view planning and flexibility as mutually exclusive terms, planning is very important in maximizing savings while the flexibility aspect ensures readiness to take advantage of an offer when it appears.  More on planning next week.

Not only is flexibility important for finding value, it is also important for your travel mental health.  Delays are quite common for fights, rail, cruises and in the lines formed for security checks and rental cars.  As leisure travelers, we have the ability to ""build in time"" for the unexpected.  This inherent flexibility goes a long way in allowing a modicum of sanity!

Flexibility even lends itself to destinations.  Let's say you are traveling from New York to Disneyland in California.  You get to the airport and find out that your flight has been canceled and the remaining flights into Los Angeles International are full for the rest of the day.  Now, understand that many times counter agents are harried during such times and may additionally be geographically challenged.  The agent may not suggest going into Santa Ana, and even you might not think of it but clearly, SNA is an excellent alternative airport to LAX when traveling to the area.  Truth is there are three others to pick from as well.  So, be flexible in destination airports. A two-hour drive can save you a day's wait for a flight.

Flexibility can mean perks like free tickets and travel vouchers.  Unless I am traveling in conjunction with an air/hotel package, I make it a point to take advantage of over filled flights.  To do this, I will book myself on an earlier flight in the day, or even travel the evening before.  I check in advance to see how full the flight is and whether or not it makes sense to volunteer for a later flight.  Over the years, this flexibility has earned my family of four well over $10,000 in vouchers.  It is important to remember that we are not typical leisure travelers since we fly between 150,000 and 250,000 miles per year.  The thing is that volunteering can be profitable.

Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers' Corner, http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL chapter titled, ""Denied Boarding - If You Have The Time, Here is What To Do.""

See you on a flight soon,



Bob

Play golf where the sun never sets
Visit snow glaciers in the summer's day
Go white water river rafting
Witness huge humpback, blue, killer, and sperm whales
Experience the incredible nightlife of the capital city of Reykjavik
Rejuvenate in the famous Blue Lagoon

The golfing will be competitive but fun and in addition to the two tournament rounds, a practice round precedes each.  Tee times to begin each night at approximately 9:00pm.  The trip includes:
Airfare to/from Reykjavik, Iceland from/to BOS, JFK & BWI via Icelandair.
Visit to the Blue Lagoon

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

"A.Word.A.Day--ethology","ethology (ee-THOL-uh-jee) noun

   The study of animal behavior in their natural environments.

[From French ?thologie, coined by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, zoologist
(1805-1861).]

   ""Field biologists such as Poole and Goodall, who've each spent decades
   studying the behavior of animals in their natural habitats, do not doubt
   that elephants, chimpanzees and other creatures feel intense, humanlike
   emotions - from happiness, sadness and anger to perhaps even love and
   embarrassment... Research by (Marc) Bekoff and others - in fields
   ranging from ethology to neurobiology - is beginning to provide
   scientific support for the notion that animals feel a wide range of
   emotions.""

   A hypocritical person.

[After Uria Heep, a character in Charles Dickens' David Copperfield.]

You can read David Copperfield online at:
http://www.online-literature.com/dickens/copperfield/

   ""This affair shows the accounting profession all too often to be in bed
   with the oldest profession. Accounting standards have been frequently
   prostituted by the new Uriah Heeps: these are executives in ever-merging
   firms afraid to challenge their clients' phony numbers and secret
   self-dealing because they might lose fees in the lucrative consulting
   business they run on the side.""
   William Safire, Where's Scandal in Enron? The New York Times,
   Jan 14, 2002.

There are thousands and thousands of them. In medicine, botany, chemistry,
athletics, and other walks (and runs) of life. We use them all the time
without even realizing it. They come with a whole story about themselves.
They are words derived from people, real and fictional, from history and
from mythology. They are known as eponyms and this week's we'll meet five
of these people and the words they gave us after their names.       -Anu

   1. An organizer, promoter, or manager of public entertainments, such as
      a ballet, opera, concert, or theater company.

   2. Any manager or director.

[From Italian impresario (one who undertakes a business), from impresa
(undertaking), from imprendere (to undertake).]

   ""Even on Broadway, few stars have crashed as spectacularly as Garth
   Drabinsky, the impresario behind Ragtime, theatreland's highest-grossing
   show.""
   From Riches to Ragtime, The Economist (London), Aug 15, 1998.

""All the world's a stage, / And the men and women merely players: / They
have their exits and their entrances; / And one man in his time plays
many parts."" So wrote our friend Bill Shakespeare some 400 years ago in
one of his most profound observations on human condition. Yet, we often
treat this life as if we really are the people we're playing. Imagine how
few troubles we might have if we remember it's only a role we are playing.
All we need to do is to play it as best we can and then gracefully exit
the stage.                                                         -Anu

"A.Word.A.Day--hat trick","hat trick (hat trik) noun

   Three consecutive successes in a game or another endeavor. For example,
   taking three wickets with three successive pitches by a bowler in a
   game of cricket, three goals or points won by a player in a game of
   soccer or ice hockey, etc.

[From cricket, from the former practice of awarding a hat to a bowler who
dismissed three batsmen with three successive balls.]

   ""Can real estate investment trusts (REITs) pull off a hat trick?
   They delivered an impressive total return of 29% in 2000 and a solid
   11.5% in 2001, a period when the stock market was in a dive and the
   economy was sliding into a recession. Sure, vacancy rates are up and
   rents down, but REIT investors believe they will make money again
   in 2002.""

   (New York), December 31, 2001.

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month

Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

        A Compendium of Feedback on the Words in A.Word.A.Day
       and Other Interesting Tidbits about Words and Languages


--------------------------------

From: Anu Garg (anu@wordsmith.org)
Subject: AWADnews

Latest issue of AWADnews is now available. It includes list demographics,
stats (shortest, longest email addresses, etc.), newest countries on the
list, and other regular features: http://wordsmith.org/awad/awadnews.html

--------------------------------

From: Rebecca Ewing (rebecca_ewing@atlmug.org)
Subject: blue rinse

There's a good reason for blue rinse. As we age, a yellow film develops
over the eye, making colors look dull and muted. This is why the
stereotypical old opera goer will wear bright red rouge and lipstick and a
loud dress. To her eye, the red makeup looks pink.

White or gray hair will look brassy to her eye. With a blue rinse, the
hair looks silver or white instead.

One older client phoned me after cataract surgery. She'd always thought
her appliances were almond, when, in fact, they were white.

--------------------------------

From: Jane Ross (janevwross@hotmail.com)
Subject: Bluenose

In Canada, the word ""bluenose"" has a very positive meaning. Our
internationally acclaimed ""Bluenose"" is the clipper ship that adorns our
10 cent piece (our dime). She was an international racing ship -and she won
every race she sailed. She hails from Halifax and consequently those who
live in Halifax are called ""Bluenosers"" (aside from being called
""Haligonians"").

--------------------------------

From: Sherilyn Lee (sherbear@ix.netcom.com)
Subject: Regarding ""Blue Rinse""

While flying to Ireland this summer, I sat next to a man from Cork. I asked
him for some suggestions of places to visit and we struck up a conversation.
Upon my mentioning some well-known Irish tourist attraction, his eyes
sparkled as he said, ""You don't want to go there, it's been washed with the
Blue Rinse. You want something authentic.""

With your clever samples demonstrating the various meaning in words and
phrases using the color blue, you suggest: ""Even a computer would go crazy
trying to make sense of this."" I found this especially amusing, being a
computer geek by trade. Ever since the early days of Windows, when the
operating system crashes (""goes crazy trying to make sense of things""?), it
displays only a simple text error message in white lettering on a blue
background. This condition is almost always ""fatal"", meaning that the
system must be restarted. When this occurs, we say that the system
""bluescreened"", or displayed the Blue Screen Of Death (or BSOD). The term
is so prevalent in the industry that Microsoft's Knowledge Base uses
""bluescreen"" as a common search keyword.

Subject: Re: blue rinse

In American English these folks are generally known as ""blue hairs."" The
theatre community uses the phrase to denote the type of audience typically
found at matinee performances; ""How will that scene play with the blue
hairs?"" is a common query.

Meanwhile, among those who wait tables, ""the blue hairs"" are -- rightly or
wrongly -- thought to be the worst tippers. No one wants to take a table of
blue hairs. Speaking of the waiting profession, in the late '80's, we came
to be gender-non-specifically called ""waitrons,"" which was phased out in
favor of the current ""servers.""

Subject: A.Word.A.Day--blue rinse

Perhaps, it's just the circle I run in, but I've always used the phrase
""blue hairs"", to speak of elderly women. Not all elderly women, but the
type that drive at slow speeds, with one blinker flashing and need a booster
seat to see past the steering wheel, or those that count out pennies at the
cashier when there's a huge line up behind them. The groovier one's are Old
Girls. I hope to be an Old Girl myself one day.

Subject: headline

PS Reading through the AWAD bulletin reminds me of a headline from the
Eastern Daily Press, a wonderfully laconic newspaper which serves East
Anglia, a mainly rural area, whose villages have quaint names deriving from
very early English. (A lot of these village-names end in '-ing', an
interesting area of discussion for AngloSaxon historians and place-name
experts). The headline was in the Recent Weddings section: ""Little Snoring
Man Marries Seething Woman"".

Subject: What's the opposite?

This morning at breakfast while watching Good Morning America my husband
noticed that Dr. Tim Johnson was pronouncing antibiotic ""antibotic"" dropping
a syllable. We learned from AWAD that an epenthesis is when a person adds a
syllable to a word. My husband would like to know what is the word for when
a person drops a syllable?

   The word is haplology. A good example is ""aluminium"" which in the US
   is known as ""aluminum"". It all depends which side of the pond one
   happened to be on: Britons accuse Americans of haplology while the
   latter believe it is the former who are committing epenthesis. I'm
   partial to aluminium -- it conforms to others, such as potassium,
   and magnesium.                                              -Anu

Subject: Blue rinse definition

You have spelled ""gray"" with an ""e."" Gray is American usage; grey is British
usage. Since you use ""color"" instead of ""colour"" in the same entry I am
assuming that these entries are supposed to reflect current and correct
American usage. Just thought you might want to know.

   Yes, my roots are showing. I was born and raised in India, spelling
   words as colour, aluminium, etc. After moving to the US, my spelling
   has undergone change but the traces remain. I still have a bias for
   ""learnt"" instead of ""learned"", for example. While we are on this topic,
   I understand the effect of US English is spreading even on people who
   don't live in the US. According to a report, more British children
   spell color rather than colour now. How are things in other countries?
   Drop us a line.                                             -Anu

Subject: Glad we're not a black and white world

Blue may be a wishy washy color in our language but black and white are not.
In our subtly racist mother tongue, nearly every thing associated with white
is ""good"" while, to an even greater degree, nearly everything associated
with black is bad (Black hat, blackhearted, blackball, blackmail, black cat
crossing our paths, etc.). I wish black and white were as confusing as blue.

--------------------------------

From: LJ (ljbts@securenym.net)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--brown study

Certainly every language has its own way of using concrete colors to express
abstract concepts. No less so Mandarin Chinese.

To refer to something as the 'Blue Root' means it's the original work, or
the source on which other works are based. You can informally refer to a
young lady as a 'Yellow Flower Girl,' identifying her as a maiden or a
virgin. But if the book you're reading or the movie you're watching is
'Yellow,' then that means it's obscene, even pornographic. A fellow's wife
might enjoy thinking back over the 'Pink Memories' of their courtship days
(i.e., romantic memories), but if on the other hand he's 'Wearing a Green
Hat,' then that means she's been very seriously cheating on him. A 'Black
Man' is an unregistered resident, and if the local officials are taking in
'Gray Income,' then they've been accepting money under the table.

No doubt the color red is paramount to the Chinese, in both ancient and
modern history. The last generation sang of their great leader, 'The sun is
crimson red, and Chairman Mao is most beloved'; and to be 'Red-Hearted' was
to be fully devoted to the revolution. Red also from ancient times has
denoted, among other things, honor and favor, such as when you give an
esteemed older friend or teacher a red envelope for Chinese New Year, which
contains gift money. In a similar way, if a boss gives a favored employee
'the Red Envelope,' then that person is getting a special bonus, and may
even be called 'Red Man' by his co-workers, indicating the preferential
treatment he's receiving. And if your name shows up on the 'Red Board,' that
means you made the honor roll.

But beware of a disgruntled acquaintance telling you that he's ""going to
give you some color to look at."" That's the Chinese way of saying, ""I'm
going to teach you a thing or two!""

From: Maria Victoria Go (maria_victoria.go@roche.com)
Subject: Re ""blue rinse""

This colorful metaphor to refer to a specific group of people reminded me
of a local/regional (Philippines) phrase circa late 1950's - 1970's.

The phrase is ""blue seal"": referring in general to an American or anything
made in or imported from the USA. Also used to refer to contraband/smuggled
merchandise (from the US bases - Subic & Clark). The origin of the phrase
is the ""blue"" band/seal on cigarette packs from the United States. People
used the actual phrase ""blue seal"" even when they were speaking in any of
the dialects/languages, not just in English. It was commonly used in an
admiring sense, infrequently as a derogatory term.

--------------------------------

From: Doug Greenwood (doug@mitre.org)
Subject: Brown Study

I was delighted to see ""brown study"" show up yesterday as the word
of the day, which immediately triggered thoughts of my first encounter
with the term, in grad school at Chapel Hill in Louis D. Rubin's course
on Literature of the South. The term's so central to John Crowe Ransom's
""Bells for John Whiteside's Daughter"" that I've never forgotten it--or
the poem--which begins:

	There was such speed in her little body,
	And lightness in her footfall,
	It is no wonder her brown study
	Astonishes us all.

""Brown study"" appears again in the last stanza:

	But now go the bells, and we are ready,
	In one house we are sternly stopped
	To say we are vexed at her brown study,
	Lying so primly propped.

As the father, now, long after finishing my Ph.D. in American
literature, of a ten-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son, I can
tell you that I have played with them on many occasions, and watched
them run and yell and jump in the backyard on many more, and have been
thrust back--sternly--more than once into the innate poignancy of that poem.

One of my favorite headlines -- A travel agency was being sued for failing
to deliver on advertised features of a group junket to Ireland: ""Tour
Allure a Lie"". Of the _un_intentional kind, in teaching Japanese
businessmen how to decode English headlines, my all-time fave is ""British
Left Waffles on Falklands Islands"". I always picture British soldiers
carefully laying down lines of crisp waffles step by step as they walk
backwards toward troopships in the harbor! (Of course here ""left"" is a noun
and ""waffles"" is the verb.)

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON TWO - Timing

Without a doubt, the simplest way to save on travel is through timing. Virtually all destinations worldwide have high or peak, low and possibly ""shoulder"" seasons.  Timing is important for airfares, cruises, hotel stays, rental cars and rail passes.  Even when you take your meals can mean a difference in price as many hotels and other restaurants offer ""early bird"" specials.

Airlines will save you money when you travel on specific days during the week. Many carriers have reduced fares, even in the same fare basis, Tuesday through Thursday and all day Saturday. The famous, ""Saturday night stay required,"" is also a clue to savings. Even time of day can be an important factor, as many fares will state that travel after noon on Monday or before 8 AM on Friday gives a lower fare. The airlines know when their planes are full and when they need to be filled and they price accordingly. Airline seats prices are not like fine wine, they do not get better with age, so be sure to understand advance purchase requirements. Many carriers control their seats so closely, with computers programmed to recognize such things as ""no show rate"" and historical loading, that they can add or remove a fare basis for those seats minute by minute. So as mentioned before, follow up to ensure you are getting the best price.

Hotels also tend to price by day of the week.  A weekend stay at a business hotel like a Marriott in downtown Dallas will be substantially less costly than the same room mid week.  On the other hand, you will find rates at properties that cater to tourists to be higher on the weekend than midweek.  The rule of thumb here is if occupancy is lower, so will be prices as supply far outweighs demand.

Cruisers can save one half or more if they are willing to sail at the last minute, OR book well in advance.  Rental cars go for much less on the weekend, generally Thursday afternoon until Monday noon.  Finally, over the past few years, rail passes have been cheaper in the off season as well.

In addition to the savings you can enjoy with off peak travel, you will also find fewer tourists and more travelers such as yourself.

Your reading assignment for this lesson can be found in the Smart Travelers' Corner, http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Menu.cfm?&Token=NULL chapters titled, ""Timing is Everything,"" and under the Hotels section, read, ""How To Get The Best Prices At The Best Properties.""

See you on a flight soon,


Bob

"A.Word.A.Day--pax romana","Pax Romana (PAKS ro-MAH-nuh) noun

   1. A peace imposed by a powerful state on a weaker or vanquished state.

   2. An uneasy peace.

[From Latin, literally Roman peace. After the state of peace during the life
of the Roman Empire.]

The idea of pax romana is vividly illustrated in ""The Life of Gnaeus Julius
Agricola"" by Roman historian Publius Cornelius Tacitus (translated by Alfred
John Church and William Jackson Brodribb) when Galgacusk, a British leader,
says,
   ""To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire; they
   make a solitude and call it peace.""
-Anu

   ""In his book on globalism, `The Lexus and the Olive Tree,' Thomas L.
   Friedman argues that no two countries with McDonald's franchises have
   ever gone to war. The price of this supersized Pax Romana is, well,
   a McDonald's in every country.""
   Rick Marin, The Least Likely Burning Man, The New York Times,
   Sep 10, 2000.

Hi Larry,

Just wanted to see how you're doing these days.  I'm glad to hear things are finally up and running and that you all have stuff to do now.  I'm with the rest of the lepers down on the fourth floor these days.  We'll have to round up a group to grab a drink after work sometime.

Susan

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Here is our list of February Fantastics!

AIRLINES

While the never-ending sales continue, here is an offer a bit out of the
ordinary.  From Icelandair, we have an ""Eat, Drink and be Merry in Iceland""
promotion.  The festival, which runs from February 27, through March 4,
includes gourmet dining, a National Beer Day, Mystery Basket Food, and Fun
Cooking Competition.  Packages are priced from $579, per person/double
occupancy, plus taxes and fees, and include round-trip airfare, three night's
hotel, transfers, and breakfast (except day of arrival).  You also receive
admission to a kick-off party, gourmet dinner at participating restaurants,
admission to the mystery basket cook-off, admission to the Gala Dinner on March
3, and transportation to some venues.  Extra nights and add-on tours are
available.  Call 800-779-2899 for details.

Delta has jumped on the discount award bandwagon.  For 20,000 miles, you can
fly anywhere in the continental U.S. in coach or for 15,000 more, find out what
really goes on between the curtains and cockpit door!  Travel must be completed
by March 20, 2002.  Visit
http://www.delta.com/skymiles/member_guide/delta_awards/promo_awd/index.jsp.
Remember too that with Delta, there is no Saturday night stay requirement.

HOTELS

Borrowing a page from the airlines, ""pay with cash and miles"" book, Starwood is
offering a rate that combines points and cash for rooms.  The offer is good at
virtually all properties in the system and depending on the hotel category,
award nights can be purchased with a combination of either 2,800 Starpoints and
$45 USD per night or 4,000 Starpoints and $60 USD per night. Participating
hotels outside the U.S. feature the same Starpoint values combined with the
local currency equivalent of either $45 USD or $60 USD at time of reservation.
For details, visit:
http://www.starwood.com/preferredguest/starpoints/cash_points_landing.html

OTHERS

Two weeks ago, I mentioned ways to save in the cities you visit.  The way that
visitor and convention bureaus are working with local restaurants and hotels
has been punctuated by New York's ""Paint the Town Red, White and Blue""
promotion.  Here you will find three course lunches for $20 or less and full
course dinners for about $30.  You will also find ways to save on Broadway
shows and transportation.  Wow, what a deal!  Visit http://www.nycvisit.com for
complete details and your discount card to be used with your AmEx card.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

"A.Word.A.Day--esemplastic","esemplastic (es-em-PLAS-tik) adjective

   Having the capability of moulding diverse ideas or things into unity.

[From Greek es- (into) + en, neuter of eis (one) + plastic. Coined by poet
Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834), apparently after German Ineinsbildung
(forming into one)].

Here is how Coleridge used the term in his 1817 Biographia Literaria or
Biographical Sketches of My Literary Life and Opinions. Vol. I, Chapter 13:

On the imagination, or esemplastic power.
O Adam! one Almighty is, from whom
All things proceed, and up to him return
If not depraved from good: created all
Such to perfection, one first nature all
Indued with various forms, various degrees.

   ""Admirers of (A.N.) Wilson, and I have been one of them, may console
   themselves by speculating that he just got impatient, or tired. Or that
   a minor demon, in a snit over his prolific output and ambitious subject
   matter, cast a temporary malediction on his esemplastic powers of
   fiction-making.""
   Gail Godwin, Losing It All, The Washington Post, Jan 23, 1994.

Like a house of cards, Enron corporation came down a few weeks ago. Its
bankruptcy proceedings opened what may turn out to be a Pandora's box for
more than just the corporation itself. Journalists are using the freshly
minted term Enronomics to describe this corporation's brand of economics
and accounting: off-the-record dealings, cooking books, and number sorcery
that led to its rise and crash. Creative accounting has been going on for
ages but it seems that Enron perfected it.

Whether the term enronomics sticks, only time will tell. But this is a good
example of how new words are coined. Some weather the test of time and get
anointed into the venerated pages of dictionaries, while others fade like
last year's fashion.

This week's AWAD features five words, all coined by people, that have stuck
around. Those who brought these expressions to life are a diverse lot. We'll
see inventions of a poet, a cartoonist, a zoologist, and two journalists
during the next five days.                                          -Anu

MR. MAXIMILER: Our column from ~OneTravel.com's~ own Frugalist, Bob Jones,
features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

Savings can be found on the other end of the rainbow!

Since there hasn't been too much change in the airfare and hotel sales, I
thought we could concentrate on saving at your destination.  There are
certainly some amazing airfares and hotels offers but let's face it, you don't
travel to New York, Chicago or San Francisco just to sit in your room and
vegetate.  So today, let's look at some ways to save money and do the things
you want to do when you get to your destination.

Every major city has some sort of visitor's bureau.  On those pages, you can
find special offers that frankly, are not advertised anywhere but there and in
the visitor's centers themselves.  Right now, every major tourist destination
from Las Vegas to Boston is hurting for tourists and the visitor's and
convention bureaus are doing all they can to get you to their city.  They have
negotiated special deals with museums and transportation authorities.  Often,
they will offer a coupon booklet for discounts at restaurants and
entertainment.  You can even find buy one get one free offers to further
stretch your travel dollar.

Be sure to carry your AAA card, or other association cards, with you for
discounts and remember to check the special offers from the various credit card
companies.  All five major issuers have listings on their sites for special
travel and destination deals.  The only secret here is to go to the sites and
look for these deals.  As an example,
http://www.visadestinations.com/USA/visadestinations/USAViewDest.asp?DEST_ID=201
 will give you Visa's offers for San Francisco, all 13 of them.  For the other
companies, visit
http://www.onetravel.com/advisor/ST_Detail.cfm?&CatID=4&edit_id=30&SubCatID=409


Finally, City Pass at http://www.citypass.com is a singular source of savings
in Boston, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Hollywood/Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Philadelphia.

So, once you have found that super vacation deal on
http://www.11thhourvacations.com or are just planning to stay in your local
area with a super hotel deal from http://www.hotelwiz.com remember these tips
to extend your travel dollar!

See you on a flight soon,


Bob

features up-to the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles and save
you travel cash.  Read on for this week's ""Mr. Maximiler"" tip!

The Sale that would not die!

Each week I tell myself that the airfare sales will end...but they just don't.
It's kind of like watching a ""Halloween"" movie; Jason will pop out!  The
strangest part of these sales now is that most are unadvertised.

There once was a time when an airline would ""float"" a fare to see if other
carriers would match it and if others did not, the price would be pulled in a
few minutes.  (Note:  Airlines have staff assigned whose only job is to watch
pricing at other airlines.)  Times have changed in this regard as carriers are
going their own way in spite of some joint marketing outlets which sell excess
or distressed inventory.  Their own ""yield management"" computers are making
decisions and probably suggesting sales and promotions.  Again, many times
these ""sales"" are transparent to the consumer as they are not truly advertised
and people just stumble on them...like yesterday.

My wife has to take a Government business trip to Kansas City in April.  I had
booked her ticket for a not unreasonable price of $225.  Early the next day,
she called me to tell me she would have to stay an extra day.  Since the
reservation was less than 24 hours old, a change or cancellation would be easy.
 When I looked at the fare online, it had dropped some $61 and the trip she was
taking the following week had dropped $50. Talk about found money!  I
immediately called the airline, changed the one reservation and requested an
MCO (a voucher for future travel) for the fare difference.  The one
reservation, less than 24 hours old, was simply reissued and the difference in
price was credited back to my credit card.

In the past, I have made it a point to check prices on reservations I hold
every Friday morning. This is largely due to sales that hit the streets
overnight on Thursday.  But the point here, and one to be well taken, is simply
this - Had I not changed the reservation the following day, the envelope I keep 
vouchers in would be $111 shorter.  Moral of the story?  Check your
reservations at least once a day.

And the sales?  Well, most are extended for travel through August 21st on
domestic flights.  The international trips are less predictable but the best
over all bargains can be found in the Spotlight Sales at:

See you on a flight soon,

Bob

Subject: Uriah Heep

Re: March 18's word of the day: Uriah Heep is also the name of a fairly
bad 1970s British rock band that still makes the rounds, albeit with only
the lead guitar player surviving from the original lineup.

--------------------------------

From: Lorrie (lorriedeck@msn.com)
Subject: Uriah Heep

I follow the American tradition of naming my cars. Several years ago, I
bought a Jeep Cherokee. It was the first vehicle I gave a masculine name.
I named it Uriah Jeep. Obviously, I thought that was humorous. What was
not so funny was how often I had to explain to others who Uriah Heep was.
And even more pathetic was that most people, while not familiar with the
Dickens character, were familiar with a rock band from the 70's with the
same name.

--------------------------------

From: Mike Masin (nemesis258@mchsi.com)
Subject: Re: Uriah Heep

I still hold a rather vivid picture, in my mind, of Uriah Heep, from my
first reading of David Copperfield some fifty years ago. I feel that the
words unctuous and shifty would be better measures of him than hypocritical.

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--circe

Circe is indeed the goddess who lured sailors to her island and then
turned them into swine. However, she did finally relent and give them
directions to get home. No doubt this was the genesis of men being afraid
to stop for directions.

I know a number of women (I count myself one of them) who I refer to as

into men!

Surely the great age of the original Methuselah was never more memorably
invoked than by Ira Gershwin in the song ""It Ain't Necessarily So"":

Methuselah lived nine hundred years
Methuselah lived nine hundred years
But who calls that livin'
When no gal will give in
To no man what's nine hundred years

--------------------------------

From: Stewart Gordon (smjg@iname.com)
Subject: RE: A.Word.A.Day--methuselah

You also get methuselahs in John Conway's so-called Game of Life. It's a
pattern of just a few cells that grows and then stabilises after many
generations. Some outstanding examples are known as the ""r-pentomino"",
""acorn"" and ""bunnies"".

From: Rob Gordon (rgordon@mec.ca)
Subject: Re: Mogul

I love AWAD, and am always impressed by both your creativity in selecting
words and your thoroughness in defining them. So I was surprised that in your
definition of 'mogul' you did not mention one of the word's most common
colloquial uses: to skiers, moguls are the bumps in a downhill run created
by the continuous 'S' pattern of linked turns that are made in the snow.
As a hill becomes skied-in by many skiers, the S-shapes become deep ruts,
and the mounds of snow between the ruts become moguls. More skilled and
daring skiers then have fun by skiing OVER the bumps, or moguls. ""Moguls""
is now a sanctioned discipline and an official medal sport in the winter
Olympics.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Chautauqua has been one of my favorite words since I was very little.
I was born in Chautauqua County, New York. My grandfather thought that
""Chautauqua"" had a rhythm to it (chAU -- tAU -- qUA ). He taught me to
spell it when I was two years old. The original Indian word means bag
tied in the middle. Lake Chautauqua rather looks like a bag tied in the
middle.

This quote is actually a play on the lyrics of the song _Our Love is Here to

from http://www.jazzalbum.com/Resource/Word/ourlovehere.htm

In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble

Another trivia note about Gibraltar from the Internet Movie Database

Subject: Norman Einstein

Quotation from AWAD, Feb 8, 2002:
> Nobody in the game of football should be called a genius. A genius is
> somebody like Norman Einstein. -Joe Theismann, Former quarterback

This quote which is rightly attributed to Joe Theismann has an even more
humorous explanation.

It turns out that Theismann went to high school with Norman Einstein and he
was the class valedictorian. This was verified by Sports Illustrated some
years back which ran Einstein's yearbook picture with the story.

So, when Theismann says, ""He's no Norman Einstein"", he means the same thing
as we do when we say, ""He's no Albert Einstein.""
How are we to know this?

Well, apparently Joe Theismann is no Norman Einstein.

--------------------------------

From: Roland Moss (t-ro@lycos.com)
Subject: ""till""
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/kilkenny_cats.html

I enjoy Word-A-day. Am I old-fashioned? Has ""till"" become acceptable as a
shortened ""until""? It rubs against my schooling in England. (See ""Killkenny
Cats"").

   ""Till"" is not a shortened form of ""until"". In fact, ""until"" is
   an expanded form of ""till"". ""Till"" is the older of the two and
   ""until"" was formed by adding the prefix un- to it. They are
   synonymous and mostly interchangeable. Here's a quick reference
   on acceptability of various forms:

   till  : OK
   until : OK
   'till : Not OK
   'til  : Maybe OK (only in informal writing)

   Well, schoolteachers are only human. To see more instances
   where what you learnt in school isn't always right, see the
   discussion of ""dilemna"" in AWADmail 39:

Thanks for highlighting this word in your 'Facts and Arguments' feature
in today's Globe and Mail.

One of the more amusing mondegreens of which I'm aware relates to the
title of Malachy McCourt's autobiography. Malachy is the brother of
Frank McCourt and features prominently in McCourt's autobiography
'Angela's Ashes'.

Malachy entitled his book, 'A Monk Swimming'. In the book he explains
the origin of the phrase as being his mis-hearing the 'Hail Mary' when a
young lad; the relevant phrase being, ""blessed are you amongst women.""

climb a route but hang on the rope a lot instead of climbing it ""clean,""
then you're accused of hangdogging the route. Climbing is now full of very
interesting words that describe the exact combination of moves a climber
does to attain the top of a route.

I've sent the great gift of wordsmith to all my friends and we talk
about the daily word up at the cliffs. Think of it as higher education.

Subject: Regarding the word ethology
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/ethology.html

I forwarded today's word to a list of historians of psychology, who
all want you to know that there was an earlier, 19th century version
of ethology:

   In his 1843 SYSTEM OF LOGIC, J.S. Mill proposed the  development of a
   new science he also called ""ethology,"" whose purpose would be the
   explanation of individual and national differences in character, on the
   basis of associationistic psychology.  Needless to say, the French sense
   of the term has prevailed.

Your commentary relating to 'ultramontane' include a reminiscence of your
days in Cleveland, which you remember as being located on the ""North Shore.""
While there might be some Clevelanders who mistakenly use this phrase, the
much more common Cleveland expression is that we live on the ""North Coast,""
which is accurate, even from the point of view of our Canadian neighbors.
A brief check of the Cleveland White Pages shows 23 entries for ""North Shore
etc."" businesses, but roughly five times that number of entries for ""North
Coast etc."" businesses, from ""North Coast Abrasives, Inc."" to ""North Coast
Wood Products.""

At 58 I'm learning the cello. ""Opsimath"" inspired a poem. Thanks!

Opsimath

She plucked the open D-string on her cello,
Felt of its vibration, followed fading tremor
As it rose, expanded, filled the room, and then,
Evaporated. She, the aging opsimath, eager
To explore the strings of steel, membranous
Polished woods, the hollow core
And all its possibilities, placed index finger
Carefully and plucked again. D, clear and pure.

Re: ""hangdog""  No doubt that the delinquent canines would be given the
ultimate penalty---wasn't it Salem or another community caught up in witch
fever that executed several dogs along with the humans? And the 18th century
Brits, who would hang petty thieves (read _The Fatal Shore_) would probably
include the thieves' best friends as accomplices. I associate the word
with the sentiment expressed by the public who gathered at such executions,
those who stay ""until the last dog is hanged,"" whether sea-dog pirate,
highwayman, Fagin, or starving pilferer, all of whom hadn't a dog's chance

"A.Word.A.Day--sockdolager","sockdolager (sok-DOL-uh-juhr) noun

   1. A decisive blow or remark.

   2. Something exceptional or outstanding.

[Of unknown origin, apparently from sock.]

This sockdolager of a word has an unusual claim to fame in the US
history. It turned out to be the cue on which John Wilkes Booth
fired his shot at President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was watching the
play ""An American Cousin"" in Ford Theater on that fateful night. His
killer, Booth, an actor himself and aware of the dialog, knew the line
that brought the loudest burst of laughter from the audience was:

   ""Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, you sockdologising
   old man-trap.""

Booth fired his gun at that precise moment to muffle the loud noise
of his shot with the guffaws from the audience, and quietly escaped.

   ""This year's storm was a sockdolager. The white stuff pounded the East
   Coast.""
   Be Prepared, Richmond Times-Dispatch (Richmond, Virginia), Jan 17, 1996.

Today is Presidents' Day in the US. It's observed on the third Monday
of February to commemorate two of the most popular US presidents: George
Washington (born Feb. 22, 1732) and Abraham Lincoln (born Feb. 12, 1809).
Until 1971 both of these birth days were observed as public holidays,
Then, with typical American efficiency, we took the average of the two
dates and marked a single day -- third Monday of February -- to honor
not only Lincoln and Washington but all US presidents. In fact, almost all
US holidays are now observed on Mondays to create a nice three-day long
week-end.

It's an interesting exercise to look into this best-known office in the
world. It lasts only four years yet billions of dollars are spent to reach
that fabled post. The job entails extensive travel, public speaking,
commanding a large army, and making decisions that affect, for better
or worse, the remotest corners of this earth. To celebrate Presidents'
Day, this week we'll look at a few words with presidential connections. -Anu

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

Spring break for Travel 101 Students! (We will resume the frugal travel course in two weeks.)

Detroit's new terminal opens.  Part One - The Old.

Sometimes as I sit and read articles in news papers and other publications, I just wonder why my fellow writers extol things like the cost of a terminal, number of gates, whether or not you can buy a suit of clothes, or the number of seats set aside for caf? dining.  You get the dimensions, who built it, what it replaced and why, along with all sorts of other facts and figures.  Which, by the way, are virtually useless to travelers.

Last year, the airport code DTW, appeared on my boarding passes 38 times.  Once every 10 days, I was in the old Detroit terminal going from one flight to another.  Usually hauling kids and their toys along the way.  Coming into the International Terminal and connecting out of C-26 was an exercise in frustration!  Believe me, an hour from international to domestic was often not enough!  I listened as the pilots came on the intercom to tell us that, ""It will be just a minute folks before we push back from the gate because of traffic in the corridor behind us.""  Usually the minute was ten and capable of stretching to 15 or 20!  Bathrooms in the old terminal were few and far between.  I honestly don't recall a time I didn't see a line at the woman's bathroom during peak hours, so I would have to wait with my six year-old daughter since she was past the age of using the men's room.  Things like these and more were areas of concern to me, the real traveler, not how high the roof i!
s or what supports it or how many tiles were used in the ceiling.  So how does the new terminal stack up?  Phenomenally!

To really do the comparison, I flew from Grand Rapids to Indianapolis the evening of the 23rd.  Of course, we arrived early in Detroit for the connection and had to wait for a gate.  Passing through the old terminal, I noticed business as usual; heavy crowds even on a Saturday afternoon.  Things were in boxes behind the podiums ready to be moved and a sense of anticipation was afoot.  As I passed the entrance to the elevator that took NWA pilots and flight attendants to down to their lounge, many remarked that this would be their last trip to the dungeon.  I boarded my flight to Indianapolis? we had to wait for traffic behind us to ""clear the corridor.""  Ten minutes later, we were on our way.  Next week, the New Terminal!

See you on a Detroit flight soon,

Bob

"Happy New Year","
I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or get outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Deer Valley. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny.  I also swear I saw Hugh Hefner but he was only with one woman..so it
was probably just a look alike.

The town is loaded with intense looking film types with their dark rimmed
glasses...north face down jackets, cell phones and ski caps...its pretty
funny.  This morning I went for a jog around down town and on my way back
and there are all these people getting photographed along the street...you
look at them and try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like
any other guy.  The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out
their stories and photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in
this cafe and all are being used right now..it is very busy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe which is a new cafe/bakery in town
that is geared towards locals only business.  Business is booming since
they've been open. I was going to work there initially but declined bc I
felt I would be too busy with Deer Valley.  I started eating there everyday
when they opened and once I saw the great things they were doing I decided I
had to work there.  I typically go in for 5-6 hours starting at 7am....then
I have 2 hrs off then go into DV to work in the evening.  Windy Ridge
doesn't really feel like work. I really like the pastry chef. Her work has
great integrity and I would be proud to call her creations my own. I have
been able to do some savory food as well like casseroles and vegetable
tarts.

Deer Valley is also good.  I work mostly evenings and prepare sauces,
desserts, and plate for the two restaurants at the lodge and any evening
banquet business.  I don't do a lot of production at DV but I am gaining
experience in kitchen organization and working a la minut to get orders out.

It snowed yesterday for the first time in over a week.  And the sun is
shining brightly today. I will report to work shortly and work a banquet
tonight for some Sundance people.  I hope to you all soon when I have more
time to write individually.  I will also be coming home on Saturday.

Take care,
Mo.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

I don't know if this will help, but if Keith could ask Roberto if this can be retrieved, perhaps he'll have better luck than I did yesterday.

Ed,

To recover email, the person will need to submit a request to Roberto DeLeon in IT Security.  It will probably require the approval of that persons supervisor, Phillip Allen in this case.  I believe the access will be temporary, and it may be monitored.

Keith should be able to work through this process directly with Roberto.

Subject:	Curve Validation



Ed, I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand with regards to the curve validation project.

Project Progress:

John McKay and Sandra Brawner have completed validating the curves for the east.  PWC has a programmer who is working with Brad and me to see if he can upload the quotes from the electronic quotes we received as well as the reshaped curves that John and Sandra have prepared.

Joe and Troy have just about completed entering the quotes for Permian, Ship Channel, and Waha for the Texas desk.  However, they still need to shape and validate the curves.  

Denver and Kevin have begun working on entering the quotes for the central desk.

On the west we ran into a problem with retrieving the quotes.  Apparently Keith Holst had all the quotes electronically in his email.  However, when the Netco people were converting over to UBS, Enron's IT people destroyed all email that was sitting in the inboxes of these employees.  I've already checked with IT and they have assured me that there is no way to recover that data.  Susan has been working with Keith to see if he had sent any of these emails to others or saved them on his hard drive and thus, she has been able to recover at least part of the days.  Currently, we have quotes for Dec. 12 - 21 and Dec. 31 - Jan. 8.  All other days we are still missing data on.  This process took most of today and Susan will begin working on the quotes that she currently has tomorrow.  



Personnel Issues:

John Arnold was suppose to be back in the office today.  When he did not show, another call was put into him today.  I have not heard back on the status, but will check in the morning.

Both Russell Murrell and Martin Cuilla are suppose to be in tomorrow.

Khymberly has assured me that there isn't much likelihood of Jim Schwieger coming in at all.

Karen Scott needs to take this Friday off.  She had already booked a flight and was to have a long weekend with family.

Kevin Ruscitti will be taking off all of next week.  He and his wife had booked a trip to Mexico some time ago and he feels that this may be the only vacation he gets this year.  He has assured me that he will be here the rest of this week and the last week of February to help in whatever way he can.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kathy

"FW: requested historical extract","PWC has now completed loading the Truequote data into the templates for the basis curves which we were able to cross reference.  Sorry, but it appears that they are having some issues with the index quotes, but I will keep you posted.  I will be passing out an updated list with the cross references so that you can quickly identify which curves now have Truequote in them.  These curves are now available so that you can begin shaping and revising them.  As you complete the curves, please remember to update the status report so that PWC can begin taking a look at the completed work.  The progress report has been modified to include a field for quotes entered as well as when the revisions are completed by each trader.
 
Also,  Tim has listed below the contact and phone number of the Truequote representative if you would like to contact him to see if you can more easily match up the remaining Truequote curves with the Enron curves.

"A.Word.A.Day--glasnost","glasnost (GLAZ-nost) noun

   A policy of open discussion of political opinion and social issues and
   freer disclosure of information.

[From Russian glasnost (publicity), from glas (voice).]

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word glasnost in the sense
of `publicity' has been quoted in Russian dictionaries since the 18th
century. Vladimir Ilich Lenin (1870-1924) used it in the sense of freedom
of information, and dissident writer and Nobel laureate Aleksandr Isayevich
Solzhenitsyn (1918- ) used it in an open letter to the Soviet Writers'
Union in 1969. But it became a subject of serious public debate after an
Izvestiya editorial on Jan 19, 1985 invited letters on the topic. Mikhail
Gorbachev used the word on Mar 11, 1985 in his acceptance speech for the
post of General Secretary of the CPSU.

   ""Exposed to the harsh light of glasnost, racial preferences in education
   are withering. Such policies are already prohibited by the courts in
   Texas and by voter initiatives in California and Washington.""
   Cathy Young, The High Price of Racial Preferences, The Boston Globe,
   Jun 27, 2001.

"yo","Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--philomath
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/philomath.html

Today's word is interesting, as I live in Philomath, Oregon. Local myth
claims the town was named for one of the first colleges in Oregon, i.e.,
the College of Philosophy and Math.

--------------------------------

From: Emily Townsend (emily@physics.orst.edu)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--philomath

I lived for a couple of years in Philomath, Oregon, and attended Philomath
High School. I was told the town got its name from Philomath College that
was once located there. However, we pronounce it differently! Oregonians
are always looking for ways to distinguish outsiders, and often they can
be told by their mispronunciation of Philomath (correctly said
fil-OH-math), Eugene (you-JEAN not YOU-jean) and the Willamette river
(wil-LAM-it). I called the Benton County Historical Society who told me
that Philomath College existed from 1865 until 1929, and the scholars
there would have known Latin, and would have pronounced it correctly.
However all local people still alive have always known it to be pronounced
fil-OH-math, and there are lots of examples around Oregon where the
correct local pronunciation is not the same as the correct pronunciation
in the language of the word's origin.

Here is the Web site of City of Philomath : http://www.ci.philomath.or.us/

Subject: Sleeping in lectures...
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/philomath.html

As a math prof I think maybe you have it wrong when you describe sleeping
as a symptom of your `inability to endure any ""dull"" lectures'. It may be
exactly the mechanism that lets you endure them, not an inability. We rank
insomnia in increasing severity:

o Acute insomnia: unable to fall asleep in a seminar
o Chronic insomnia: unable to fall asleep in a colloquium
o Terminal insomnia: unable to fall asleep in a department meeting

Few are so badly off as the terminal level.

--------------------------------

From: Michele Berg (mrb6p5@admiral.umsl.edu)
Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--philomath

I wonder if you know why the philo- precedes the -math in this word? When
I think of any word with 'philo' attached to it, it's usually as a suffix.
You know, linguaphile, hydrophilic, etc.

   The combining form philo- or phil- is equally agreeable to lead
   or be led. There are numerous everyday words with this form at
   the lead: philosophy, philately, philander, philanthropy, etc.
   Some not-so-everyday words: philogyny (love of women), phillumenist
   (a collector of matchboxes), philharmonic (fond of music).  -Anu

You quoted Robert Frost in today's word. If two roads diverged in a wood,
wouldn't that makes four choices? I've always wondered about that.

Subject: Re: A.Word.A.Day--iracund
Refer: http://wordsmith.org/words/iracund.html

Hey, that wasn't too hard--I just had to clear away the ""noise"" from the
first word that came to my mind with that suffix (fecund). The answer to
your question is jocund, of course. I cannot think of any others ending
with ""-cund"". Are there others?

You may be sorry you asked that question because all the ""good students""
in the audience will want to rise to the challenge and respond to you. A
busy e-mail day! (Or will I be the only one? ;-)

Thank you for your wonderful service. It's the best way to start my day
(and this from a person who catalogs rare books [imprints from the
mid-1400s to the present] every day). To me, it is a toss-up whether the
words defined or the quote chosen is the most satisfying.

   Yes, I had this cousin of ""jocular"" and ""jocose"" in mind:
   ""jocund"", when I asked for an antonym of ""iracund"" with the
   same suffix. I did get a number of email responses on this,
   mostly correct, but a few with rather offbeat suggestions,
   such as, moribund, rubicund, fecund, rotund, irenic, and
   irascible.

   The word ""jocund"" doesn't get around as much these days but
   it's often found in the poetry of Oscar Wilde, William
   Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, William Shakespeare, John Donne,
   and many others. ""A poet could not but be gay, In such a
   jocund company"" (Wordsworth). A rare -cund: ""verecund"" (modest).
   BTW, librarians are my favorite kind of people.   -Anu

In the last issue of AWADmail, I invited comments from linguaphiles on
the state of American English's prevalence in their countries. Here is
a cross-section of responses.

--------------------------------

From: E.M. Fotheringham (em.fotheringham@ntlworld.com)
Subject: English/American words  & meanings

Not only spelling but also meaning of words has changed recently here in
the U.K. For example ""presently"" has always meant ""in a little while"",
""later on"", but increasingly it has come to mean ""now"", ""at this moment"",
as in ""presently house prices are rising."" Confusing to those of an older
generation!

--------------------------------

From: Robert Elliott (robert@alphyra.ie)
Subject: colour/color

With regard to your request for comments on US vs. international spelling,
I've found that the greatest influence of US spelling comes in the world of
programming, especially HTML; 'colour' isn't accepted as a keyword. I've also
found it prudent to place 'humor' as well as 'humour' in my web page's
keywords. Even going back to the days before the web, though, a program is
what one wrote on the computer, while a programme is what was on television.

--------------------------------

From: Natalia M. (asya@ehu.unibel.by)
Subject: Re: AWADmail Issue 53

Oh, of course, ""tonite"", ""neighbor"", ""color"", ""dialog"" -- we (in Russia)
perceive them as iniquitous mistakes that only Americans can make. Those
who have been to the US and lived there -- might use this variant, but not
academically (e.g. on a test it would be a serious mistake). The younger
(25-30 y.o.) generation of teachers, though, shows tendencies to accept both
variants.

--------------------------------

From: Andrew Lisec (aml2nd@yahoo.com)
Subject: English Abroad

Having taught English in Hungary for seven years (I recently returned to the
States), I witnessed something of a sea change in English usage there. In
1994, when I arrived in Budapest, British English was the standard, and
Hungarians with good English generally used British spelling, syntax and
pronunciation. The state language examination board was also biased towards
British English, in some cases (including a few of my own students)
penalizing candidates who used Americanisms. By the time I left, however, the
tables had largely turned, with American English becoming increasingly the
standard in language schools and in the business world. Even the hide-bound
state examination board now makes provision, if reluctantly, for the
""colonial"" version of English in its oral exam.

--------------------------------

From: Jonathan Danilowitz (jon-dan@barak-online.net)
Subject: British/American English

I was born and brought up in South Africa, but have lived in Israel for 30
years. At first, the ""Jerusalem Post"" newspaper followed British-English
usage, but some years ago, made a formal change to American-English. It was
hard to read for a time!

Today, US-style English prevails here, no doubt because of the change made at
the dominant English-language newspaper, and aided by the pervasive US TV
influence.

--------------------------------

From: Ian Douglas (ian@zti.co.za)
Subject: AWADmail Issue 53

Bad, and getting worse. Not just spelling as much as Americanisms.

From news bulletins on the radio:

""one hundred twenty"" instead of ""one hundred and twenty""

""they will meet Tuesday"" instead of ""they will meet on Tuesday""

And the horrendous ""in back of"" instead of ""behind"".

From a radio ad exhorting us to take part in the current census:

""fill out your form"" instead of ""fill in your form"".

Also particularly American words popping up like ""arraigned"", which has
never been used in SA. Same goes for ""plea-bargain"", which is being
introduced here in SA.

--------------------------------

From: Kathy Sham (kathy.sham@pixie.co.za)
Subject: American English outside the USA

A couple of thoughts from South Africa, where, for a long time,
we were exposed to a relentless diet of almost exclusively American TV
programmes, thanks to the Equity ban during the apartheid years. As a
result we've embraced US culture, dress, attitudes and language to an
enormous extent. Would you believe we've even forgotten how to
pronounce 'apartheid', using the US/German form so that it rhymes with
'height' whereas it should rhyme - appropriately enough - with 'hate.'

--------------------------------

From: Warwick Allen (warwick.allen.1@uni.massey.ac.nz)
Subject: Americanisms in other countries

I live in New Zealand and am conscious of the many Americanisms that have
entered our version of English. Some common examples are using 'gas' for
petrol, saying a date as ""November one"" or ""November first"", for example,
instead of ""first of November"" (when it's written people still use the form
DD/MM/YY) and pronouncing 'z' as 'zee' rather than 'zed'. Dropping the 'ue'
from 'analogue' seems to be almost universal.

Using 'good' as an adverb in place of 'well' is extremely common. I think
this might just be a result of grammar having not been taught in schools
here for a generation.

--------------------------------

From: Alessandra Ricci (alessandra.ricci@snamprogetti.eni.it)
Subject: Issue 53: US spelling in Italy

On the subject of US spelling, in Italy whenever we use the word ""center""
(for adverts, sport centers, shopping centers) we do it with the US
spelling, I think because it's more similar to Italian and I think for the
same reason we use ""color"" as in the famous ""United colors of Benetton"".

--------------------------------

From: Gareth Barlow (cyberrat@iafrica.com)
Subject: Re: American spelling

I've worked as an editor for a newspaper, and while South African spelling
is ""meant"" to be equivalent to British spelling, 90% of the articles
submitted to us used American spelling - much to my dismay (yes, we had to
change all the occurrences of incorrect spelling). What's more, those people
I have mentioned this fact to often reply along the lines of: ""So what? What
difference does it make?""

--------------------------------

From: Onward Lam (onward@hknet.com)
Subject: Re: UK vs US spellings

Similar to yourself, I have spent a good part of adult life in both places
using predominantly US-English or UK-English spelling. Though using mostly
the UK version, I have nevertheless, on occasion, been required to use the
US variant to avoid being penalised.

One of these variants that I will probably never adopt or get used to is the
use of the letter 'z' instead of 's' in the verb form '-ize' and '-ise'.
My only rationale for this predicament is the American's strong desire to
win at Scrabble (a ""Z"" scores 10 versus only 1 for an ""S"").

--------------------------------

From: Melanie Sheridan (mellygoround@access.net.au)
Subject: US English

Here in Melbourne, Australia, the official spelling favours the inclusion
of the letter u in words such as colour, favour, neighbour. Our daily
newspaper, The Age - and, I understand, all other Fairfax publications -
uses an American typesetting machine, which automatically spells these
words without the ""U"". While this endlessly frustrates purists such as
myself, who object to US spelling, it also causes amusement, and confusion:
a recent TV guide article on the soapie ""Neighbours"" for instance, included
a sentence, part of which read: ""the neighbors represented on Neighbours...""

--------------------------------

From: Ron Eden (roneden@remminteractive.com.au)
Subject: zeady words

A certain Australian public relations/marketing communications Company warn
that they will deduct penalty dollars from payments of writers who deliver
projects containing words spelt with American ""z's"" instead of
English/Australian ""s's"".

I asked one of the partners on one occasion what was the most regular
offender and she told me it was ""recognized"" rather than with an ""s"". She
got a note in the mail from a writer once, which stated he would be more
careful in the future. ""I apologize"", he wrote.

--------------------------------

From: Jonas Eklund (jonas.eklund@spray.se)
Subject: Swedish English

In reply to your inquiry on the various usages on English in non-English-
speaking countries, I can report that in Swedish schools (or at least the
one that I went to), each pupil supposedly chooses the kind of English he
or she wants to write: British, American (U.S.) or even Australian. My
mother being from ""over there,"" I obviously chose the American way of
putting words in writing.

The standard spelling and pronunciation taught in Sweden are traditionally
the British/upper-class English versions. However, the tendency in actual
usage among young people is towards compliance with the world hegemony of
American culture. I'm always rather surprised to hear another young Swede
speak British English fluently, and I'll suppose that he or she has lived
in Britain or has some other ties to that country.

--------------------------------

From: Anatole Beck (beck@math.wisc.edu)
Subject: British English

In the many years I have lived in England, on and off, I have made it my
business to learn their language. So I am constantly being taken off guard
by their adoptions of American usage. I first had a sense of this in 1973
when my son told me that half the students at his comprehensive school said
zee instead of zed for z. Later on, I was surprised to hear truck used for
what the Brits used to call a lorry. In British, a truck is a railway
carriage (not car) with only four wheels, principally for carrying cargoes
like coal. It is also the four-wheeled unit at each end of a standard
railway carriage, what Americans call a bogey. In British, a bogey was a
hole in golf played at par, but now they use the American version: one over
par. American words like tire for tyre have even crept into their lovely and
demanding crosswords (which have not yet been edited into crossword puzzles).

The really interesting thing is that in most cases, they do not hear the
change themselves. I tell them it is true, but they are unaware. Two of
the most interesting cases are metaphors, which I swear the British had
right thirty years ago, but now they use the (flawed) American version. One
is, ""You can't eat your cake and [still] have it"", and the other is ""Heels
over head in love."" Of course, you can have your cake and [then] eat it, but
not conversely. Heels over head is flipped over. Head over heels is standing
up straight. In this connection, the American usage ass backwards has not
yet been taken up. Of course, it is ass forwards which is the English
language translation of preposterous. Ass backwards is how things are
s'posed to be.

--------------------------------

From: Kelly Aparicio (kelly@palaciodurazno.com)
Subject: A.Word.A.Day--testudinate

Today's ""testudinate"" made me think about coincidences in different
languages. In Uruguay, smaller country, compared to its huge neighbors,
Argentina and Brazil, we usually refer to someone who is a lazy or rather
useless person, as ""pelotudo"" or ""boludo"" (these being non educated words,
but very accurate, as they mean that the balls or testes of such a person
weigh so much that he moves very slowly). From today on I'll be using
refined language when I use the term ""testudo"" instead.

--------------------------------

From: David King (dking@dal.dol-esa.gov)
Subject: Crabwise

This word reminded me of a Smothers Brothers bit. In a song the brothers
sing about the doomed love of a crab and a lobster. I remember the reason
why this love was doomed to failure as the brothers sang, ""because crabs
walk sideways and lobsters walk straight...""

--------------------------------

From: Gregory_Whitfield@notes.rlg.org
Subject: Crabs

Yesterday's word made me think of a musical term for playing a tune
backwards: cancrizans. It is used especially in fuguing when the theme goes
retrograde.

These headlines reminded me of one of my favourites. This was the headline
to an article that announced that Michael Foot (left wing MP in UK) was to
lead a group looking at nuclear disarmament : ""Foot Heads Arms Body"".

From: Barbara A. Kerr (kerr@bainbridge.net)
Subject: black and white

One of the comments in today's newsletter expressed a wish that ""black"" and
""white"" were more ambiguous--as is the word ""blue."" I'd like to suggest
that ""white"" at least does not always mean good. In fact, it can sometimes
imply that something is boring, deceptive, or dangerous: white noise,
whitewash, whiteout (as in a severe snow storm), white water, and--with
tongue in cheek--white male.

--------------------------------

From: Klyd Watkins (klyd@thetimegarden.com)
Subject: literal

How can we save the word ""literal""? Can we demand that no one on radio
or television use the word, unless they are licensed to do so, that
license to be granted only after a 500 word essay exam demonstrating
an understanding of its meaning? Can we offer a bounty to comedians
for ridiculing its misuse? I know I would chip in. We can't stop
change in language. But the word ""literal"" is very useful, used
correctly. The word is 180 degrees wrong when a figurative expression
is said to be literal, as in ""Carl Malone literally took the team on
his shoulders,"" or ""she literally broke his heart;"" but more
pernicious is the irrelevant use, when the expression is not
figurative to begin with, as in ""they literally helped a great deal""
or ""he literally came in and changed things."" This is becoming more
and more common. The word, which was never that common in its correct
usage, is becoming very popular, as a substitute for ""actually"" or
""truly"" or ""really."" It's all over the media, not just by sports
announcers but news anchors as well. Maybe you could have as a weekly
theme words whose meanings are changing in unfortunate ways. By
unfortunate in this case I mean that a word that precisely describes a
very specific situation, which is difficult to express without the
term, is coming to mean something which has many alternate
expressions, but there must be other ways words are becoming less
useful, or have already become less useful than with a previous meaning.

   I literally did a few themes on this topic last year. See ""Words often
   used in a sense different from their established definitions"" and
   ""Words that have reversed their meaning"" in January 2000 archive. -Anu

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101, LESSON FOUR - Planning

Sometime between Christmas and New Years, I determine where and approximately when I want to travel during the coming year.  I have two recurring annual trips that are pretty much in stone, but the remaining travels are based on what I think will be good values and opportunities in the coming year.

The destinations selected are generic.  That is, I will look at locations with similar attributes for a general time frame and not lock myself into a specific place.  As an example, Costa del Sol in southern Spain is lovely in late winter, and even though Morocco is located in Africa, it has a similar climate and may even undercut European prices. So while I plan a geographical area, I remain flexible in the exact location.

Regional ""destination"" selected, it is time to begin watching for specials.  These specials happen very quickly and require some effort to ensure availability.  The initial activity is to simply inform your travel agent, if you use one, of your general requirements and let them do the searching for you.  Tell them your travel window, general location and your budget limit. It is also important to advise them if your total budget includes meals. An all-inclusive package at Club Med may be just as good a deal or better than an ""on your own"" package where you choose the chow.

If you are planning trips on your own, via the Internet, identify sites like 11th Hour Vacations (http://www.11thhourvacations.com) to begin your search.  Be sure to check back often as this site specializes in last minute deals that come and go quickly.  Check the major carriers themselves as they offer vacation packages at extremely good prices.  Prices overall will remain low for some time as providers work hard to get folks back into the travel mode.  Airlines, cruise lines, hotels and other industry components are working hard to fill seats, berths and beds.  Even now, most travel sales extend well into the spring of 2002, which is a definite asset in planning. Keep your eyes open and you too can have a very affordable vacation this year!

See you on a flight soon,


Bob

"Employees who missed their 401-K contribution on the January 15, 2002 paycheck","
It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

"A.Word.A.Day--watergate","Watergate (WOH-tuhr-gayt) noun

   A scandal involving abuse of office, deceit, and cover-up.

[After Watergate office and residential complex in Washington, DC, the
site of a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in
1972 that resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon two years
later.]

Watergate, a scandal of mammoth proportions, has given us a useful suffix
for describing a wide variety of subsequent scandals, from monicagate to
enrongate, to the recent icegate or skategate, and hot off the press,
gategate: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26164-2002Feb17.html

   ""On this (campaign finance reform) bill and other political reforms,
   Congress should give primacy to the rights and needs of voters. Reform
   should not have to wait for a tangled election like the one just
   concluded - or a Watergate.""
   A Step Toward Reform, The Boston Globe, Mar 30, 2001.

SMART TRAVELERS' CORNER: This week, columnist Bob Jones provides tips on getting the best travel deal.

TRAVEL 101 - Lesson Five - Hidden airfare savings.

Many times travelers will access a site and ask for a specific carrier instead of just allowing the central reservation system to do what it does best, find the best price for your flight.  What many travelers don't realize is that the flights returned to your desktop may be ""code share"" flights.  These flights are ticketed on one carrier but flown on another.  As a general rule, these flights are between partner or alliance members but occasionally, you will find a code share between pure competitors such as Northwest and American Eagle in the Northeast.  The code share agreements may be ""left over"" from previous contracts between carriers but in any case, it is possible to save some money by looking at the fine print.  Case in point.

I am writing this on a Northwest 757 en route Seattle from Grand Rapids, MI.  When I initially shopped for tickets, the best I could do, specifying Northwest flights, was about $260 on a 21 day advance purchase.  While this was a good price, it was not great.  Resetting the parameters to ""any carrier,"" I found Continental had a flight, 5281 for $156.  What would be strange to the untrained eye is that the time of departure and arrival were exactly the same as Northwest flight 281...  Hmmmm...  flight 5281...  flight 281....  That's right, same airplane, different flight numbers.  By spending $100 less, I was able to fly on a Northwest flight using a Continental ticket and flight number.  Granted, I lost some frequent flyer bonus miles in doing so but in this case the money saved on the ticket was substantially more than the lost bonus miles.  Okay, so why couldn't I find the $156 fare on Northwest?

There are lots of imponderables in air travel.  First, why does a round-trip ticket cost less than a one way?  I get this question a lot and frankly, have never found a satisfactory answer for reply.  It is right up there with riddle of the Sphinx and ""why does a one liter bottle of Coke cost more than a two liter bottle?""  But back to code sharing.  What has probably occurred in this case is simply that Northwest sold out their allotment of seats in this particular fare basis while Continental did not.  Therefore, armed with knowledge of how code shares worked, I was able to save $100!  Something I so enjoy doing!

So when you are looking for flights, compare flight numbers and times. There is a good chance you can save a few dollars by picking the code share over the ""real carrier"" itself.

See you on a flight soon,

Bob
