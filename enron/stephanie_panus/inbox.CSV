Tana,

I am following up on the issue for Maureen Piercey who is out of the
office.

Will the TransAlta guarantee provided to Enron North America for financial
deals be acceptable? TransAlta currently sleeves the financial deals
through Enron Canada, and TransAlta can not continue to do this due to the
administrative difficulties that are created by this process.

Please let me know if the guarantee attached below is acceptable, and if
Enron North America will be will to sign the ISDA amendment. If you want to
contact me directly, my number is 403-267-6992.

Thanks,

Prior to the execution of the ISDA Master, LD had crossed out some stuff on their confirms (ex. governing law) and stuff on the Annex - and we have been unable to fully execute these outstanding deals.  So... since any outstanding deals are now covered by the Master, what do we do about the ones that weren't fully executed and had markups?

Can you remind me what the problems were?  If they were related to confirming trades, all trades should now be confirmed under the Master Agreement and all trades that were confirmed prior to the execution of the Master will also now be governed by the Master.

Hey Stephanie.  Now that they have signed this ISDA for Louis Drefus Energy Services, LP, how does that effect the confirmations that have been sent out in the past?  We are assuming this ISDA addressed the problems that were sent up to legal a few months ago (Frank Sayre) and we now need to know how to move forward and get our existing confirmations executed.  Can you confirm if it did address the issues we sent to legal and how we need to proceed to get these outstanding confirmations executed?  

Thanks.

FYI, we have confirmations in 'Sent to Counterparty' status since December 13, 2000.

Please approve or make changes to their new NDA.  They need to change the counterparty name due to a joint venture.

Diamond-san,

As I wrote in the past, Nissho Iwai's LNG related department
has been transferred into a new joint venture company between
Nissho and Sumitomo Corp. as of October 1, 2001, namely,
 ""LNG Japan Corp."".

In this connection, we would like to conclude another NDA with
LNG Japan Corp, as per attached.

Please review it and it would be great if you could make original again
and send us for Mr.Miyazawa's signature.

Also, please advise us how we should treat Nissho's NDA in these
circumstances.

BTW, I talked with Mr.Matsubara, Manager of Enron Global Finance in Tokyo.
We are internally discussing when we start our official meeting.
Please let us know when you are ready.

Regards,

LNG Japan Corporation
D.Kobayashi

I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your email/attachments
fo 24 July.

Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that
once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ... I
expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the address
details and a few other similar minor items.

Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

"East Power Meeting","We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Subject:	Outstanding EOL PA's

Hi Tana,

I was just wondering if you could assist with the status of the following PA's.  I understand these are awaiting approval by Legal and Contracts, Houston, having already been approved by Credit, Sydney:

	Company			Name			Date Submitted
NTT Communications		Taka Maeda		7 June 01
Yuen Foong Yu Paper		Yileng Tseng		10 Aug 01
Beijing Zhengcheung Technology	Mr. Hwzhao		17 Aug 01
Moraka Pte				Venkatesh Raman	13 Sept 01
Terragate Pty Ltd			Charlie Bell		12 Sep 01
Mitsui Mining Australia		Akihiro Imazawa		9 Oct 01
Coal & Allied Operations		Matthew Wall		6 Nov 01
Nipponkoa Insurance		Kenji Terauchi		6 Nov 01

As I am sure you can appreciate, I have had several inquiries regarding these applications.  With the exception of the last 2 which have only recently been entered, these PA's for the most part seem to be taking quite a long time.  Any information you can provide regarding the status of any of the above would be greatly appreciated

Thank you and regards,

"Enron Legal Edge Signon Changes","Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.

Forward Email to Administrative Staff
Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you.

Contact Us
If you would like to provide feedback for the Single Sign-On effort, send an email to sso@enron.com. If you have issues or concerns regarding this change, please contact the Resolution Center at ext. 3-1411.


Regards,
The Legal Edge and Single Signon Teams
sso@enron.com

"RE: XL Trading Partners Ltd","Adele,
I reviewed the opinion and there were several changes to the form from the prior draft.  I would like to discuss two of the additions with your counsel if that would be ok with you.  The first addition at issue is subpart k at the end of the first paragraph on page two.  It looks like we may need a representation from you that you are not and will not carry on investment business in or from within Bermuda and that you will not perform your obligations under the Agreement in or from within Bermuda in order for the opinion to have value.  The second addition at issue is subpart (e) under section 8 of the opinion.  As written it looks like a large loop hole that can be taken advantage of just by finding evidence that was not submitted at the trial.  Our General Counsel is concerned with what looks like an easy way to circumvent a foreign judgment.  I would appreciate your thoughts or any clarification I can get.  

Regards,
Brent Hendry

I'm unable to find anything, could be because it's so recent.  I don't show that we're doing any business w/ Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc., can't find any record in GCP, so I'm not sure how this would affect us.  When I run out of resources, I just call them.

Subject:	East Power Meeting

We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

We are verifying our consent to your change in the Interest Rate definition.

Please review collateral threshold to be sure it is as our credit departments agreed.  I believe it is.

Gaffney will attach form of guaranty in the execution process.

As and when finally approved, our paralegal, Stephanie Panus, will commence final version paperwork and send to Gaffney for our execution and guaranty supplement, and he will forward to you.

"RE: East Power Meeting","I believe Wabash has also terminated.
 
Don,
As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.   Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.   I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.
 
I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm.

Subject: East Power Meeting



We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts. 

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week. 

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002 
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002 
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002 
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).

Ameren Energy 
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks, 

Don

"RE: Confidentiality Agreement","
Derek,
 
I spoke to Stephanie yesterday and she updated the Confidentiality Agreement following our discussion.  The following references status of the points discussed:
 
1.    The updated agreement includes a definition of ""affiliate"".  This is acceptable to me.  
 
2.    Two year term.  This is okay.
 
3.    Request for Californiajurisdiction.  Stephanie said they could not agree to a Californiajurisdiction.  Her argument calling for a New Yorkjurisdiction is that the purpose of the Confidentiality Agreement is to facilitate a credit review, and Enron is familiar with dealing with credit matters under New Yorklaw.  
 
4.    Arbitration.  I told her we would agree to no changes on Arbitration wording from Enron format.
 
 
I told Stephanie that I would discuss with you before I get back to her.  
 
Thanks.

I have one additional (and substantial) change that needs to be made to the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. guaranty.  We will be trading both financially and physically with this counterparty, so the guaranty needs to be written accordingly.  It appears that the guaranty as currently drafted is intended solely for financial trading.

Please call me with any questions.

Frank--

Just a couple of credit comments for the attached gty's:

For the e prime, inc. Gty:
Change the name of Excel Energy Inc. to Xcel Energy Inc. in the header
Under the first Whereas, add Enron Canada Corp. (fka Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.) (""ECC"") as an additional Enron Entity being covered under this gty
Under the 4th Whereas clause, insert ECC as another Enron entity being covered for the physical transactions (confirmed under short term gas contracts)
On the 2nd page, 2nd paragraph--should we define what ""Enron Parties"" means???
Also, does it matter whether the counterparty's name is in all caps???  They represent it in small caps on all of their docs.

For the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. Gty:
Add Enron Canada Corp. as an additional Enron entity
Insert another Whereas clause (after the first Whereas clause) that specifies the physical gas transactions with ENA and ECC under certain contracts (none executed yet) or confirmations
Again, do the small caps really matter???

That should be all, unless Jay has some more to add.  Please let me know whether you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help on this!

Veronica

Please find attached copies of two draft guarantees for the e prime group of companies.  The first guarantee is a very complex $30 million one that is based upon e prime Inc.'s relationship with the company as far as Stephanie Panus and I can tell from existing records.  Please review it very very (mucho very) carefully since you are much more familiar than we are with the physical side of this guaranty (especially the reference to ""credit, loans or advances"" that we simiply copied from the previous guaranty to the present one).  The second guaranty is a much simpler one in the amount of $10 million covering e prime Energy Marketing Inc.'s trading under thieir new ISDA. Based on my conversations with Jay, this is the guaranty structure desired by e prime.  Thanks
