"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Attached for your review is a draft of the ISDA Master Agreement between
Enron North America Corp. and Quadra Energy Trading Ltd.  Please note
that the actual Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex are preprinted
forms from ISDA and cannot be sent electronically.  Therefore, I am also

"FW: Revised Loss Definition.DOC","Kim and Dan,
In an effort to come to closure on the one final issue I propose the following language.  
""(e)	Payments on Early Termination.  For the purpose of Section 6(e):  (i) Market Quotation shall apply to natural gas and crude oil Transactions with a remaining term at the time of the Early Termination of less than one year and Loss will apply to all other Transactions, and (ii) the Second Method will apply.""

I believe that this provision would cover the vast majority of SAC's trades with Enron which are the types of trades which Enron considers most liquid.  This also addresses our concern of not having to obtain quotations on illiquid positions.  We would be willing to modify the Loss definition as set forth below (as proposed in my last email) which also addresses some of your concerns with the standard version of the Loss definition (while recognizing that it does not address all your concerns).  We believe this to be a fair compromise that attempts to address the concerns of both parties.  Please review the proposal and let me know if we can send a final blacklined copy of the agreement for your review.

Regards,
Brent 

 
""The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

""Loss"" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a replacement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Furthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant market.""

Stephanie,
 
Please send forward your preliminary memo to me concerning PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.  If you sent one earlier, I never received it.
 
It is vital that we get these memos because it signals us to check EOL immediately as to whether or not we have to set up a shell agreement for a contract number so the counterparty can do on-line trading. 
 
Thanks,

Subject:	FW: Revised Loss Definition.DOC

Kim, 

I have reviewed the language your counsel sent and have discussed it with our General Counsel.  We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but not the other two damage concepts.  We do not agree to the removal of ""cost of funding"" since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transaction requires a premium to be paid because of the off-market position.  Premiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component.  The removal of the concept of ""loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating, liquidating, or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position"" is also a very real factor in calculating damages.  It may very well be that the termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing the transaction.  Furthermore, the you can obtain the same effect of terminating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction (the equivalent of a replacement transaction) rather than an outright termination with the hedge counterparty. Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of the coin, so to speak, it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss.  We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication, which I think was one of your outside counsels concerns.  The definition of Loss as was written is designed so that the Non-defaulting party can recover the actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Party's failure to perform.  If the Defaulting Party objects to the Non-defaulting Party's calculation then such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and final determination by a New York court.  

We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows: 

Insert the following into Part 1(e), after the period at the end thereof.  

""The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

""Loss"" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a replacement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Furthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant market.""


 If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also willing to use the following definition, which was originally drafted by Goldman Sachs, in lieu of the Loss definition.
  
""Replacement Value"" , means, with respect to each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, an amount that the party (the ""Determining Party"") or its agent determines in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and costs (or gains, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions.  A Determining Party (or its agent) may determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions, any group of Terminated Transactions or individual Terminated Transactions, and may apply different valuation methods to different Transactions or groups of Transactions.   A Determining Party (or its agent) will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as of the Early Termination Date, or, if that would not be commercially reasonable, as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates after the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under then prevailing circumstances.

The definition of Loss would be replaced throughout the ISDA by the definition of Replacement Value.  

We hope that one of these definitions will work for you.  Please call if you have any questions or comments on the definitions.

Regards,
Brent

The alternate letter of credit format is fine.  With respect to his other question on the collateral rounding, what is your thought on this?  If you let me know, we will respond to Gary Ross.

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Jaime--if the counterparty continues to dispute, we need to receive audited year end 2000 financials and 2001 quarterly financial position reports to reevaluate.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Justin/Edmond,
We need to prepare an Enron Corp. Guaranty for Carr Futures.  I have been told that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr.  Can someone in your office verify this and let me know the date of the agreement?

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.

"RE: Confidentiality Agreement with Enron","Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of ""Representative"" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution

Legal -

Attached below is an Omnibus Confirm worksheet for BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.   Please prepare the appropriate annexes and forward to the financial confirmations group as soon as possible.

 << File: BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1 Omnibus Confirmation.xls >> 



Financial Confirms -

Upon receipt of the credit annexes from Legal, please send out confirms for the following trades:

YJ4705.1		YJ7870.1
YJ4707.1		YJ7870.2

Please note that these trades are currently booked to BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P.  This is, obviously, not the correct counterparty name.  Please correct and send confirmations at your earliest convenience.




Derek and George -
 
I have Global Counterparty setting up this new entity in our systems.  Please ensure that these trades get moved from BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P. to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  Margin calculations are dependent on these trades being booked correctly.  While Mike Larsen has been very accomodating, our margin team can not afford to spend time reconciling trades at the present.



Thanks to all for your help.

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

I assume the parties are  ENA and ECTRIC with Carr Futures, Inc. I do not have any information about this though nor do I have a contact.  Sheila can you provide this information to Sara?

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Stephanie

If we are seeking to put in place a multi commodity guaranty, what has become of natural gas and emissions? I thought we were going to include these as well, any reason why these are not included in the guaranty? Are there any other commodities we would want covered under this guaranty?
	
I have made the change to reflect that I would hope that Exelon would in fact execute an EEI Master Agreement, the same change will need to be made to both documents	
I would prefer it if New York law governed these guarantees.

Please see attached mark-up.

"New Temp IDs","Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Justin/Edmond,
We need to prepare an Enron Corp. Guaranty for Carr Futures.  I have been told that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr.  Can someone in your office verify this and let me know the date of the agreement?

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Hi Tana.

Could you please forward a NDA for the possible sale of EnronOnline functionality to the following person?  The NDA would be similar to the one you did for Equiva and Louis Dreyfus.

The contact information is:

Mr. Roger Parks

Thank you.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

"RE: Vitol/Enron ISDA","Hi, Stephanie

VCM has an office in bermuda and in Houston ... you will tend to deal with
the Houston office most of the time on trading, invoicing and collateral

I trust that this answers your question

      Hello, Stephanie,

      I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your
      email/attachments
      fo 24 July.

      Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope
   that
      once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
      implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ...
   I
      expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the
      address
      details and a few other similar minor items.

      Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

Darren:
I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a ""regulatory out"" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

"The Shed","I was going to bed the other night when my wife told me that I had left the light on in the shed, she could see from the bedroom window. As I looked for myself, I saw that there were people in the shed taking things. 

I phoned the police, but they told me that no one was in his area to help at this time, but they would send someone over as soon as they be available. 

I said OK, hung up, and waited one minute, then phoned the police back. ""Hello. I just called you a minute ago because there were people in my shed. Well, you don't have to worry about them now because I've shot them all."" 

Within five minutes there were half a dozen police cars in the area, an Armed Response unit, the works. Of course, they caught the burglars red-handed. One of the officers said: ""I thought you said that you'd shot them!"" 

I replied with ""I thought you said there was nobody available!""

Subject:	RE: Confidentiality Agreement with Enron

Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of ""Representative"" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of ""Representative"" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.
[Panus, Stephanie]  
We can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Thanks and best regards,

Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution
copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via
email or at the number below.

Restated Guaranty from FPL Group Capital to Enron entities, incorporating
the  changes requested by Enron.  Please confirm that you are comfortable
with  the modification in paragraph 2 of assuming responsibility that Enron
actually receives your notice in the event that you desire to terminate the
Guaranty.  As always, please do not hesitate to call with any  questions.

"Vitol/Enron ISDA","Hi, Stephanie,

I wanted to check where we are on the ISDA ... we sent you a proposal at the
end of Sept, and you and I have exchanged a couple of emails since then, but
overall I believe that the ball is still ' in your court'.  Is this correct?

"RE: ISDA Master Agreement","Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Subject:	RE: Confidentiality Agreement with Enron

Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of ""Representative"" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of ""Representative"" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.
[Panus, Stephanie]  
We can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution

Frank -

I have one additional (and substantial) change that needs to be made to the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. guaranty.  We will be trading both financially and physically with this counterparty, so the guaranty needs to be written accordingly.  It appears that the guaranty as currently drafted is intended solely for financial trading.

Please call me with any questions.

Frank--

Just a couple of credit comments for the attached gty's:

For the e prime, inc. Gty:
Change the name of Excel Energy Inc. to Xcel Energy Inc. in the header
Under the first Whereas, add Enron Canada Corp. (fka Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.) (""ECC"") as an additional Enron Entity being covered under this gty
Under the 4th Whereas clause, insert ECC as another Enron entity being covered for the physical transactions (confirmed under short term gas contracts)
On the 2nd page, 2nd paragraph--should we define what ""Enron Parties"" means???
Also, does it matter whether the counterparty's name is in all caps???  They represent it in small caps on all of their docs.

For the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. Gty:
Add Enron Canada Corp. as an additional Enron entity
Insert another Whereas clause (after the first Whereas clause) that specifies the physical gas transactions with ENA and ECC under certain contracts (none executed yet) or confirmations
Again, do the small caps really matter???

That should be all, unless Jay has some more to add.  Please let me know whether you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help on this!

Regards,

Veronica

Subject:	e prime guarantees

Please find attached copies of two draft guarantees for the e prime group of companies.  The first guarantee is a very complex $30 million one that is based upon e prime Inc.'s relationship with the company as far as Stephanie Panus and I can tell from existing records.  Please review it very very (mucho very) carefully since you are much more familiar than we are with the physical side of this guaranty (especially the reference to ""credit, loans or advances"" that we simiply copied from the previous guaranty to the present one).  The second guaranty is a much simpler one in the amount of $10 million covering e prime Energy Marketing Inc.'s trading under thieir new ISDA. Based on my conversations with Jay, this is the guaranty structure desired by e prime.  Thanks

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

James,
Can you confirm whether or not ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr Futures and what the date of such agreement is?  We need to provide Carr with an Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Thanks,

Sheila,
Do you know who in London works on futures/brokerage agreements?  I'm trying to find out if ECTRIC has an agreement with Carr.

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

I assume the parties are  ENA and ECTRIC with Carr Futures, Inc. I do not have any information about this though nor do I have a contact.  Sheila can you provide this information to Sara?

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

"Comments from Chisholm","Mark,

We sent Chisholm an electronic copy of the LOI and received some comments.  

in paragraph 2, Chisholm would like to see something other than obligation, as we never state what is our 'current obligation.'  I guess the word 'obligation' raises an eyebrow.  We explained that the NDA and its conditions would still be in place.  Is there a way to tweak the language to more clearly state this and not use 'obligation'?

of course the non-solicitation clause was another point of clarification.  Currently, Chisholm is using students to develop an internal system and they have been working with other vendors.   Therefore, this clause will not work.  So we have discussed putting in a Notification clause in that Chisholm will notify us and keep us informed about the status of other vendors.  Perhaps something that would read ""Chisholm agrees that it will notify Enron if and when it decides to enter into a formal agreement with any third party vendor etc.""   


Give me a call if this doesn't make sense.  Thanks.

Frank -

I have one additional (and substantial) change that needs to be made to the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. guaranty.  We will be trading both financially and physically with this counterparty, so the guaranty needs to be written accordingly.  It appears that the guaranty as currently drafted is intended solely for financial trading.

Please call me with any questions.

Subject:	RE: e prime guarantees

Frank--

Just a couple of credit comments for the attached gty's:

For the e prime, inc. Gty:
Change the name of Excel Energy Inc. to Xcel Energy Inc. in the header
Under the first Whereas, add Enron Canada Corp. (fka Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp.) (""ECC"") as an additional Enron Entity being covered under this gty
Under the 4th Whereas clause, insert ECC as another Enron entity being covered for the physical transactions (confirmed under short term gas contracts)
On the 2nd page, 2nd paragraph--should we define what ""Enron Parties"" means???
Also, does it matter whether the counterparty's name is in all caps???  They represent it in small caps on all of their docs.

For the e prime Energy Marketing, Inc. Gty:
Add Enron Canada Corp. as an additional Enron entity
Insert another Whereas clause (after the first Whereas clause) that specifies the physical gas transactions with ENA and ECC under certain contracts (none executed yet) or confirmations
Again, do the small caps really matter???

That should be all, unless Jay has some more to add.  Please let me know whether you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help on this!

Regards,

Veronica

Subject:	e prime guarantees

Please find attached copies of two draft guarantees for the e prime group of companies.  The first guarantee is a very complex $30 million one that is based upon e prime Inc.'s relationship with the company as far as Stephanie Panus and I can tell from existing records.  Please review it very very (mucho very) carefully since you are much more familiar than we are with the physical side of this guaranty (especially the reference to ""credit, loans or advances"" that we simiply copied from the previous guaranty to the present one).  The second guaranty is a much simpler one in the amount of $10 million covering e prime Energy Marketing Inc.'s trading under thieir new ISDA. Based on my conversations with Jay, this is the guaranty structure desired by e prime.  Thanks

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

There are no comments on the Guaranty.  I have received two different guaranty versions from Enron. In my last phone conversation with Darren Vanek on 8/8/01, Darren indicated he was going to talk to Stephanie about providing one guaranty for both financial and physical transactions.

You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Subject:	RE: Confidentiality Agreement with Enron

Dear Ms. Panus,

I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with
reference to the following issues:

1)  Description of ""Representative"" was too broad.  We feel accessing
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.

[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of ""Representative"" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.

2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential
indefinitely.
[Panus, Stephanie]  
We can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.

3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.

4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for
a Confidentiality Agreement.

[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.

Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.

Thanks and best regards,

Mr. Wise,
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.

If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution
copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via
email or at the number below.

"Sorry I missed your call","
Hey Steph,
I hope you had a nice weekend.  We were at the grocery when you called and then we had plans to go to the movie later in the day, so I didn't have a chance to call you back.  We saw Amelie.  I loved it.  It makes me yearn for Paris.  I truly love that city.  So romantic.
 
Anyway, not much happening on this end.  Just getting ready for Thanksgiving.  We are doing the orphan thing and going over to our friend Virginia's to feast, drink and watch movies on her new Sony Dream System, alias Wet Dream System according to her.  It should be mellow and relaxing.  What are you doing for the holiday?  Are you getting together with family?
 
So, is Raymond fully recovering and eager to get back to work?  Or has he put on 50 lbs and become a recluse?  I hope he is doing well.
 
Gotta run, but let's do chat soon.
Give my love to the furry boys,

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Credit Annexes","Legal friends - 

Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments.  One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the ""title"" of the Annexes.  Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number.   We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific.

This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex.  However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number.  Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. 

So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?  

Let me know if I'm missing part of a bigger picture or if you have questions.

Thanks,
Diane

"Re: Flu Shots","Unfortunately the appointment schedule for flu shots this week is completely full.  You may ask why.....well, the amount of vaccine we received for this first round was very small.  Don't despair, our supplier has notified us that we may be receiving another shipment of vaccine by the end of next week.  We cannot start to schedule yet since we do not know how much vaccine we're getting, nor when we will be getting it. Please check back with us or keep an eye on your Enron email as we will be sending out an announcement regarding the second round of flu shots.  

We appreciate your patience regarding this matter.


Thank you.

Regarding the waiting list that was announced through Enron in Action - we have not been instructed to keep a waiting list.  That seems to be an error.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Please check back with us or look for an email message regarding the next round of flu shots.

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Could you please prepare an NDA for Accenture LLP.  Tana has a draft document in her directory that has their address on it.

Jennifer:

BASF slipped by.  I really thought I had taken care of that one, but I will have it completed this morning.  FYI: sometimes Credit has completed its part and Legal needs to review.  Until PCG flips the status to ""Legal Reviewing"" the status will still reflect ""Credit Reviewing"".  This usually happens intraday, as PCG is diligent about updating the status field.

Just wondering if things are moving ok from credit to legal in the pa database, as I seem to keep running into cps that your comment says credit approved, but the status is still at credit reviewing....
The latest is BASF Corporation. Can you make sure this moves on to legal? Gracias!

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

"FW: Carr Futures","Sara,
I have tracked down James Canney in London, who works with ECTRIC's brokerage/futures matters.  They do have an agreement with Carr, but do not have a copy of the agreement.  He is trying to get a copy from Carr.

Stephanie, Carr have come back to me and say they have some kind of contract with Enron Capital and Trade International but the person I spoke to needs managerial approval to send me a copy.
The manager is my normal contact so will hopefully be able to get a copy tomorrow...

Can you confirm whether or not ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr Futures and what the date of such agreement is?  We need to provide Carr with an Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

We need to prepare an Enron Corp. Guaranty for Carr Futures.  I have been told that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr.  Can someone in your office verify this and let me know the date of the agreement?

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

   I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your
   email/attachments
   fo 24 July.

   Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that
   once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
   implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ... I
   expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the
   address
   details and a few other similar minor items.

   Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

The IT dept has looked at our printers and nothing can be done to increase the memory so that I can print the scanned documents.  I am going to have to request hard copies from you each month.

"RE: Exelon Generation","Stephanie

If we are seeking to put in place a multi commodity guaranty, what has become of natural gas and emissions? I thought we were going to include these as well, any reason why these are not included in the guaranty? Are there any other commodities we would want covered under this guaranty?
	
I have made the change to reflect that I would hope that Exelon would in fact execute an EEI Master Agreement, the same change will need to be made to both documents	
I would prefer it if New York law governed these guarantees.

Please see attached mark-up.
	
Regards,
	
Marcus

I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I

I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange

Stephanie,
Have you had a chance to review the amendments?  Our traders are very eager
to trade with Enron NA (and are asking about it several times a day - I'm
sure you know how it goes!).  Please let me know if there is anything I can
do to help expedite the process.  Thanks a bunch.

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya,
I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Apparently CSFB neglected to ask us to complete the attached corporate resolution when we executed the broker agreement.  If we could fill out and forward on that would be great.

"CSFB agreement","Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

"Hi","Hey, Jen,
What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey & Michael are going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office these days.

"RE: Enbridge Marketing","Patrick,
I have the documentation for the name change.  It should be Enbridge Marketing (U.S.) Inc.  I am processing the paperwork and Diane should receive the usual copy from me.

In TAGG, the name appears as MidCoast Marketing.  But when we generate the confirm, it says Enbridge Marketing.  So with that in mind, should we hold off sending these confirms?

Stephanie,

We have some deals that are generating differently than they appear.  Has MidCoast Marketing changed its name to Enbridge Marketing Inc.?


Thanks,

Patrick

Nidia has changed her mind there is no credit on this deal.  They will need a deemed ISDA though.  Can you follow up with Nidia to see who is drafting the confirm so we can send them the appropriate deemed ISDA.

Brent,

Please draft a language for the Credit provision section of USFC confirmation saying the following:

Vivendi Universal, S.A. needs to provide a $10 million parent gty. to ENA covering United States Filter Corporation for financial obligations.  This gty. needs to be received by Oct. 24, 2001.  Failure to provide this gty. will make United States Filter Corporation on default.

Attached is the gty. format.
