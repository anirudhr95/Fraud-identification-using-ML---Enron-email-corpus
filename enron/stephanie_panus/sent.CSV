Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Below is a list of gas trades that were originally between Columbia Energy Services and ENA, which Settlements is trying to reconcile.  CES says they are not their trades, and they do not appear to be part of the trades that were assigned from CES to New Power.  Can you give me anymore information on them?

Thanks.

Hi, Stephanie,

I wanted to check where we are on the ISDA ... we sent you a proposal at the
end of Sept, and you and I have exchanged a couple of emails since then, but
overall I believe that the ball is still ' in your court'.  Is this correct?

"FW: ENMAX Energy Corp","Wendy,
I think the amendment only brought the collateral threshold to zero for trades after Dec. 31, 2001.  There was no mention in the amendment of the new ENMAX entity.  We sent a draft ISDA for ENMAX Energy Marketing, Inc. but have not heard anything from them.

I think this might be your matter.  Could you advise Wendy as to your findings.

Thanks.

Susan,

Could you please follow up with the above referenced counterparty to see where they are on our amendment to the existing ISDA?  This amendment provides for ENMAX Energy Marketing Inc. as a new contracting party under the agreement.  

Thanks for you help!

Wendy

There has been some confusion on this ISDA/CSA since originally there was no electronic version.  I have tried to incorporate all comments into this electronic document.  Please make all written comments directly on this document.   If you prefer, you may call me to discuss comments at (302) 455-9282.
There are no comments on the Guaranty.  I have received two different guaranty versions from Enron. In my last phone conversation with Darren Vanek on 8/8/01, Darren indicated he was going to talk to Stephanie about providing one guaranty for both financial and physical transactions.
