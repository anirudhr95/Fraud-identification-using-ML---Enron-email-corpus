"Relo Expenses,  etc.","

Kim,
	My relo expenses have not been turned in as yet.    Do I turn those in to you?     I am due the closing costs, etc.  due to my move from Portland.
Also,   Johnny Palmer was very pleasant to speak with.    I appreciate the effort that you have made in trying to generate interest in me from the inside.
Johnny, however,   was not optimistic that he had anything available for a Director level position. 
	  I have been talking with Portland (Greg Wolfe,  Tim Belden,  and Amy Fitzpatrick)    If nothing opens up here by Wednesday,   I need to get out to the West and start training so that I can make some money for the company.
I am still building,  staffing, & trading for the Ercot region,  but I am eager to go quickly if no one wants me in Houston.    

Thanks!

"FW: Frontera Resource Plan - Min/Max MWs","
FYI,
This morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.    Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.    I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.    We ran at 280,  but our resource plan was not updated.     Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.   It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.

The point is,   the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.    We must reflect our true minimums at all times.    If the situation changes intraday,  we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.

Importance:	High

All,

ERCOT is questioning us the resource plan we put in the MOS, especially the Min/Max MWs for STG001. If we only have one CT running, then the Min/Max for ST would be 58/80 MWs instead of 130/184 MWs. Here is a list of points I got from Frontera for your reference:

1. One CT running:
	CTG101		STG001
MW	80		58
MW	100		64
MW	110		66
MW	120		68
MW	130		70
MW	140		74
MW	150		80

2. Both CT's running:
	CTG101		CTG201		STG001
MW	80		80		130
MW	100		100		140
MW	110		110		148
MW	120		120		151
MW	130		130		154
MW	140		140		158
MW	150		150		165

If you have questions, please let me know. Thanks.

The unit specific instruction tells us the level that they want the unit to produce.    The category one is just a summary of how much we need to move to achieve the unit specific level.   These should not be combined .

Also,  when you receive a category 2, 3 or 4 we are essentially receiving an OOM type instruction that is settled under the OOM provisions.

Subject:	RE: Question


Jeff,
If you've rec'd a deployment instruction that is a Category 2,3  or 4, it implies the deployment is to relieve operational, or local, CONG.   The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch algorithm has determined your unit is  located such that its movement per the instructions will help to alleviate the  local congestion.  Following is copied from the document, ""Market  Bulletin-Thursday August 8, 2001"".  This is the last paragraph on page 2 of  that document.
""Therefore, when Operational  Congestion exists, the solution found in STEP 1 may be augmented in STEP 2 with  both resource specific and modified portfolio awards. The result of STEP 2 is  always a set of final portfolio based and resource specific dispatch  instructions to be issued to the QSEs to solve the operational congestion.  Because the final portfolio based dispatch instruction equals the net result of  the preliminary STEP 1 portfolio based balancing energy awards and any STEP 2  portfolio adjustments, the QSE's bid curve may not match the MCPE  determined in STEP 1. This may be causing the appearance of being incorrectly  ""struck"". Whenever a QSE receives unit specific deployments, it will  also receive a Category 1 portfolio based deployment. ERCOT expects that the  portfolio-based instruction will be followed.""
So, even though your customer is determining your bids, your  unit could be called upon to relieve any local Cong that results from ""Step 1""  (per the referenced bulletin) deployments to resolve load/gen imbalances and  zonal cong, if that unit is deemed to have an effect (the shift factor) on  the constrained line.  
 
Clear as mud?  Hope this  helps.  
 
I'm leaving here in about five minutes to go to an appt with  Holly, but will be back in on Monday.  
 
Regards,
 
Brett

Subject: RE: Question
Brett--
we're  being deployed down (DBES) for more than what our bid states.  In
other  words, we had a DBES Bid in for $-5 and we're getting deployed to  dec
generation and the MCP is $28.  The kicker is the ""category"" of DBES  in
which we're being deployed.  I just got off the phone with Mark  Paterson &
he's indicated that if you are deployed to provide DBES in  ""category"" 2
through 4, then that DBES Deployment was given--unit specific--  OUTSIDE THE
BID STACK (he said it was because we were CAUSING  congestion).
My concern is that our bids are instructed by our  customer.  The customer
is wondering why we're being deployed above our  bid.  Also of concern is
that, according to Mark, that these  DBES's--categories 2 through 4 are
treated and settled as OOM's--largely a  different settlement than DBES.
Add to that that the ""category"" treatment  relative to settlement (or even
being mentioned, for that matter) is NOT in  the protocols--per Mark.
He's just sent me a one-page explanation of this  process so I need to
review it but have you heard of  this?

I talked with Hans at the Autohaus and he relayed that the car was in good shape,  but did probably need a valve adjustment,  as you relayed.   Maybe also an oil leak fixed.     Also,   I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing.
The Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars,  the clutch being a common and costly repair. 

The exterior of the car is in fair condition.     Maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out.
I'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car,  but you cant get it done inexpensively.

I am still interested in the car and I would like my wife to be able to take a look at it.     However,   I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until   Sunday.    Maybe we can meet then.   
If our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car,   I would like to have it checked out mechanically (at my cost)  and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish.
I realize the car is not perfect and it is eleven years old,  but it is a large investment.....

We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.    We want to remain that way,  unless the balancing energy market goes haywire.

What changes do you see happening once ERCOT real-time is established? 
I'm a little cornfused (speaking of Platter, have you heard how he's doing?).  Are you going back to Portland before, during or after you've done the ERCOT gig?  Services desk in Houston or Portland? I'm not a smart man.  I'm actually envious of your potential move back to the Pacific NW.  It's cool to have you and Debbie down here and all, but my vote is for a return back to Portland.  The more connections we have up there, the better.  But don't get me wrong - I'm keeping your best interest in mind.  It's all about you!
By the way, we've found a few places that sell MacTarnahan's, and even some Sokol Blosser wine.  Speaking of wine, I am now an official of both white AND red wines.

I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas 
in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his 
decision. 
I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved 
with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However, 
thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect 
other changes would ensue,  once I established this region. 
So.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a 
new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which 
is a huge thing). 
I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service 
Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.     
Anyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to 
digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional 
decision.   
I am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it 
now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside 
of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and 
I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart. 
Well,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again, 
I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet. 
I heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome. 
Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding). 
I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a 
house.   How is your housing in Taylor? 
I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking 
hot here in Texas! 
Anyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!

Hi Stranger...


In answer to your question, Kevin and/or Doug will be doing your review.  When he presents it to you, it will be final barring any changes the two of you may make together or your personal comments.  Once you sign it, it can not be altered.   In answer to the question on your personnel file, you should be able to view it in my presense (hr security policy)  Let me find out how that can be arranged for you.  Nothing should have been added to the file w/o you knowledge eg. counseling forms and such since you would have to sign off on them)  I can request a copy of your most recent employment agreement for you.  We should have it shortly.

Kim,
Havent talked to you for awhile.    Hope everything is going well.
I do have a question about who will be doing my review.     Also,  dont we still have a rating system?     I would like to see my entire review and have the opportunity to sign off on it.   
Also,  is it possible for me to review my personel file?   Is this within company policy?

Lastly,   can you provide to me a copy of my contract?    Mine is packed in a box somewhere due to the move.

Thank you for your time.

"postion for tomorrow","
Greetings:

For tonight,   Frontera is long 85mw's hour ending 2300.    We need to sell this under the Teco Services book.


For tomorrow Frontera needs to sell:

hour ending  4 - 30 mw's
hour ending 5 -30 mw's
Enter a purchase from Frontera (Teco services book) enter the same price as you sold for.
Enter the sale (Teco Services).

I am also selling Frontera 200 mw's for hour ending 7 and 50 mw's hour ending 8.
I am selling this position for $26.04.       I will be short the Imbalance price during this time. 
If you can buy below $26.04 for this time period,  do so and schedule to load  in the South.       

I am long into the North Zone as follows :
he 1-6,    40 mw's
he 23&24,   55mw's

I am long under deal #834600
If prices appear to weaken,  sell these mw's for 1-6 and cut this Ercot Imbalance deal by same.    This deals should be listed under Ercot Asset.


Thanks,
JMF

John -

Sorry I was on the phone and didn't talk......hope that you are doing OK too!!!  I am hanging in there.....

Here is a q&a regarding the cash balance plan.

Will there be changes to the Cash Balance Plan as a result of the Bankruptcy and are the assets safe from creditors?
No changes have been made to the plan to-date. It is a possibility that the Company may have to reconsider the continuance of future accruals for active employees. If this does occur, accrued benefits will be frozen but interest will continue to be credited. 
The Trust holding the Cash Balance Plan assets is not part of the bankruptcy estate and is not subject to the claims of Enron's creditors. 
There is a lot of q&a's posted on www.enron.com which you may find helpful if I am not available to assist!  Let me know if you need anything else......

Save the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.

You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following:
10/25/01
10/26/01

To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.


The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.

This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.

Let me know your feedback.

"RE: What have you decided?","Amy,
I have elected to stay in Houston until at least February.  It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have ""lost"" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself).
There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.    To that end,   Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron's assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert-Smith.
Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.

These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.

This compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities.

Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.
This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the ""back corner.""
The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.

A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.   This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors,  but I will not be any part of it.

I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.    If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.

There are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.

Well,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister Amy.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.
Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.   

Later,
JMF

We are long 50 mw's for 16 hours Saturday and Sunday.    The length is under the Ercot Asset book and the cost is $15.    I am concerned about Sunday morning,  specifically,  hours ending 7-11.   If you could sell  this for a decent price,  it would be a good thing.  The purchase is an interdesk deal,  so it wont show in Enpower Scheduling.
Also,  for hours ending 15-20 on Sunday we are long an additional 100 mw's at $16.31.   The purchase is under deal #873330 from City of Austin.  The temps are supposed to be warm and it should be muggy on Sunday ahead of the cold front.    This is scheduled to the North Zone under Enpower 873332.  Either leave alone or sell under the Ercot Asset book.

For Monday,  we are long 50 mw's onpeak under another interdesk deal.   The length cannot be seen in Enpower scheduling.      This deal is under Ercot Asset and has been scheduled to load (north) under deal #873255.   Also,  we have another 100 mw's from COA (see Enpower #873330) for he 15-20.     
This is scheduled to north zone under enpower #873332.


Dont forget that the night crew will report to the new building Sunday evening.   The phones are to be inactivated here at 5:30 pm Sunday.

"RE: ercot questions 7-4-01","Chris,
Good questions:
1. You are fine using Ercot System as the delivery opint until the Ercot ISO opens on July 20th.    Subsequent to that, we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as West, North or South Zone.       If we wish to schedule mw's across a path,  ie South to North,  we will need to create an Ercot transmission deal to link south>north.     We do not actually do an Ercot Oasis, etc, to buy this transmission,  rather,  this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally.
Risk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us.  I will let you know what it is called.

2.  The positions that we manage for Frontera/Teco Services should not be reflected in the P&L sheet, as we had been doing.
My fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with Settlements & Risk Mgmt.    We are to keep these deals in the Services P&L sheet,  as Real Time has done for MDEA.     
The location for this spreadsheet is:

M:Eservices/applications/services

We will request access to this tool for everyone.

Thanks,
JMF

Subject: ercot questions 7-4-01


Attached are a few questions Steve and I have talked about.

1)  What do we need to be showing as the delivery point on our Ercot trades (i.e. Ercot system border only?  the various zones ""West 2001""  ""South 2001, ""North 2001""?  split delivery point b/w the buy and sale piece ""i.e CPBS border on the buy form San Antonio and HLP border on the sale to RHLP?

2)  What acronynm do we need to put in the P&L for Frontera?  EPMI Teco Services?  or Frontera?  

NOTE:  Steve Olinde wanted me to remind you that he will not be in the office for training tomorrow (Thursday) b/c the Ercot portal will be down.  He will return for training on Monday around 3:30 pm.

"QSE Trade Instructions","

   We have created a quick quide to do QSE trades through the Ercot Portal.    This initial guide should get you started, however,  this is not a comprehensive handout that contemplates every situation.     I am asking you to read the rules and implement a trade using the Portal.    As you have noticed,   our counterparties have already started trading two hours out.       We will be trading paralell until the ISO rolls out for Friday.   This means that you will have to submit the ""traditional"" Ercot Oasis and also submit the QSE trade.    We must monitor to make sure that our counterparties have submitted their matching QSE trades, as well.   Otherwise we will be out of balance with Ercot.


A copy of our QSE quide will be in your inbox.     Make sure that you read/ study it and ASK QUESTIONS.

Looks ok overall but here are a couple of suggestions:

Make price/mgw  an optional field in the deal entry section of eterra.  
2B should be a higher priority. Also, an alternative to 2B is to have a drop-down box within eTerra to display the corresponding name of the counterparty.

Madup,

In reference to Eterra, I have prioritized some enhancements to the system that will improve its usage and accuracy.  When using Eterra, some tasks are difficult to complete and can result in mismatches in the Ercot Portal.  I will identify some of the difficult tasks and I will make some suggestions on enhancements.  
In addition, I realize that we are working with time constraints and limited personnel.

I will categorize the list based on Priority 1, 2 & 3.

Priority 1 - Very important and needs to be completed immediately
Priority 2 - Important and needs to be completed within the next 30 days
Priority 3 - Moderate importance, easy tasks can be completed at programmers convenience.


Priority 1A:

Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Counterparty A in the South Zone and a Sell to Counterparty B in the North Zone.  Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Counterparty A (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot Book and a second trade, a sell from the Hourly Ercot Book to Counterparty B.  I realize that we have a problem with the transmission between the North and South Zones and that is what makes this a difficult enhancement.  

Priority1B:

Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.  The current process is to input a buy from Frontera and a sell to Frontera.  This is not very intuitive and causes some confusion.  Why can't we input a buy from Frontera just as we would with any other trade? It could be as simple as clicking a box to indicate that Frontera (i.e. - EPMI) should be adjusted on the resource side and not EPMI on the obligation side.

Priority1C:

Eterra should not write over any trades that were input manually into the Ercot Portal.
Is there any way that we can make it identify a trade that was input manually into the portal?
When it finds one then it should not overwrite this trade.

Priority2A:

Undo Button - On various occasions, we have sent Bal Day trades to the QSE MOS/Ercot Portal and 
it was not the result that we had expected.  Therefore, the trader has to manually change each of the trades. This can be a very time consuming process.
Is there a way to have an UNDO button (similar to the Excel UNDO key) to retract the trade information from the QSE MOS or Portal?


Priority2B:

Change the short name in <internal counterparty> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)
Reason: It is just difficult to read. I brought this up with Sasha and he said it would be a quick fix, but it is still not done.

Proirity3A:

Please give us a list of the Counterparties and their appropriate QSE names, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
This helps us identify what it will effect in the QSE MOS and Portal (for example, elpasomeren is converted into APX).  
But does ELP or ELPASELECOM convert to APX also?

Priority3B:

Match Flow Period to automatically update the Contract Date.  This is one less step that we need to worry about.



The above mentioned enhancements will allow us to quickly and accurately update the QSE MOS & Ercot Portal. 
In addition, it will allow us to quickly correct the portal if a mistake occurs.

If you need additional clarification on any of these topics, I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this further.
I will be working days on Monday, Nov. 26th - Thursday, Nov 29th.

Thanks,
Joe Capasso

  
PS - Below is an email that outlines my conversation with Sasha on November 3rd.  Unfortunately, none of the ""quick fixes"" have been completed yet.

John,

I met with Sasha today for approx. 3 hours.
We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS.

Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra (the top of the list is the highest priority):

 - Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine (South Zone) and a Sell to FPL (North Zone).
   Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Calpine (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book 
   to FPL (North Zone).  Sasha said he is working on this, but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North.

 - Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.  The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book.
   This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process.  (Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that
   it is a purchase from Frontera.  Essentially, this would increase the EPMI mw's in the Ercot Portal.)

 - Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)

 - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
    So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal.

 - Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date.  One less step that we need to worry about.

I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading ""time is of the essence"" and that we don't have much time to input data.
Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly.
I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes.

I hope this helps.

"RE: WHAT UP","Bobby,
I came really, really close to coming back to Portland.    I was recently asked to help get the Ercot (TEXAS) region off of the ground by organizing,  training and motivating the Real Time group.   I declined initially, as I had previously turned this job down from Portland.    I came to Houston to trade cash.    Bait and Switch.
  Anyway,  I was looking to return to PDX to work in Mid Mkt or Services, wherever I could have an impact (positive impact, jackie).    
Once I expressed to Houston that my bags were packed, more opportunity presented itself;   I am going to get experience in managing our assets in Texas.   We have an agreement with Teco to manage a 480 mw combined cycle facility in South Texas.   We have some other interesting arrangements as well.

I will be working with Doug Gilbert-Smith, who is the term trader in Ercot.    Good, solid technical guy.   These guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this,  I agreed to finish the rest of the year in Houston and get this thing up and running.    Ercot is currently not short nor volatile.    Not much fun yet, we'll see how the pool works.
I am working with Smith and Jeff Miller as well.

For all of its sound, fury and ego's the Houston office is actually disorganized and short on morale.    
My transition could have been handled better by a monkey man.      My gut tells me that if I stay with the company,  I will be moving back to Portland early next year if they will have me.

Let me know when you will be in town and I'll set up some golf and margaritas.   No boat anymore,  I'm bumming a ride with my friends.

Later,
JMF

John,


Please feel free to make any changes to the priorities below. 
I should have covered most of the big items and even thought up a new enhancement (i.e. - UNDO key), but feel free to add to this list.
I have not sent this to Madup Kumar yet, so just delete this message and forward to him.
I hope this isn't too harsh towards Sasha, but I wanted to get the point across (regarding the PS message at the bottom).
I really hope that they can complete these changes. It would make life much easier.

 - Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)

 - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
    So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal.

 - Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date.  One less step that we need to worry about.

I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading ""time is of the essence"" and that we don't have much time to input data.
Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly.
I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes.

I hope this helps.

Subject:	RE: Frontera Proposal for tomorrow

There are two considerations that I can think of.

1)	We need the market clearing prices in Enpower pub code table to accurately book and settle these financial deals.  I have already informed IT of this issue.
2)	If we trade ""financial swaps"" with customers they MUST have a financial contract with ENA.  This is not necessarily a requirement for Frontera because you can effectuate the trade through ERCOT by buying and selling the physical mw involved.

Question:  When you say you should be allocated the imbalance for HE7-11 as outlined below, do you mean Hourly ERCOT?

Rebecca,
For September 28th,  we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.   We bill them $20,  Enpower #794481,  for various hours.
I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals :

he7 - 310 mw's
he8 - 310 
he 9- 240
he10 - 140
he 11 - 60

Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.  (see imbal.  # 794516).       I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day..
This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.

Thanks,
JMF

Ken,
As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.

I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     

The benefit in this swap would be:
hedge against floating price
lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues
avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.



Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   
I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.

Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.


Let me know what you think,

We must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.  
 For example,   when we have availability,    or even ""must sell""  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem. 

They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.

Mark Patterson, our Rep,  called today to ask me if everything was resolved to my satisfaction.    I relayed that I did talk to John Adams last night and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.    This is great,  however,   Mark warned me that we were outside of the tariff because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run.
He relayed that in the event of line meltdown,  etc.  we would be liable.     John Adams also said this last night.   We are officially on notice of potential QSE liability.

In my opinion we need to:
Call Ken Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this ""liability.""
Officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.

Subject:	RE: ASAP please: ERCOT Questions OOMC & OOME

Here are a few additional points:  

I spoke with Ken Saathoff at ERCOT last week (he is the director of technical operations) and he agreed that an OOMC instruction is essentially a ""be ready"" instruction and an additional OOME or another type of unit specific instruction is necessary for the plant to deploy. He is John Adams boss, so there is a disconnect between the two levels.  In addition to Kent, I spoke to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment, or lack thereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlement statement and use that process.  Going forward however, that is not an effective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove your cost structure.

In speaking with Forney a few minutes ago it sounds like he may have convinced John Adams, but I would be happy to call Kent Saathoff if you feel that would help.

Subject:	Ercot Questions OOMC & OOME


Forwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the OOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pay an OOME price component when the plant's output is utilized by ERCOT.  The OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs under Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensation has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Rate value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOMC/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus running the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is located such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QSE to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position should be Reliability Must Run (""RMR"") and be paid at an adequate premium for their support of the system' reliability.

I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinitiating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tomorrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with an ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): ""threat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols"".  Though the Protocols Sections 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service products that it is 'generating capacity available but not energy delivered to the grid', I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Guides' definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Section 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinction between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the position stated by John Forney below. 

Sorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for your group.

Subject:	Ercot Questions



David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money.""



Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment"" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comment.""
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that "" it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME.""
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for ""forcing them to OOME our plant.""

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

Thanks,

Subject:	Regulatory Updates

I received a voice mail from Mike Curry, asking if I was still an Enron Employee and what had happened to the regulatory reports that I used to send.  Here are the answers.  Yes, I am still an Enron employee. As for the reports, I have been negligent in sending then around over the past few weeks.  The meeting schedule has increased at ERCOT and due to the high congestion costs a Congestion Management working group has been formed to address, the move to the full zonal model, auction of TCR products, local congestion issues etc.  I have been asked to chair the working group which has taken more time.  Finally, I have had an ill daughter and they have been running tests to diagnose the cause of the problem, therefore, I have been traveling back and forth to and from Austin on a daily basis.  All of this has cut into the time that I used to write the reports and have tried to contact the parties directly when an issue arose.  However, I understand the need to disseminate the regulatory information and will resume the summaries forthwith.  You should expect to get a summary of the last weeks activities this p.m.

Hey Lloyd,
As you know,  Joe and Steve spent a considerable amount of time here last weekend due to the flood.     I would think that some recognition would be in order.

How about a personal best of $500,  or a gift certificate,  etc.?

Hey John!
I'm glad got through to you and that your settling into Texas life.  I did
not know Brett was at the ISO now.  How long ago did he make the switch? If
you have an email addr. for Brett, I would appreciate touching bases with
him also.

Not sure if you remember me telling you before I left PDX, but Phoenix is my
home town.  I have been loving it!  And the family really likes it here too.
Went javalina hunting with my son for the first time back in Feb. and love
camping out in the desert.  We did not kill any of those little pigs (did
not even see one), but it was still a blast.

Of course it is hot as hell here too.  Not a lot of humidity, which is a
life saver, but still keeps a fellow inside were the AC is working.  From
October to May, the weather is great, and that's when we do most of our out
door stuff.  My son is 12 years old now and already as tall as dad.  Man!
Does that ever make a fellow realize he is getting ""old.""  If I'm ever in
Houston John, I'll look you up.  I usually bring my wife (Joy) along on
business trips, so maybe we could meet you for one of those famous Texas
steaks one evening?

Take care John and may God continue to bless you!

Mark,
Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was
wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover
at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by
awaiting instruction.

Has there been any progress in this subject?

How is business?   Things not as fun here as PDX.
I am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate:    1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet.    It has 64k and the interior is flawless.
The exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips,  etc in the front.    The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well.
The guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car.     It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop.

Heres the kicker:   the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.     I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.         It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.   The car drives great.

Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?   The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.    Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?   The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.   The retail is supposedly $33k.
What am I missing here?

Thanks,

"Let's talk","Frank,
I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.     Although you mentioned that  the $1,800  (the amount in my account) is a small sum,  I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm,   given to performance of the suggestions provided previously.   
I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time;    I dont expect this.      However,   I do expect some consistent contact from a broker  who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.      My view will be that the more success we have,  the more money I will be willing to invest.

I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you  and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities.
I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.    I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.

I will not use your suggestions to trade at  discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship.   


I look forward to hearing from you.

Call Ken Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this ""liability.""

Subject:	RE: ASAP please: ERCOT Questions OOMC & OOME

Here are a few additional points:  

I spoke with Ken Saathoff at ERCOT last week (he is the director of technical operations) and he agreed that an OOMC instruction is essentially a ""be ready"" instruction and an additional OOME or another type of unit specific instruction is necessary for the plant to deploy. He is John Adams boss, so there is a disconnect between the two levels.  In addition to Kent, I spoke to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment, or lack thereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlement statement and use that process.  Going forward however, that is not an effective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove your cost structure.

In speaking with Forney a few minutes ago it sounds like he may have convinced John Adams, but I would be happy to call Kent Saathoff if you feel that would help.

Subject:	Ercot Questions OOMC & OOME


Forwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the OOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pay an OOME price component when the plant's output is utilized by ERCOT.  The OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs under Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensation has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Rate value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOMC/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus running the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is located such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QSE to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position should be Reliability Must Run (""RMR"") and be paid at an adequate premium for their support of the system' reliability.

I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinitiating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tomorrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with an ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): ""threat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols"".  Though the Protocols Sections 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service products that it is 'generating capacity available but not energy delivered to the grid', I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Guides' definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Section 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinction between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the position stated by John Forney below. 

Sorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for your group.

Subject:	Ercot Questions



David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money.""



Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment"" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comment.""
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that "" it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME.""
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for ""forcing them to OOME our plant.""

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

Thanks,


JForney

We were down balanced in excess of what we were willing to pay,  as indicated by our bidding structure.   It seems that their software is not recognizing our bids.
Our Ercot Rep, Mark Patterson is looking into this.   
We will dispute down balancing bills for the labor day weekend,  as this problem persisted every day.

Mark/ Pat,

Please see the attached file.

It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.

In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
This brings up two questions.

First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?

Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?

Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.

Sincerely,
Joe Capassso
Enron Power Marketing Inc.

Thanks for getting back to me - I can certainly understand why you made this decision and I really hope that it works out!  I would love to have you back in Portland but you need to do what is best for you and Deb.  

Sounds like you will have a busy year trying to turns things around - but I know that you can definitely make a difference once you put your mind to it.  Also, the training piece of it sounds great too - what a great way to learn and not necessarily have the book responsibility right off.....

Subject:	RE: What have you decided?

Amy,
I have elected to stay in Houston until at least February.  It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have ""lost"" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself).
There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.    To that end,   Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron's assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert-Smith.
Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.

These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.

This compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities.

Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.
This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the ""back corner.""
The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.

A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.   This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors,  but I will not be any part of it.

I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.    If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.

There are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.

Well,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister Amy.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.
Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.   

Later,
JMF

How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc.
No problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up.
You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.     You will see Ercot S 8-22  and N 8-22.   You will need to add these and every other hour listed.

John,

I wanted to clarify my e-mail I sent from work I don't think I was specific
enough.

1.  On the day ahead position that hourly would manage, lets say it is in
the short term ercot book.  In ettera if you go to that book you will not
find that trade.  So the only way to adjust it is to go and do it in the
portal.

2.  Also if you have a day ahead position and we manage it hourly,if we were
to adjust it for balday, for instance if we were long 50mw in the pool and
we sold 25mw balday it would reflect the change.  But if we came back and
did another trade and submitted to xml it would change back to 50mw.

3.  We need to change how we show a buy from frontera.  We now have to buy
from frontera and then sale back to them.  This was a way to fix the problem
short term but it should not be a long term solution.

4.  And ettera is still very time consuming.  It takes anywhere from 5-8
min. to enter a trade for just one hour.

I hope this is more specific.

Frank Busot asked me to give him a summary of who is responsible for what in the trading function at Enron.  The reason is that he wanted to be more comfortable than he is with the separation of EPMI and Services.

Currently, I see:

Jeff King - Long - Term ERCOT
Paul Schivone - Short Term ERCOT
John Forney - Services Trading, EPMI ERCOT Hourly, Services ERCOT Hourly

Correct?

"Real Time Group Expectations","
Greetings - I have attached the most basic expectations for our group.   We have been spending a lot of time balancing the books lately, and the attached will relieve some of this, so we can focus on trading.   I will make sure that we receive balanced books from Day ahead trading/scheduling.
Also,  make an effort to know why we run reports, etc.  so that you can make suggestions to streamline this operation. 

I will provide more documented general procedures and will spend time with each of you on how to handle cuts in Enpower and Lotus Notes.      

We have a good group and we will do well in the new market.    However,  this will take an extra effort from each of us.
If you have questions about any of the expectations,   ask.    That is why we make the list.

Thanks,
JMF

Bart,
que paso,   juaro?    
Jeff passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?   ""Taylor,  home of the fighting beetles,""....  Go beetles!
I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths.
Well,  enough about you,  let's talk about me..............
the Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things were coming together until..........

(Please keep this confidential)
Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group,  his decision being final,  no negotiations.  (thanks for your understanding, bunghole).
I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision.
I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However,   thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect other changes would ensue,  once I established this region.

So.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which is a huge thing).
I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.     
Anyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision.   
I am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart.

Well,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again,   I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet.
I heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome.    Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding).
I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house.   How is your housing in Taylor?
I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking hot here in Texas!

Anyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!

We havent received the necessary information,  so no choice has been made yet.

We would like to switch these accounts. We'd like the switch to be effective September 4th, but our top priority is to make sure they get into the pilot program. (I realize that it may be impossible to decide exactly when the switch will become effective)

Please confirm that we can get this done.

Preston,

I talked with Rebecca this evening.  Here is the summary:

- We cannot be ready to do business with CP&L or TNP by August.
- She has a relatively high degree of confidence (85%) that we could be ready with HL&P and TXU, here are the main issues:
She would like the rate schedule (and account number if available) of each account we would like to get into the pilot to confirm that there is room.  She indicated that she had understood that all rate schedules are filled and that the website may be in error.
There are outstanding issues on how interzonal congestion and gross receipts tax will be billed.
Invoicing will likely be manual with additional costs associated.  There may also be other manual workarounds necessary at additional expense.
The Pilot Agreements will need to be completed (per Gloria Ogenyi).

Please send her item #1 asap so that she can confirm that there is room for these accounts.  Once this is done we can put on the full court press for August.

Thanks,
Jeff

"Resumes","
Allan,
I havent heard anything from Anadarko,  but I am talking to several other players.    There is a possibility that I will be relocating to Tampa Florida or possibly back to Oregon.	Thanks for passing my info along and inquiring as to my situation.      We still need to make time for that beer.   I get out of work very early each day, as our trading opportunities are severely limited.

I would like to pass on a couple of resumes from two of my friends that were released at Enron.      My friend has some solid accounting background and his wife worked in HR as a specialist.    They are a Woodlands couple and would like to avoid that crappy drive to Houston.

I know that Anadarko is probably being swamped with resumes,  but I didnt know if your department had specific needs that may match what Jim has to offer.  This guy is extremely detail oriented and capable.
If you could review and pass these on,  I would really appreciate it:  this is my golfing buddy and he cant play anymore if he isnt working.  Just kidding

Tell me what is happening with you.  ( I still dont miss Koch,  but I miss working 8 - 9 hour days!).  I think that Mike Eiben has been long gone from Enron.   I had been looking for him before the layoffs,  but hadnt been able to find him in the voice directory, etc.

Call or e-mail and I will meet at Buffalo Wild Wings or somewhere else.  We dont have to talk about work.....no,   lets not talk about work!

Thanks,

JMF

"Frontera disputes","

We are collecting information to dispute Ercot's OOMC calculation.    OOMC has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning Replacement reserves mkt.
Ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC.   I think that this goes back to Sept 14th.

Also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for.    Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby.   So,  for the times that we were asked to run,  Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation.

How far can we go back in a dispute?  I thought we were somewhat limited.

"Frontera position for tomorrow","

I have sold Frontera a financial swap for $28.50 for hours ending 7-12.    The first 3 hours are for size (300 mw's).  
I would buy hours 7-9 tomorrow for up to $20.      I could buy up to the 300 mw's.     Schedule this to load in the North.
I could also use 200 mw's for he 10 and 150 mw's for he 11.

Calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 7-9.

If you have questions,  please give me a call,  as this is a very important issue.

Words of advice:

Dont go into the market with a $20 bid for 300 mw's.   Quietly accumulate these mw's if possible.     Do not tip your hand on this deal,  as that would contribute to spiking RT prices.

Thanks,

Subject:	Couple of Questions

John, 

Good morning.  Just wanted to pose a couple of questions that I was thinking about this weekend.  First, does the shift begin at 5:30or 6?  I know you had mentioned that you may change the hours.  If you know, what is the general consensus for those  individuals working night and days, as far as parking is concerned. Lastly, please forward me the September schedule when you get a chance?   

Thanks John, I'm looking forward to coming up!!!  George

Subject:	THE TECO MEMO--BULLET POINT 4

John,

This is what I've come up with so far on Market Opportunity & Operational plan.  I think this would be a good place to also include Mexico opportunities.  Please add/edit as you wish.


Thinking out loud:

Operational Plan and Market Opportunities going forward:

Off-Peak Energy (including Weekends & Holidays):		To date, this market has been less-attractive-EPMI and TECO need to work together to ensure Frontera is gaining maximum value.  This should begin as soon as possible.  Examination of  NOT running the plant during  [Forney, John M.]  the weekend and other offpeak hours  is paramount.

ERCOT Market:	EPMI personnel have a wealth of experience in working in ISO Markets.  It is our feeling that the ERCOT market, which opens July 20, will provide [Forney, John M.]  significant   opportunity in maximizing value for Frontera.   [Forney, John M.]      Opportunity should lie within the Balancing Market [Forney, John M.]  ,   Ancillary Services Market [Forney, John M.]   and the decremental bidding ""market.""  [Forney, John M.]  Immediate plans will include submitting decremental bids into the ISO.   We will be responsible for responding to the ISO instructions by decreasing the output from Frontera during key hours.

"Frontera OOM for 8/30","

Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.   We had  submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium  because the unit was offline.   In the Resource Plan,  we can  attach a premium for OOM up or down.   In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was ""unavailable and offline"".  
   The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.

Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.   We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.   Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13,  to control congestion.   They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400.
I called Mark Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep.,  and I explained the situation.   I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.   I also wanted to know how this would settle.

His reply is as follows:

Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant,  that changed our status from unavailable to available.
Since we had an implied low premium (zero)  on our plant,  we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon.
We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.  The mcp was low all day ( mid teens)  yesterday.
If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs,  we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.



We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available  with a $50 premium.    This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs.   
The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.   Please review this to understand why this applies.



This was a very educational process.    We think that in revising our Resource Plan ""on the fly""  we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.


Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented:

If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.    Say the unit is NOT available.

If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums:

$50 premium for OOM up.
$10 premium for OOM down.

These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order.
If we are OOM'd up,   the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.

If we are OOM'd down,  then we should be paid the mcp + premium.

Please call me if you have questions,

Duong,

Can I get a change in Enpower?   We have done this type thing on the West desk:

For every counterparty ""Ercot Imbalance"" ,   I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to ""off""  automatically.     When this manual process does not get done,  we have settlement problems.

What do you think?

Save the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.

You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following:
10/25/01
10/26/01

To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.


The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.

This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.

Let me know your feedback.

Subject:	eterra

John,

I wanted to clarify my e-mail I sent from work I don't think I was specific
enough.

1.  On the day ahead position that hourly would manage, lets say it is in
the short term ercot book.  In ettera if you go to that book you will not
find that trade.  So the only way to adjust it is to go and do it in the
portal.

2.  Also if you have a day ahead position and we manage it hourly,if we were
to adjust it for balday, for instance if we were long 50mw in the pool and
we sold 25mw balday it would reflect the change.  But if we came back and
did another trade and submitted to xml it would change back to 50mw.

3.  We need to change how we show a buy from frontera.  We now have to buy
from frontera and then sale back to them.  This was a way to fix the problem
short term but it should not be a long term solution.

4.  And ettera is still very time consuming.  It takes anywhere from 5-8
min. to enter a trade for just one hour.

I hope this is more specific.

Lloyd,
Would it make sense to press our EES/West Point guys to a decision?    We should express that we want to hire internally,  however,  we do have external candidates that we are considering.

The Reliant guy,  Ryan Thomas,   was a good interview and seems to have something positive to prove.   I believe that HR has some specific questions that they wish us to ask regarding his employment at Reliant.

Also,   EES is petitioning Kevin for me to let Watt's go right now.    I have indicated to Terry Donavan that mid July would be preferable due to our being already short staffed.    

Let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance.    I will be out of the office for half day Friday and all day on Monday.

Thanks!

"positions for Monday","

Due to the slowdown in trading,   I will be concentrating on leaving positions for RT to trade around.    
These will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility.    This will make more sense,  once you inherit the position.

The following positions need to be watched for monday:

1.     We are short to Mirant (on behalf of Frontera) for hour ending 6 only.     We need to buy 50 mw's and schedule this with Mirant Real Time.     
They are expecting and have agreed to this trade.   This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis.

If you are working Sunday night,   check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade.   It is very common that they get a bad ""handoff"" and are unaware of this transaction.     Give them plenty of time to work this out.

We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X  and a sale to Mirant.    In Enpower,  buy from X and sell to Frontera (under the Teco Services book).   Enter this as a flat transaction,  ie buy for $20 and sell to Frontera for $20.


2.    The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw's for offpeak Monday at $11.25.    Sell this or leave to the pool, as necessary.     I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10/16-19.     



I think that Saturday morning will come in strong, as we are getting some cooler weather.    I think also that some larger units are coming off line,  which will put upward pressure on the offpeak.


Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want.       Next day onpeak is trading for $20.5,  offpeak is trading $11.25.     
Where is the value???   Lets  trade it up!

Thanks for the info for the additional load.      As I understand it,  we now have approximately 20 mw's in the South.  This is great!!
Each day I review balancing energy prices vs.  daily prices and the choice is extremely simple:    We allow the pool to fill this load.

I would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further.     There is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage.

Do we need to discuss this further?   I just want to be on the same page.

"Frontera Ideas","

Tom,
Frontera did agree to do the financial swap for tomorrow.   I am really excited about getting this product off.    I guess we need to follow up with the swap papers now.

Here are some things that we proposed to Frontera:

September 20th - I suggested selling October at $24.75.   This was a 10.72 heat rate.       I had to take off for an Austin trip and Clint took over for me in trying to get them to transact.
Power moved down,  but so did gas,   The heat rate was the same,  but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $24.75.    Power reached low of 10 heat rate for October recently - it is currently 10.2.

I suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 10.5  heat rate.   The dailies have been now liquidating as low as 8.9 hr.


August (late) - Clint proposed selling 12.7  heat rate in September .   They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market.  This didnt work out.

On a daily basis,  Frontera has a problem making timely decisions.   For example,   I give them gas prices and daily prices.   They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day.   I tell them that I will bookout my option.   
They call back later and say that they would like to run.     Bids are now $2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible.

On Tuesday,   I suggested selling a $24 call option for October for  a $1.25 premium.    This would have at least brought in $23,000.   They werent interested in this idea.

I communicate my feelings on the market very early.   If they could react quicker,   I would smack the first bids that showed their faces,  including EOL.
I could have taken out 200mw's in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks.


Clint has some other instances that he would like to relay.   He will be sending another e-mail.


This relationship,  although not initially profitable,  has allowed us to develop other relationships that would not have otherwise been possible.   I dont really want to lose the job.   We are providing some outstanding support, in my opinion.

The thing that weakens our case is that Ercot is not providing the appropriate settlement details that would help illustrate our case on the OOM payments.
The settlements extract,  as I learned on my trip,  is key to explainnig this value.     The OOM value itself is well over $200k.

Good luck!

Please note that when you start/stop a schedule to or from the following control areas,  the listed static scheduling fee applies.   

Reliant/HLP  - $49
TNMP  - $55
COA   -  $40
BEC  - $25


For example,  if we schedule for one hour from BEC>COA,   the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat  $65.      Also applicable would be the per mw  line losses and the wheeling fee of $.22  .    
Please account for all such charges in the P&L report.

Ercot  may just be testing our responsiveness,  or ,  they may have a specific question about the mock market that is taking place now.      Any questions that cannot be immediately answered should be relayed to Smith Day or myself.

We will be installing hardware soon that will receive generation instructions from the ISO.   For RT purposes,  this will be used for billing purposes.    Any action ordered by the ISO will also be communicated to the Control room simultaneously.   They will be responsible for the actual dispatch of the unit.

We will be announcing a meeting soon to describe our new Ercot world and to exchange ideas.    I would also like to have a session with the group to explain the logic behind the reports we are responsible and to explain how the whole floor works.    This can be a broad overview,  or we can drill down to specifics at your request.

  

Thanks for your attention.

"RE: Deployments","Frank.  
The ancillary services market for non-spinning has been horrible.   Non- spinnning for today is,  at most,   90 cents/mw for hours 14-18.  The remaining hours are worth zero.
The down regulation and up regulation markets are lucrative  at as much as $11.99/mw ,  but we are not certified for this service.     As I understand it,  there is some work necessary on the plant to allow us to sell up/down regulation and replacement.  GE personel were to travel to the plant and do some work,  but in light of world events,  I do not know if they have arrived.
Once the upgrades are complete,   we need to restart the certification process with Ercot.

If we sell non-spin for .90,  we would need to withhold this power from the market.   We have been selling,  on a Real Time basis,   as much power as we can get out the door.   We have not been selling offpeak and we are starting schedules,  typically at hour 10 through 22 for a sales price of $24.

That is the latest.   We are currently looking at making sales in October.  The heat rate is around 10.7

Please check out the following.     The agreement I reached with Ercot/Frontera yesterday is as follows:
When we receive an OOMC,  we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online.
If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME,  then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down.   We dont actually want to do this,  as there are some expensive start charges associated with this.

We will discuss further in the meeting.

Subject:	Ercot Questions



David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money.""



Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment"" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comment.""
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that "" it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME.""
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for ""forcing them to OOME our plant.""

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

Thanks,


JForney

"Major Problems with OOMC","

I need some support on this:
For the last two weeks,  Ercot has been giving us OOMC orders.     They have told us to run the plant, without question.     We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run.    To a man,   the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run, they want the power.     
I have launched three e-mails (requesting clarification)  to Mark Patterson,  starting weeks ago on this issue.    Yesterday,   I caught Mark by phone at 5:30pm.

Mark consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC'd and we should run,  but they are not going to pay us the hr calc.
They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power.     This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance, instead of the heat rate calc.       We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $5.      It costs us $26 to generate power.

Mark said "" dont worry, at worst case you can file for reimbursement.""     Mark also said that we will get paid for the capacity. But what???

It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue.     They want to penalize us if we dont run,  and if we do ,  we will lose money.
We then file to get a break-even rebate.  They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component.

I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples, as requested by Ercot.

I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions.   I  do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore.  
We will be more vocal in this meeting.    If no resolution is reached,  I vote for ignoring their OOM instructions.
I need a ruling on whether they can force us to lose money.  

Thanks,

JForney

Andrea,  

Please see the attached spreadsheet for Friday.   All of the deals listed  have been moved to Teco Services for this day only.      We entered a buy (which is an estimate of the cost of gen)  and the appropriate sales.  We need to talk about how this gets reconciled.    I would like to know the detail of this transaction.    
I know that not everything has been discussed with this account,  so I would like to discuss it.

I am positive that I need to change all deals for over the weekend.   We had some length for this customer that was sold hourly.     I assume that everything from now on will be entered under Teco Services for this account.
Can you think of any exceptions?  

I will let you know when the weekend is complete.

Will you please check on why this employee is not getting the $5 co-pay
and is being charged $25/month?  He said he signed up through the

Subject:	OOMC FOR FRONTERA

I notified Coleen at the ISO that Frontera will be off line starting at 2300 hours tonight for economic reasons.  I also told Coleen the plant will be available if needed.

The ISO sent OOMC of 164 mws for 2400 9-25-01 through 2400 9-26-01.  I called the ISO and spoke with Jay about the OOMC.  Jay told me that he will probably hold the plant at minimum load tonight.  He wasn't sure what loading the plant would be at during the day.

I notified GENCO ( John Pappa ) of the OOMC and told him that I will advise him of the output level once the ISO lets me know.

I called ( Ken ) and told him about the OOMC.  I told Ken the plant will have to run all day tommorrow.

At 1945, the ISO revised the OOMC for the 26th.  The new OOMC is 184 mws/24hr.

"EES Proposal","

Narsimha -
Can we get together to discuss how best to serve your retail load?     I think this simple process has been complicated by the number of players involved.
We will give you any structure that you need and provide transparency as to how we do what we do.   What more is there?

I have heard that this could start as early as September,  but we are still a bit short on detail.     If we started in September,  I would envision passing local charges, congestion,   etc to EES.    We would schedule your hedges,  your load and cover any remaining balance (or not) with respect to load zone.
We would provide scheduling services,  settlements and   24 hour coverage to handle any  contingencies that might occur.

I look forward to working with you on this issue. 

Give me a call when you get a chance.

Thanks,
JForney

"The latest available","
For all that have missed the floor meeting,   we have been downgraded to ""junk"" status,  ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price.
A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.     Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least.   
If bankruptcy is filed,  payroll should be covered.
Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.   There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.

Currently,  we are not trading.    We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.    Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.    We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.

More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.     Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.   We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.

Thane,

There must be some miscommunication.  I just talked with John and he

knows that an OOME instruction is necessary to get energy from OOMC

capacity.  It is not required by the protocols to bid in to balancing

market as is Replacement.  That causes us some operation problems and we

may ask for that requirement to be applied to OOMC as well.

Subject: OOMC/OOME

Importance: High


I have a follow up question on our discussion at the TAC meeting last

week.  As we discussed, an OOMC instruction for hours 0-24 at 50MW would

for example require a unit to be prepared to provide the 50MW, but not

to actually provide the energy.  Another unit specific instruction or

OOME would be required for the unit to actually run at 50MW.

As recent as this morning, we were told that ERCOT would provide us an

OOME instruction when they want us to run after an OOMC instruction.

However, they also said that we were operating outside the protocols due

to John Adams' interpretation that when we receive an OOMC for a certain

time period at a certain level we should be generating.

We need immediate clarification on this issue.

Mark, 
Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC 
capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual 
OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO. 
He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 
9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th. 
We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand 
the payment for the energy portion of the exercise. 
However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity 
portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement 
reserve market. 
The replacement reserve prices have been zero. 
Could you provide some help on this? 
Thanks,

"Duke Purchase for tomorrow, April 26th","I have purchased from Duke   100 mw's at $51  for flow into Entergy (see deal#591863) .       Duke is  transmitting this power through their capacity through SOCO.     In the event of TLR's,   we have the option of cutting this supply,   without booking out (deal was negotiated with Amar).
If this happens,  of course  you need to fill the demand side and cut the purchase from Duke in enpower - see deal no. above.   The purchases  go in the ST SPP book.

Once again,  If RT has to intervene,  please make sure that Enpower is balanced with respect to ST SPP.     Also,   let me know immediately if there are problems with this or any other schedule that I have.

You guys are doing a good job.

"Frontera Proposal for tomorrow","

Ken,
As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.

I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     

The benefit in this swap would be:
hedge against floating price
lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues
avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.



Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   
I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.

Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.


Let me know what you think,

1)  ERCOT conference call

John Adams with ERCOT called at 3:30 pm on Saturday afternoon to say Enron responded to instructions inappropriately during Friday's frequency control test while under single control area operations.    Friday's instruction from Ercot was for Enron to deploy balancing energy while Enron did not deploy balancing energy as per the instruction because no balancing bid was in place.  Enron  was not the only QSE to be confused by these instructions.  

Adams later clarified the definitions of the operation constraints
OC1	worst level constraint

OC0	commercially significant constraints CSC) approved once per year by ERCOT

OC2	entered manually through operator entry

OC3	populated by DC power flows (FST); designed to include all generators in the constraint equation and adjust for load flows.

John encouraged all to understand the distinctions between all these constraints before actively participating in the balancing energy market.

2)  schedule mismatch

Enron had a schedule mismatch for Sunday's (7-8-01) schedules.  The mismatch was with a 5 mw obligation to BTU for HE 7 to HE 22.  Sunny and I reviewed this situation on Saturday evening.  Sunny said he submitted this schedule several times on Saturday and early Sunday morning.  The off peak hours matched fine.

"Frontera ACE Issue for tomorrow","

We have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours 7-11 for $20.   They sold a 340 mw schedule for the onpeak tomorrow.
They will be ramping up starting hour ending 7 for the following:

He7,8  - 30mw's
He 9  - 100
HE 10 - 200
HE 11 -280

So,  basically,  they will be dragging significantly for these hours.    We sold this imbalance to them for $20 and we will take the floating price.
The Resource Plan will only show 340 mw's onpeak.     

Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue.    Just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above.

In the future,   I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group.
I am a Commercial Director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge.

I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was.   We werent able to secure a commitment from customers,  but I was confident that our spots could be filled internally ( with our group members).    I am sure that the overall headcount for this trip
did not change,  rather the allocation to each group was changed.

My goal is not to give you a hard time - I dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything.
But I do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank,  profitability and that I have been here 8 years.
I try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff.

Thanks for your reply.
Here's what I have learned from our conversation:
Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were ""captured"" by Don and Juan's group?
I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.

Don and Juan have invited my employee,  Steve Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.

I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?

Subject:	Possible Scam

Not sure if you knew of this or not...

DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809

This one is being distributed all over the U.S.  This
is pretty scary - especially given the way they try to
get you to call.  Be sure you read this and pass it on
to all your friends, family and business associates so
they don't get scammed!!  THIS IS A MAJOR SCAM.

Don't respond to E-Mails, phone calls or web pages
which tell you to call an ""809"" phone number.  This is
a very important issue of Scam Busters because it
alerts you to a scam that is spreading ""extremely""
quickly.  This can easily cost you $24,100.00 or more
and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it.
We'd like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to
our attention.  This scam has also been identified by
the National Fraud Information Center and is costing
victims a lot of money.

There are lots of different permutations of this scam,
but HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. You will receive a message on
your answering machine, voice mail, etc, asking you to
call a number beginning with the area code 809.  The
reasons you are asked to call varies.  It can be to
receive information about a family member who has been
ill, to tell you someone you know has been arrested,
died, to let you know you have won a wonderful prize,
etc.  In each case, you are told to call the 809
number right away.  Since there are so many new area
codes these days, people unknowingly return these
calls.  If you call from the U.S., you will apparently
be charged $2,425.00 per minute.  Or. you will get a
long recorded message.  The point is, they will try to
keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase
the charges.  Unfortunately, when you get your phone
bill, you'll often be charged more than $24,100.00.

WHY IT WORKS:  The 809 area code number is located in
the British Virgin Islands (The Bahamas).  The 809
area code can be used as a ""pay-per-call"" number,
similar to 900 numbers in the U.S.  Since 809 is not
in the U.S., it is not covered by U.S. regulations of
900 numbers, which require that you be notified and
warned of charges and rates involved when you call a
""pay-per-call"" number.  There is also no requirement
that the company provide a time period during which
you may terminate the call without being charged.
Furthermore, whereas many U.S. phones have 900 number
blocking to avoid these kinds of charges.  900 number
blocking will not prevent calls to the 809 area code.
We recommend that no matter how you get the message,
if you are asked to call a number with an 809 area
code that you don't recognize and/orinvestigate
further and just disregard the message.  Be wary of
E-Mail or calls asking you to call an 809 area code
num! ber.  It's important to prevent becoming a victim
of this scam since trying to fight the charges
afterwards can become a real nightmare.

That's because you did actually make the call.  If you
complain, both your local phone company and your long
distance carrier will not want to get involved.  They
will most likely tell you that they are simply
providing the billing for the foreign company.  You'll
end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they
have done nothing wrong.  Please forward this entire
message to all of your friends, family and colleagues
to help them become aware of this scam

Thane,

There must be some miscommunication.  I just talked with John and he

knows that an OOME instruction is necessary to get energy from OOMC

capacity.  It is not required by the protocols to bid in to balancing

market as is Replacement.  That causes us some operation problems and we

may ask for that requirement to be applied to OOMC as well.

Subject: OOMC/OOME

Importance: High


I have a follow up question on our discussion at the TAC meeting last

week.  As we discussed, an OOMC instruction for hours 0-24 at 50MW would

for example require a unit to be prepared to provide the 50MW, but not

to actually provide the energy.  Another unit specific instruction or

OOME would be required for the unit to actually run at 50MW.

As recent as this morning, we were told that ERCOT would provide us an

OOME instruction when they want us to run after an OOMC instruction.

However, they also said that we were operating outside the protocols due

to John Adams' interpretation that when we receive an OOMC for a certain

time period at a certain level we should be generating.

We need immediate clarification on this issue.

Subject:	Looking for Employment

Mr. Forney,

Thanks or giving me a moment to speak to you today.  I am looking for a
position at Enron for the near future.  I have been serving as a day ahead
and hourly trader as well as a scheduler for BTU.  Other tasks have included
designing automated spreadsheets to assist with trading and settlements and
various IT work.  I am looking for something high paced, something that will
keep me busy throughout the day.  I am quick with analytics and have taken
courses in Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics, and Econometrics to
add to my BS in Economics.

I am looking to move to Houston for personal reasons, to be with the girl I
am planning on marrying next year.  I like it here at BTU, but staying in
this area is not presently an option.  Please take a look, ask me any
question you can think of, and feel free to contact me at any time.  I will
be in Houston Saturday through Wednesday visiting my girlfriend who is a
consultant for Sun Gard, working at Reliant.

Thank you again,

Brandon Whittle

"City of Bryan for May 29th,  hour ending 19","
Chris,  I think we already discussed this issue but let me summarize what I think happened:

we were parking 50 mw's with COB.   We sold 50 to Reliant/HLP,  but the transmission got cut.    3 mw's flowed on Oasis 9337 to Reliant.    We show in the system that we are purchasing 50 mw's from COB and selling them 47.
So,  I dont think that we needed to bookout 3 mw's with HLP.    They received 3 mw's from City of Bryan on deal #625291. 
You entered a bookout purchase on deal #625352.

Oasis also  shows that 3 mw's flowed on #9337.   So once again,  we have an extra purchase from HLP that we didnt need.
Did you negotiate this with HLP?   
Is this what happened?

I'll talk to you about this tonight.

Thanks,  MW

Thanks for spending time with me yesterday.   I have spoken with Tom May concerning what my status was.   I mentioned that my preference would be to return to Portland,  however,  I would be considering other options within the company for one week.

"UPDATE","Thanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help Doug Gilbert-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.

I have notified Presto that I would be joining Doug in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in Houston,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in Houston may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.

I am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.       You certainly are under no obligation to do this,   but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company,   possibly on the retail side.       

Thanks for your time,

Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were ""captured"" by Don and Juan's group?
I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.

"Enpower Deal Entry","

Alex,
You have been somehow  entering deals under South America - Brazil region,   rather than South 2001.   Risk has been having a problem with this.
This has also affected the Brazil trading desk.      
Double check your deal entry desks and zones.     I intended to mention this last week and I forgot.   It came up again today,  per risk.

Also,
on the hour ending 6 deal today;   you should have entered a sale to Frontera in Enpower, rather than Mirant.
This is a bit confusing,  but here goes:

Frontera had sold Mirant this option,  not Enron.     Frontera tells me daily what Mirant is calling for.   I replace this power,  or Frontera generates the schedule.
If I (or you)  replace,  then we do enter a schedule of a sale to Mirant in the Portal.   But,  we dont sell to Mirant in Enpower, as this is not our deal.

Instead,   the sale goes to Frontera.   They pay us to reimburse us for buying LCRA on their behalf. 

Does that help?

Subject:	Ercot Portal Mismatch



  John,

I had a mismatch problem in the portal that I think you and the group should know about.

I completed a trade with Calpine tonight (09/08/01), I purchased 50mw for HE 3 & 4 and 
quickly input it in the portal.  At approximately 1:50am, Calpine still did not have their side 
of the trade input, so I gave Scott at Calpine a quick call.  He was in the process
of inputting the information in the system and I could see the Calpine entries turning from 
red to black.

All of the entries matched up correctly except for the 300 interval and this is where
the problem begins.  Scott confirmed the trade verbally and I, also, had the same information
(i.e. - 50mw, South Zone, etc...).  Even though, everything was the same in both portals, it remained red
and unmatched.  

Scott called Jake at Ercot and confirmed that both sides of the trade were correct, 
but he did not know why it did not match up.  He said it was a system problem and 
that he would have it looked at on Monday.

Jake at Ercot mentioned that we should contact our customer service rep. to make sure that we 
are not incurred any penalties.

Please keep an eye on this as it could become a chronic problem.
I have documented this in the QSE Mismatch log book.

I hope this has been helpful.

Joe Capasso

"RE: Austin Energy - Sand Hills","The instantaneous supply in the form of ancillary services was supposed to be provided to us  by COA.   The contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply, or how we would schedule intraday power.  
COA wants us to ""split the meter"" at the plant,  allowing us to schedule our own 100 mw's ( and assume all liability) and also arrange our own gas agreement.
Otherwise,  they dont want to allow us intraday capability.
The agreement doesnt expire until Nov 3, 2003.

Their would be two gas contracts to consider,  I suppose:  Enron needs to contract for their own supply for this plant and also wants to sell to COA directly.

When do you want to talk?

We need to talk about instantaneous supply and how it is dealt with under your Sand Hills contract. The contract I am working on with Austin really doesn't address this issue and in order for me to include this in the contract we will need to talk. I have a call in also with Lonestar to talk about this as well. I have Janet Wallis helping me address some of these issues. We may want to schedule a meeting to include her also.

"POLICY FOR INTERVIEWING","

From time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for RT trading, scheduling, or other positions.
If you recognize someone from another firm,  or know who they are,  do not discuss their interest in Enron with anyone else.

Recently,  we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with Enron.  Both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here.    Totally unacceptable.     I have to ensure that this information is not coming from  my group, hence this note.

Common sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations.   If you have any feedback on this situation I would like to hear it.   

Thanks for your attention to this very important issue.

Example assumptions:
Market consists entirely of 4 QSEs who have the following schedule-actual variances in a particular hour; A=+50MW; B=+50MW; C=-25MW & D=-25MW.
Market energy price is $100/MWH.

Since money paid by C & D is insufficient to fully reimburse A & B (5000+5000-2500-2500=5000), what happens in the settlement?  Do A & B get proportionally less than they otherwise would have gotten?  Or, is there a banking mechanism that builds up in hours where there are overages and is drawn down in hours where there are shortages (such as example above)?

Ettera issues:


1.  When hourly is asked to manage a day ahead position we cannot adjust the position in ettera and makes it a worthless tool, the position cannot be found.  We have to adjust the day ahead position in the portal directly.

2.  If we have a day ahead position and adjust it hourly it will change back to the original schedule when we submit another schedule.

3.  Frontera is too time consuming and confusing when we have to show a buy from frontera and a sell to frontera when we buy from them.

4.  The whole process takes to long, on average it usually takes 5 minutes to put an hourly schedule in when it only takes a minute when done directly in the portal.


Thats all I got, I hope it helps.

i am still interested in being a part of a leaner trade floor at Enron,  but this proposition is less likely than my leaving.    the creditors and the bankruptcy judge are not that likely to approve good bonuses for performers, in my opinion.

"FRONTERA DOWN BALANCING (DBES)","

We are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent.     Every morning it is especially important that we have a DBES bid input for Frontera.
We should have balancing bids in for all hours,  but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours.
We are required to monitor the Deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to Jerry Watson @ Teco/Frontera.

Frontera is willing to pay a max of $10 to decrease their gen.    This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being ""balanced down.""

We should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down.     If this situation happens,  we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO.
This is an important part of the Services side of our business,  and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.


If anyone has any questions on this, please give me a call as this is very important to all of us.'

Mark/ Pat,

Please see the attached file.

It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.

In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
This brings up two questions.

First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?

Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?

Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.

Sincerely,
Joe Capassso
Enron Power Marketing Inc.

"positions for tomorrow","A reminder,   I am 55 mws long for hours 23 & 24 today.   This has been scheduled into the North Zone.    If you sell make sure that you cut the Enpower deal and make the appropriate entries in the Portal.   Enpwr deal   834600   is the sale to North Zone.


The Ercot Asset desk is long 5 mw's  for the offpeak hours at $9.20.   The  Enpwr deal number is #836534
If you sell hours 1-6,  cut this sale to Ercot Imbal and replace with the appropriate counterparty under Hourly Ercot book.    We will leave


Additionally,   Frontera needs to sell the following:

hour ending 4 - 30 mw's
he 5 - 30 mws
he 6 - 85 mw's
Put these purchases/ sales in the Teco Services book.

I have sold them the power swap where I sell them 100 mw for 7&8 ($25).    I then pay the pool price.    If prices somehow appear that they will be greater than $25 for these hours,  please cover and schedule to the South Zone



The Swap went very well today,  since we had a physical position:

Although the physical may lose $1500,  the financial swap will make $17,000.

Here's how it works:
When you buy balday,   you buy fixed ($30) and sell floating (Ercot Pool)
Today I sold fixed ( $37) and bought floating.     

The floating components cancel and we are left with a $7 margin.


Call if you have questions.

For Monday,   it is necessary that we sell the following for Frontera:

he 4 -30mw's
he 5 - 30 mw's
he 7 - 30 mw's
he 23 - 85 mw's 
he 24 - 85 mw's


Also,   we need  to buy 15 mw's for hour ending 7 to assist with Frontera's ramp.

We are not running the plant this weekend.    The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline.
We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of.
Also,  please make sure that the OOM premiums (up & down) are input as $50 and $40 respectively.

FYI - for OOM up,  we receive a 14.1 heat rate multiplied by the Houston Ship Channel price.   For this weekend assume $2.05.   IF you can make hourly,  bal-day sales in excess of this,  check with Jerry or Ken at Frontera.

Steve Olinde is notifying Ercot that we are coming down this weekend  for economics.   We have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system.


I will be out of town this weekend.   I can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue.

"RE: What is up - any news?","

Stewie:
I agreed to stay through the end of the year (February)  to get this project off of the ground.   What I get in return is the responsibilty of trading around our assets in Texas,  a 500 mw unit,  Frontera,  and a 100 mw heat rate call from the City of Austin.   I have asked that these responsibilities be officially committed to writing.
It is too late in the year for me to move to Portland,  get out and make a contribution for the summer.    These guys are in terrible shape here,  and I am needed.
I report to Lloyd Will,  who is a great guy.    I am working with Doug Gilbert-Smith,  who is the Ercot Term trader.   He has agreed to share some of his knowledge with me and I am spending time with the gen group to learn more about the steel.  I will be working with Miller and Smith (weeeeeelllll?)   
This was the best option for me at this time,  and also for the company. 

I will be leaving the main office in February,  whether it is with Enron or not.   I would prefer to stay with the company,  as my options are worth zero at the moment.
We still want to return to Portland,   but right now I am needed here.   

Thanks for checking.    Let me know when you are coming down,   but dont bring your sweater.    Hope things are going well for you and your group.
I'll give you a call later and tell you what's what.    (hey,  I never used to say  that - you were stereotyping).

Later,

HE3 & HE5 ARE IN QUESTION

I've already checked the quantities on the preschedule....The hourly deals (allegedly) for HE 3 & 6 are in question.

OUR OASIS requests indicate 5 Mwh for HE3 & some other quantity (either 0 or 10--indicating a potential cut--the original deal was for 60).  The Oasis request will shed some light on this. 

So we have for HE3 & 5:

Our OASIS requests
Deals entered in Enpower
Deals entered in the P&L sheet.

Call HL&P & see if they show anything ABOVE & BEYOND the preschedule for these hours.  I'll be back around 1pm & we can finish this and the minor price discrepancies.

Lastly,   can you provide to me a copy of my contract?    Mine is packed in a box somewhere due to the move.

Thank you for your time.

Lloyd,

First, I would thank you for taking time out of your busy day on Friday to
touch base with me via email about where we are in the interview process.

When I spoke with John Forney on Friday afternoon, I did not know exactly
how to handle a situation that had come to my attention early that morning.
I wanted to spend some time mulling it over prior to emailing about it.

As you may have remembered from previous conversations, I was off for four
days last week, returning to BTU on Friday at 5:30 a.m.  When I arrived to
work, I was greeted by Dan Bailey, who informed me of a very interesting
conversation that he'd had with Steve Olindi.

Apparently, Steve had taken the liberty of informing Dan of my interviewing
activities with Enron the previous week.

With this information at his disposal, Dan (who is my senior trader and,
therefore, someone to whom I report) decided to share this with my
co-workers at the QSE.

Both Brandon Whittle and Dan Bailey's response to this was to proceed in
questioning me about the innerworkings of Enron's trading practice.  I felt
that if I shared what information I do have, that would be considered a
breech of confidentiality.  However, they do have their intentions set on
securing interviews of thier own, so their persistence increased over the
course of the day.  This made my day extremely uncomfortable even though I
repeatedly downplayed the interview.

With this leak of information, that I assumed was to be kept confidential,
my concern is that this has put both my job at BTU and the possibility of
employment with Enron in danger.

I am interested in the opportunity with your company, but am now very
concerned where this puts me in both areas.

Please advise.

Kevin Libby

Mark,
Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO.
He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th.

We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.

However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market.
The replacement reserve prices have been zero.

Could you provide some help on this?

Thanks,

When we receive an OOMC,  we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online.
If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME,  then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down.   We dont actually want to do this,  as there are some expensive start charges associated with this.

We will discuss further in the meeting.

Subject:	Ercot Questions



David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money.""



Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment"" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comment.""
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that "" it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME.""
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for ""forcing them to OOME our plant.""

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

Thanks,

John:

	One more thing I neglected to mention.  Deal Blotter only refreshed lookups once per day, the first time it is run.  After that, you must do it manually.  When Deal Blotter comes up, you will see that one of the main menu items is ""Refresh.""  Choose Refresh, Lookups, All and the lookups will be refreshed.  That should solve the problem.  Sorry for not mentioning that earlier.

"Ancillary Services Questions","

Mark,
We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services;       Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis.
We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require.

For example,  on 9/27,   Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup.      Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour.
The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.

Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing,  etc.?

I will be out of the office next week,   so can you reply to Doug Gilbert-Smith?   His e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com.
Otherwise,  he can be reached at 713-853-9310.

We have had problems locating Jerry on occasion in order to affect schedule changes.   He lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work.    In these instances, we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation.    They have refused in the past, as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry.

The plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions.

I have sold the swap to them at $24.50.   I sell fixed and buy floating.       If you think that the pool will be high,  then you buy fixed and take to the pool.
You will buy fixed and sell floating.    Net,  we are left with two fixed prices.  Very cool.

Subject:	Frontera Proposal for tomorrow



Ken,
As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.

I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     

The benefit in this swap would be:
hedge against floating price
lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues
avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.



Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   
I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.

Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.


Let me know what you think,

What is the status of George?   I think that you have been speaking with Lloyd Will concerning bringing him over from EES.   George is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.    I would think not, at this time.

JF-

I believe we discussed the 'static sch fees' that they (HL&P) apply to schedules coming in and out of their system.  These fees are separate from the ERCOT fees and actually ERCOT itself does not have anything to do with them (meaning they do not track the fees at all, the fees are handle at the counterparty level).  I will try to track down the last invoice that Reliant sent to us for these fees, it is a separate invoice from the regular invoice, so that we can review it.

Michael,
we checked with Reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed.     That's not suprising,  however.
Does Reliant bill this directly or does the Ercot ISO bill this to us?     What is the reason for this fee?

If you replace this power,  please remove the appropriate counterparty in the portal and replace with new counterparty.

The Frontera plant is currently NOT scheduled to run this weekend or Monday.    We are currently,  as of Friday,  experiencing problems with units #2 & #3.  These tripped offline when a breaker problem on CPL's side occurred.
We have been asked by Ercot to reflect in the Resource Plan that unit #1 is available but offline.   We have done so.  When the other units become available,   please update them as available in the Resource Plan for the remaining hours of Saturday.    We should make sure that we have OOM premiums (up and down) and zero mw's scheduled.

"Interzonal   Trading","

	Attention:
The Ercot ISO has been settling our trades scheduled to the North by giving us the West or South Balancing Energy price.      We have officially disputed this allocation, as we believe that we would,  at most,  incur a load deviation imbalance in the North zone (to be settled in the North).  
Again,  a purchase in the South scheduled to our load in the North is receiving the South or West prices.

We are awaiting Ercot's explanation.

Until further notice,  do not schedule energy from the South or West to the North.         You may still engage in intrazonal, or same zone,   trades (QSE to QSE ).

What IS permitted is imported from outside Ercot into the North zone.     The DC tie is in the North and we should stay aggressive,  working with the SPP team to secure transmission to and from Ercot.    When in doubt,   wake me up.

Update:

At 6 pm,  our Rep from Ercot agreed that the schedule mentioned above should have load imbalance assessed at the NORTH price.     However,   I still cannot accept his answer as the gospel,  as any written interpretation of their tariff will always overrule our guy.


I will advise when it is safe to re-enter the water,  but for now:   EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL!

"FW: Frontera OOM for 8/30","

To:	Comeaux, Keith; Lenartowicz, Chris; ','; Capasso, Joe; Day, Smith L.; Errigo, Joe; McElreath, Alexander; Miller, Jeffrey; Olinde Jr., Steve; Saibi, Eric

Subject:	Frontera OOM for 8/30



Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.   We had  submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium  because the unit was offline.   In the Resource Plan,  we can  attach a premium for OOM up or down.   In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was ""unavailable and offline"".  
   The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.

Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.   We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.   Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13,  to control congestion.   They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400.
I called Mark Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep.,  and I explained the situation.   I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.   I also wanted to know how this would settle.

His reply is as follows:

Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant,  that changed our status from unavailable to available.
Since we had an implied low premium (zero)  on our plant,  we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon.
We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.  The mcp was low all day ( mid teens)  yesterday.
If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs,  we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.



We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available  with a $50 premium.    This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs.   
The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.   Please review this to understand why this applies.



This was a very educational process.    We think that in revising our Resource Plan ""on the fly""  we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.


Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented:

If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.    Say the unit is NOT available.

If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums:

$50 premium for OOM up.
$10 premium for OOM down.

These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order.
If we are OOM'd up,   the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.

If we are OOM'd down,  then we should be paid the mcp + premium.

Please call me if you have questions,

"Congrats!","
Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     Hope she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  ""how is the baby?""   versus ""where is the baby?""
But,  as Kim used to say,  ""enough about you,   let's talk about me.""   I spoke with Tim B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.

 The HR department here in Houston wants me to entertain other opportunities within Houston and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.   

Anyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.      

 I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.

I have spoken directly with Steve about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and Steve has apologized.

Mr. Hinson,
Sorry I missed your call.      The Frontera Plant is composed of 2 CT's and and steamer.      Three units in total,  however,   the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's.    I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance.

There is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered.       These units are behind a common point,  so the rules as they were written dont consider us.     

I know that this is more than you asked for,  but for whatever it's worth........

I have a couple other questions that you may be able to help with.

Have you or anyone in your area looked at the metering requirements for curtailable loads?  Typical cost/configuration/communications support - etc.
How do CPS-1 & CPS-2 play out in the ERCOT market?  Controls on paying for a service versus leaning on the grid.

"Ercot Loads","

Brett,
I have a business question,  for a change.   Ercot load is forecast to be as high as 46,124 for hour ending 1200 today.   The actual printed from the website is less than 43,000.   I know that there is South to North congestion,   but is this actual load right?    Is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap?

Any help you can give would be appreciated.   I dont think that this is proprietary info or anything.    I am trying to see if the forecast is worthless.

	My relo expenses have not been turned in as yet.    Do I turn those in to you?     I am due the closing costs, etc.  due to my move from Portland.
Also,   Johnny Palmer was very pleasant to speak with.    I appreciate the effort that you have made in trying to generate interest in me from the inside.
Johnny, however,   was not optimistic that he had anything available for a Director level position. 
	  I have been talking with Portland (Greg Wolfe,  Tim Belden,  and Amy Fitzpatrick)    If nothing opens up here by Wednesday,   I need to get out to the West and start training so that I can make some money for the company.
I am still building,  staffing, & trading for the Ercot region,  but I am eager to go quickly if no one wants me in Houston.    

Thanks!

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

"Ercot Questions","

David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me ""dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money.""



Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a ""breakeven.""   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had ""no comment"" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has ""no comment.""
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that "" it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME.""
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for ""forcing them to OOME our plant.""

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

Thanks,


JForney

"Howdy","Amy,
Hope everything is going well with you.   I dont know if Tim has talked with you, but I am considering returning to Portland.  
I am talking with Wolfe and Tim,  but I would like to keep things low key.    I know this all seems pretty weird,   but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major,  immediate decisions to make.    Basically,   the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real Time,  similar to how we did it in Portland.
Unfortunately,  that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could).     Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had,  I never would have left.

Anyway,  Kim Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within Enron Houston and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists.   She is easy to work with and is being very helpful.    However,  I have expressed  to Kevin and Kim that my first preference would be to return to Portland.

I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.   
 I would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse.     I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me.

Thanks,
JMF

"June 24th","Chris,
I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes,  but was unsuccessful.    I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.     Enpower is out of balance  and the books are as well.  
Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced,  as we cannot tie out with our customers.

We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status,  then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in.

You mention inadvertancy in your Notes,  but I dont know the particulars of this problem.    I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.     If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift,   then you should be in balance when you leave.
The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.

Give me a call to straighten this out.

	We cover open position and submit schedules to Ercot
	We monitor Real Time and handle continigencies
	Wholesale settlement provided,   ancillary service charges , local congestion,  etc is to be passed to EES.

Narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a September 1st start  at the latest.

I'm not sure what has been communicated regarding the enrollments.  I wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the current status. 

The (5) packaged ice accounts were accepted by TXU and load availability was confirmed.  The 814 enrollment request will be submitted today/tomorrow by CSC.

The (28) target accounts were rejected by Reliant as the rate class is full. There is no load available.

If the money, at the end of the day,   is insufficient to pay A&B,  then this full cost will be allocated on a load share ratio basis.     This charge will be allocated under the UFE (unaccounted for energy) charge type.      
If C & D serve load,  then they will share the expense of paying for the balancing energy price to A & B.      A & B escapes this expense allocation, as they do not serve load.

Subject:	Re: ERCOT SETTLEMENTS   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Example assumptions:
Market consists entirely of 4 QSEs who have the following schedule-actual variances in a particular hour; A=+50MW; B=+50MW; C=-25MW & D=-25MW.
Market energy price is $100/MWH.

Since money paid by C & D is insufficient to fully reimburse A & B (5000+5000-2500-2500=5000), what happens in the settlement?  Do A & B get proportionally less than they otherwise would have gotten?  Or, is there a banking mechanism that builds up in hours where there are overages and is drawn down in hours where there are shortages (such as example above)?

Subject:	RE: Question


Jeff,
If you've rec'd a deployment instruction that is a Category 2,3  or 4, it implies the deployment is to relieve operational, or local, CONG.   The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch algorithm has determined your unit is  located such that its movement per the instructions will help to alleviate the  local congestion.  Following is copied from the document, ""Market  Bulletin-Thursday August 8, 2001"".  This is the last paragraph on page 2 of  that document.
""Therefore, when Operational  Congestion exists, the solution found in STEP 1 may be augmented in STEP 2 with  both resource specific and modified portfolio awards. The result of STEP 2 is  always a set of final portfolio based and resource specific dispatch  instructions to be issued to the QSEs to solve the operational congestion.  Because the final portfolio based dispatch instruction equals the net result of  the preliminary STEP 1 portfolio based balancing energy awards and any STEP 2  portfolio adjustments, the QSE's bid curve may not match the MCPE  determined in STEP 1. This may be causing the appearance of being incorrectly  ""struck"". Whenever a QSE receives unit specific deployments, it will  also receive a Category 1 portfolio based deployment. ERCOT expects that the  portfolio-based instruction will be followed.""
So, even though your customer is determining your bids, your  unit could be called upon to relieve any local Cong that results from ""Step 1""  (per the referenced bulletin) deployments to resolve load/gen imbalances and  zonal cong, if that unit is deemed to have an effect (the shift factor) on  the constrained line.  
 
Clear as mud?  Hope this  helps.  
 
I'm leaving here in about five minutes to go to an appt with  Holly, but will be back in on Monday.  
 
Regards,
 
Brett

Subject: RE: Question
Brett--
we're  being deployed down (DBES) for more than what our bid states.  In
other  words, we had a DBES Bid in for $-5 and we're getting deployed to  dec
generation and the MCP is $28.  The kicker is the ""category"" of DBES  in
which we're being deployed.  I just got off the phone with Mark  Paterson &
he's indicated that if you are deployed to provide DBES in  ""category"" 2
through 4, then that DBES Deployment was given--unit specific--  OUTSIDE THE
BID STACK (he said it was because we were CAUSING  congestion).
My concern is that our bids are instructed by our  customer.  The customer
is wondering why we're being deployed above our  bid.  Also of concern is
that, according to Mark, that these  DBES's--categories 2 through 4 are
treated and settled as OOM's--largely a  different settlement than DBES.
Add to that that the ""category"" treatment  relative to settlement (or even
being mentioned, for that matter) is NOT in  the protocols--per Mark.
He's just sent me a one-page explanation of this  process so I need to
review it but have you heard of  this?

I notified Coleen at the ISO that Frontera will be off line starting at 2300 hours tonight for economic reasons.  I also told Coleen the plant will be available if needed.

The ISO sent OOMC of 164 mws for 2400 9-25-01 through 2400 9-26-01.  I called the ISO and spoke with Jay about the OOMC.  Jay told me that he will probably hold the plant at minimum load tonight.  He wasn't sure what loading the plant would be at during the day.

I notified GENCO ( John Pappa ) of the OOMC and told him that I will advise him of the output level once the ISO lets me know.

I called ( Ken ) and told him about the OOMC.  I told Ken the plant will have to run all day tommorrow.

At 1945, the ISO revised the OOMC for the 26th.  The new OOMC is 184 mws/24hr.

Settlements is working hard,  but TA doesnt say a word to the RT traders here,  as it would be political suicide.     That's why she turned toward us.
She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO,   and I talked to her,   explaining my expectations.   She was squirming  about saying that she or Rebecca wouldnt know the answers.   Im cool with that,  but cant you find out?   Everything is such a big struggle here.

Subject:	RE: STATIC SCHEDULING FEES 

JF-

I believe we discussed the 'static sch fees' that they (HL&P) apply to schedules coming in and out of their system.  These fees are separate from the ERCOT fees and actually ERCOT itself does not have anything to do with them (meaning they do not track the fees at all, the fees are handle at the counterparty level).  I will try to track down the last invoice that Reliant sent to us for these fees, it is a separate invoice from the regular invoice, so that we can review it.

Michael,
we checked with Reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed.     That's not suprising,  however.
Does Reliant bill this directly or does the Ercot ISO bill this to us?     What is the reason for this fee?

"Ancillary service awards for Frontera","	


Jerrry,

See the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow.    We are talking with the Ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the	OOM  (Out of Merit)  decrease for today.   It is our understanding,  per the protocols,  that when we are dispatched down the ISO keeps our $35  scheduled sale  whole.    We are paid this revenue stream (by our sale counterparty) PLUS the greater of:  the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero.    If you are decreased by 50 mw's for an hour you receive:
$35 sale + balancing $33.50 = 68.50/mw for not running your plant.   

For the capacity tomorrow,
We will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest.    The Resource Plan is increased to reflect 400 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour.    The EMS will only show 400 mw until we get deployed.  
  At the time of deployment,  we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised.
We bid in a  Non-spin product which requires us to respond within 30 "".   They can take partial hours, at their option.

I hope this helps.

"what's happening?","

AJ,
Thanks for checking in with me.   I had a couple of questions:
Does Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively?      I currently do several things:
I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk.    I also manage the Ercot Asset book.   I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas.
I am required to trade gas along with  the power in order to properly hedge the plant.
I would be interested in continuing in this area. 

Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko.   I could send my resume,  but if we dont have paralell needs,  then I wont bother.
I have some other things that I am working on.

Thanks again for asking.  This company will be fine,  but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years.   When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life.   However,   although I am sure that Enron will bounce back,  I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so.    

I have been consistenly profitable in my time here.   I have never been on a losing team - we have always made major money for the company,  so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding.

Anyway,  thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you.

"Frontera for hour ending 7 tomorrow,   9/21","


For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report    

The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.

Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.


Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.

Call if you have questions.

1)  ERCOT conference call

John Adams with ERCOT called at 3:30 pm on Saturday afternoon to say Enron responded to instructions inappropriately during Friday's frequency control test while under single control area operations.    Friday's instruction from Ercot was for Enron to deploy balancing energy while Enron did not deploy balancing energy as per the instruction because no balancing bid was in place.  Enron  was not the only QSE to be confused by these instructions.  

Adams later clarified the definitions of the operation constraints
OC1	worst level constraint

OC0	commercially significant constraints CSC) approved once per year by ERCOT

OC2	entered manually through operator entry

OC3	populated by DC power flows (FST); designed to include all generators in the constraint equation and adjust for load flows.

John encouraged all to understand the distinctions between all these constraints before actively participating in the balancing energy market.

2)  schedule mismatch

Enron had a schedule mismatch for Sunday's (7-8-01) schedules.  The mismatch was with a 5 mw obligation to BTU for HE 7 to HE 22.  Sunny and I reviewed this situation on Saturday evening.  Sunny said he submitted this schedule several times on Saturday and early Sunday morning.  The off peak hours matched fine.

Kim,
Keenon has been recommended to Doug as a possiblity in RT.   I think our roster has been filled out,  however,  I had promised this guy an interview before I knew that Lloyd had lifted some people.
Can we schedule an interview with Keenon,  as I think that he is a strong prospect.

I will send you a copy of his resume via office mail.     He can be reached at 713-410-2255.

Please let me know what you think.

Lloyd,
We received this from Preston.     Everyone on this distribution list would assume that EES is waiting on information from us.
We are still awaiting meaningful data from Narsimha/Preston.
I am going to discuss this with Narsimha.
I feel like a reply is warranted,  as we are making no headway on this project.

I fear for Preston if he is to work with me in the future.

Mark/ Pat,

Please see the attached file.

It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.

In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
This brings up two questions.

First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?

Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?

Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.

Sincerely,
Joe Capassso
Enron Power Marketing Inc.

Subject:	guidelines....


<< A few etiquette guidelines for men:

Any Man who brings a camera to a stag night may be legally killed or beaten
by his fellow partygoers.

Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.

It is OK for a man to cry under the following circumstances:
a. When a heroic dog dies to save his master
b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse
c. After wrecking your boss' car
d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into ""The Crying Game""

Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a friend out of
jail within 12 hours.

If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off limits
forever, unless you actually marry her.

The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's running late is
5 minutes. Maximum waiting time is 6 minutes. For a girl, you have to wait
10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10
scale.

Bitching about the brand of free beer in a friend's fridge is forbidden.

However, feel free to gripe if the temperature is unsuitable.

No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man.

In fact, even remembering your buddies birthday is optional.

When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may always ask
the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.

It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're sunning on
a tropical beach... and it's delivered by a beautiful supermodel... and it's
free.

Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.

If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem. You didn't see nothin'.

Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies until
they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to drink as much beer
as the other sports watchers.

Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza, but
not both. That's just plain mean.

Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing: both
urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an almost
imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.

"New deal value for 9/25","
Andrea,
apparently an imbalance deal was entered under Teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed.    I show negative new deal value for Teco Services,  when I sold above the curve on their behalf.
I assume this is the reason for the negative new deal value.

The deal has been revised,  as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway.   This imbal. sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight.

Will I ever get a true up for the negative new deal value?
