Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 5/28/2002.

Over the past several weeks, numerous analysts' reports have suggested
there has been a massive destruction of gas demand, as gas prices have
recently moved above $3.50/mcf. We believe the foundation for many of these
reports is both poor analytical methodology and bad data. To conclude that
weather-adjusted natural gas demand has fallen by 5 to 10 bcf per day
implies a demand deterioration level similar to what we saw in early 2001,
when prices soared to near $10 per mcf. Unlike then, today's fuel-switching
incentives still favor natural gas. Secondly, there is little economic
incentive for today's industrial consumers of natural gas to shut down
plants in an improving economic environment. The current economy is very
different than the deteriorating economic environment in early 2001.

Joe - talked w/ Zisman about Centana this p.m.  He agrees that so long as the party ENA shorted is different from the counter party on the implied storage agreement, then they are on shaky ground....and run the risk of blowing up the entire deal.  My sense is that should they desire to hold in escrow additional amounts (without the estate agreement)  they are exercising set off rights w/ affiliated ownership under an implied storage lease agreement.  That is some seriously bad ju ju (translated...they better think again).

I am going to push for cash committee approval tomorrow or Thursday as discussed yesterday.  Shemin should have her revised doc this p.m. or tomorrow a.m.

Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost on pre-petition retainage?

Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

Subject:	DEC. MRT GAS



ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

$380,000 that they have on their account, due to the prepays, for the rest of

Subject: Flows


In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

Doug, 

Are the cash committee's activities in some way monitored by the court?  If so, then we can likely proceed with the payment.  If not, how do we proceed in the manner proposed below?  I will work with accounting to determine if there are any offsetting liabilities.

My view is that we cannot return this without court approval.  I assume
that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.

I want to get this to Stuart for his approval this evening so we can have it teed up for tomorrow morning.  The attached is just the verbage, but I think it may make sense to attach your spreadsheet and possibly some support for our Bridgeline valuation as appendices.

Shares of Independent Power 
Producers and Traders Fall 




By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/images/spacer.gif>

[News item from Reuters] Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities and heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday, sending shares of independent producers and traders falling. The downturn was triggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of a financing arrangement used by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) which prompted unwelcome comparisons to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos. (NYSE: WMB). 

Analysis: Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for the recently hard-hit independent power producers (IPPs), more unwanted bad news has once again plagued this sector. In addition to Dynegy and Williams, companies such as Calpine, Mirant and AES have had significant news in the past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business losses, lowered credit ratings, softening energy commodity prices, and questions of accounting practices. Let's take a look at the latest developments for these companies. 

Dynegy shares closed at $28.79 per share, down by about 4 percent, as the market reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegy's use of off-balance-sheet transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between cash flow and net income. Project Alpha, as it was called, was blessed by Dynegy's former auditor, Andersen, and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers. Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of business practices that Enron engaged in. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emphasized, ""The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us with a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit."" Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved, Dynegy stock was not used to back the loans, and the transaction was disclosed in Dynegy's financial reports last year. In 2000 the company reported ""unrealized gains"" of $354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts, increasing the gap between its profit and cash flow. Trading companies include the estimated value for ""derivative"" contracts they use for future buying and selling of commodities in net income as ""unrealized gains."" A special purpose entity (SPE) was formed in April of last year with a $300-million loan from Citigroup Inc. The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called DMT Supply LP, in which Dynegy held a stake. According to Dynegy, during the first nine months of operation, DMT bought gas from the entity at below-market prices and resold the gas at a profit. But during future years of the project scheduled to end in 2006, DMT will buy gas at above-market gas prices, generating unrealized losses. By arranging transactions in this manner, Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by $80 million. But according to WSJ, higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than those assigned to cash transactions which creates a ""disconnect"" between reported net income and cash flow that investors could notice. 

Williams shares also dropped by 4.5 percent on Wednesday to close at $23.08 per share on news from WSJ, which reported that the SEC is looking into the company's third-quarter results. In reaction, Williams clarified that it had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional information concerning the company's 2001 third-quarter results but was told after a review that no financial adjustments were needed. Williams' spokesperson Jim Gipson said, ""We received an informal, confidential request for information by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q. They asked a couple of questions, we responded in writing, they called back in seven days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required."" Gipson emphasized that, ""We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at the SEC."" Williams reported a third-quarter net income of $221.3 million, up from $176.5 million, or 27 cents a share, earned in the same quarter one year ago. The quarter included a one-time charge of $71 million for the company's investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group. On March 7, Williams announced it had taken a $2.1-billion charge in the fourth quarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications. Williams reported a loss of $477.7 million for the fourth quarter. 

Calpine shares were down 6.26 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to news that Moody's had downgraded Calpine's unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1, along with a negative ratings outlook. Approximately $12.4 billion of long-term debt instruments are affected. This follows a March 29 report, when the company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company discovered that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not actually available. In a press release, Calpine said 2001 earnings would be lowered by $11.5 million after tax from the $659.6 million reported on Jan. 31. The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extraordinary items by 3 cents a share, to $1.87. 

Moody's sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine's high leverage, limited financial flexibility, and substantial ongoing capital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program. Calpine's debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company continues its development of committed projects. While Calpine's total electric sales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants, it is expected to be selling into unfavorable market conditions. Moody's anticipated that lower spark spreads (the difference between electric and fuel prices) will lower in the near term. Moody's warned that the negative outlook reflects the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpine's liquidity position further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations. Calpine plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expansions during 2002 and 2003. Moody's also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine's $2 billion of senior secured credit facilities. According to Moody's, the Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpine's collateral package. A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpine's equity interests in Saltend and nine U.S. power plants. A principal part of the collateral package is Calpine's natural-gas properties, which may be subject to fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices. Moody's claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven. 

Mirant also continues to experience hard times. Its shares were down 6.21 percent to close at $13.60 per share. Although yesterday's downturn may have largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector, Mirant has been involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to try to shore up its balance sheet. On April 1 it was reported that Mirant has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensland up for sale. Queensland's government-owned CS Energy, currently 40-percent owner of Kogan Creek, is reported to be a potential buyer, as are MIM and Macarthur Coal. In a separate transaction announced on March 27, Cleco agreed to buy Mirant's 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the companies are building in northeastern Louisiana. The merchant power plant is owned by a joint venture between the two companies. Cleco said it would assume Mirant's $19.5-million equity commitment and pay $48 million to retire Mirant's project debt. Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a combination of new common stock and debt. 

AES has also fallen on tough times. Although the company's stock was up yesterday to close at $8.96 per share, the company continues to struggle. Early this week, AES sent a shockwave through the U.K. market when it announced its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant located in Wales into receivership. The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 was funded with a $214.5-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche Bank. Richard Hill, joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London, who is charged with selling the asset, says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non-recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet to be fully determined. Similar to the U.S. market, wholesale prices in the U.K. reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spring's new bilateral trading system. Accordingly, one report claims at least a dozen project loans are either in technical default, have broken their covenants, or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio. 

In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purchasing AESGener's 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion de Energia Electrica (Sigen) services company for an undisclosed amount. GE already owned 60 percent of the joint venture. AESGener, controlled by AES, posted losses of Pesos $5,027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos $2,275mil in 2000. Operating results were down by 12.5 percent to Pesos $70,241mil on sales declining 23.8 percent to Pesos $347,009mil. The performance of AES' Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes, and selling off the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses. Recently appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chile. 

The fallout of the Enron debacle, lowered credit ratings, and weak commodity prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the ropes struggling to make the bell. The companies are aggressively working to put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales, postponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs. But as quickly as these companies' fortunes have nosedived, they can rise once again. Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world.

Subject:	DEC. MRT GAS



ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

My view is that we cannot return this without court approval.  I assume
that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

Hi Gerald,
Yesterday you gave me the gas transportation contract between CIPCO and
ENA. Do you have a copy of the firm gas storage agreement between the
parties? My no is 5-3910. Thanks

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be
delivered to Enron North America.

Subject: Lease Update


Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer
up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in
the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled
the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as
the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the

Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next

morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed

that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to

fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and
4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered
putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to
you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good
schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in
Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased.
30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have

lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the
spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite
and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston
boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed
but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and
closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great
if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

"DEC. MRT GAS","

ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

Subject: My New Position


Dear friends and colleagues,
 
I wanted to inform you that I am leaving Hart Publications shortly to take a position as the Majority Staff Director of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. The Subcommittee is part of the House Committee on Resources and has jurisdiction over oil and gas development, coal and hard rock mining and geothermal energy development on federal lands including the offshore Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountains and Alaska. My last day at Hart is May 10 and I start at the Subcommittee on May 13.

I am looking forward to this new opportunity though I have had a great experience at Hart Publications and Hart Downstream Energy Services and I am really going to miss the people I work with here. Hart is really like a family - in the Washington office and in Houston. I can't speak highly enough about the organization and the professional people I have worked with for over eight years.  <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

If you want to reach me at the Subcommittee, the number is (202) 225-9297. I believe that my email will be jack.belcher@mail.house.gov <mailto:jack.belcher@mail.house.gov>

I look foward to staying in touch.

Sincerely,

Jack

Jack Belcher

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks
again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt.
I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your
spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick

I spoke to legal.  Other than the non-solicitation agreements some former employees may have signed companies have not been informed that they may not hire Enron employees.  Particularly in the case where an employee seeks out employment with another company the other company is in no way liable for speaking to or employing that employee as long as the employee is not under an employment contract.

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the

clarification on that.


Let me know then we'll finalize.

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your

was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a

continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP have called asking for their money.  Please advise.

Shemin, attached below is your last draft of the letter agreement with our
additional comments.  Some of the comments we previously discussed on the
phone.  I understand my business person is having discussions with Enron
management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore,
the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to
this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out
of the office, so these comments are subject to his review and additional
changes.  We are fine with the Escrow Agreement as long as it is understood
that Enron will pay all costs associated with the Escrow Agreement.

Joe, the EES book data is getting closer to what we need but not there yet.

Please discuss w/ EES Risk (Scott Mills?):
1) The Price (NG) positions are expressed in PV'd quantity.  We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  
2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis.

Maria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.

Please set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)  As you commented, we need to determine that we agree with the methodology and conversion factor prior to including basis in the hedge quantity.

Thanks

Attached is the information that we discussed last evening.

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index.
	The tabs that indicate ""OXY II Only"" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.
	The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity.

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

Had a nice weekend with the family down at KC.
Wrapped up a deposition in San Antonio at at about 1, eat and headed to KC. 
Arrived at about 4. shot limit at 100 acres. Not alot of birds, but enough. 
Birds very wise. Had to hide well. Lots of birds across the road feeding in 
the field, lots hanging out on wire. few moving over our ponds.
Saw lots of coyotes. 4 at 100acres, two at 500.
heavy rain at 7 pm. cool front.
Sheila came down with boys on sat. caught a few fish at 100 acres, shot 7 
birds. Suprised many still in area with rain and north wind. Harder to hide 
with two wiggling boys.
Never got to scout 500 acres, by mark hunted it last weekend according to 
his note and shot only two birds. I saw a decent number in the area of 
between our gate and road to Opiela's house. The field across the road from 
the front gate is stacked with sunfowers. They have not dropped seed yet, 
still yellow. in a week or so, could draw birds. still lots feeding across 
road from 100 acres.
John, saw a few deer tracks around your feeders, and lots of really big pig 
tracks.
If someone is going down in the next two weeks, please let me know. I left a

pistol at the house, Ms. Opiela went over and got it for me. She will hold 
onto it until I can get some one to pick it up.

Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data.  Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.

Subject: Monster US Trade Deficit, FX World June 20, 2002



Thought you would find this guy's FX write-up interesting today...

 

From: Michael F McGuinness on 06/20/2002 10:09 AM

 

 

Simple thoughts.....

 

US assets get sold... (mostly equities).... and then the USD is sold.....

 

It's not the other way around.

 

The world is losing confidence.  Everyday we get more terrorist activity around

the world. (sorry Reuters.... it's terrorism....)

 

 Uncertainty is higher...... Risk is higher...... People around the world want

their money close to home. So off they go to sell their investments here in the

States, sell the USD and buy their home currency.

 

US April trade deficit came in at $35.94 bln..... a record. Here's the part

that's amazing..... the trade imbalance in goods.... US deficit in goods

only.... $39.92 bln..... $40 bln goods imbalance in just one month....

 

And where are we importing from.....

 

China.... $7.55 bln and this is a natural phenomena since about any product

sold these days under $100 in the US these days is made in China......

compliments from Mark....  China has a competitive advantage, and trade rules

will dictate that goods will originate from China until the cost structure

adjusts...... say in 25 years......

 

Western Europe...... $7.244 bln..... yeah the standard of living in Europe must

be the same as China....... with higher short term rates in Europe..... growth

in many industries in Europe is from the US. How can anybody in Brussels think

that a trade surplus with the US almost equal to China's (and one that is

larger than Japan's...) is a proper economic condition.......   As I said on

Tuesday.... I believe that the purchasing power parity level for the EUR is up

over $1.0800. (this is based on some long term thoughts.... that the old DEM

for PPP was 1.80 against the USD....)

 

The EUR is undervalued by 12.5%. That's why I think it's funny that European

politicians and the press feel that the EUR is strong up here the .9500 - .9600

area.

 

If a few people in the Bush administration start thinking that the US trade

picture needs to change...... you may have heard the last utterance of anyone

saying they want a strong USD.......

 

The US current account deficit in Q1 2002 was $112.5 bln....  So the US has to

attract $37.50 bln per month to keep this in balance......   to do so either

asset prices need to go lower or the USD has to go lower......  both is

happening.....

 

Well, the US trade deficit is getting closer to 4.5%  of GDP.  Just the

deficit.... and just extrapolate that for the CA deficit.......

 

So the EUR just popped up over .9600 and a boatload of stops were just done

into the .9625-30.  And now will have settled in at .9610. There are no

retracements in the EUR, just quiet periods of consolidation.

 

Until we get a screaming need to own US equities..... there appears to be no

need to own USD, and no retracement of the EUR.

 

Japan's trade surplus with the US..... $6.8 bln.  The game continues.....

USD/YEN 123.50 and no Bank of Japan...... I think, it would not be in the best

interest for the Japanese to be seen intervening right after this monster of a

trade deficit.

 

Japan overnight announced that their May trade surplus rose 715% y/y.......

Anything that climbs over 700 % is not normal...... most of Japan's trade

surplus with the rest of Asia rose 626%......

 

But every month,  Japanese authorities will need to vacuum up about $7 bln USD

just to keep the YEN stable against the USD,  as the current imbalance in trade

creates pressures for a firmer YEN.......  Who knows, maybe  a few voices in

Asia could clamor....  that the YEN is too weak.....

 

Bank of Japan foreign reserves in USD is over $400 bln these days and climbing,

(I think $406 bln in April and $419 bln in May)........ Maybe Japan will

someday dollarize........

 

Canada's trade surplus with the world is up 11.0% to $5.2 bln. Automotive

exports... the key.  The CAD trade surplus with the US was $8.2 bln and a

deficit with the rest of the world at $3.0 bln. (The US commerce department has

the CAD surplus at $4.1 bln....)

 

SGD at 1.7775.... firmest level since last October. It's moving on it's own, no

sympathy move with the YEN.... so either the YEN has to play catch-up or the

YEN is going to weaken against the rest of Asia....

 

Thai baht is also firm at 42.00 against the USD.  Korean won still at 1210.

Asia definitely looks better with the US trade deficit.

 

Venezuelan bolivar a record low at 1305 to the USD, since May 1 the VEB has

devalued 52%.   Not much more to say.....

 

Everyone have a great day....... the above thoughts are for your reading

pleasure. Any questions call me. All the best.

 <<IENER010702BSOW.PDF>>

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 01/07/02.

Recent energy investment sentiment could be characterized as a fear-driven,
cautious psychology that has led to a generally under-owned condition for
most energy stocks.  A major contributor to this negative psychology has
been the underlying belief of investors that ""energy stocks always bottom
several times before a sustained upward move.""  While that was true in the
1998/1999 downturn, we are convinced that today's energy fundamentals are
far different than those experienced in the downturn several years ago.  In
fact, we believe today's environment is much more similar to that
experienced in the 1972/1974 timeframe, when energy stocks experienced a
two-year run-up followed by a recession and subsequent nine month sell off.
In the 1974 downturn, however, the stocks experienced one bottom in the
late fall and never looked back.  Likewise, we are convinced that energy
stocks have already seen their lowest levels and as strong commodity
fundamentals become visible later in the first quarter, the stocks will
begin to run.  In other words, we believe the energy stocks are near the
bottom of a cyclical downturn within what we believe is going to be a
longer-term secular upswing.  That means that now is the time to be buying
energy stocks!

Subject: Flows


In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

> weekly injection since mid-June 1994 - leaves current storage of 1.077 tcf
> only 86 bcf below last year and 40 bcf from the middle of the 1994-1999
> range. Based on seasonal patterns, large injections should continue over
the
> next nine weeks, when storage increases are typically the largest of the
> year. So far this injection season, inventories have risen 450 bcf, or
100%
> faster than the typical rate of 220 over the first six weeks of the refill
> season. If inventories rise only half that rate, at 50% faster than the
> norm, storage would pass the middle of the typical range next week and end
> October at nearly 3 tcf, or 120 bcf from the top of the range.
>
> While our projected inventory injections seem bearish, we still look for
> relatively strong price support above $4/mmBtu through the year. Even with
> inventories rising quickly, there seems to be genuine concern for the need
> to satisfy summer demand for electricity (air conditioning), especially in
> the Southwest U.S. By the end of the year, however, we expect inventory
> coverage of forward demand to be on par with normal levels.
>
> While we continue to feel that demand has been a major contributor to the
> large storage injections, supply also seems to be playing a stronger role.
> Reported DOE growth of 3% in 2000, which comes with a one percentage point
> room for error due to data imperfections, comes mostly from Texas and
> Wyoming. From Canada, higher than expected production from Alberta, in
> addition to the eastern offshore, seems to have influenced the large
> shipments to the U.S. Contrary to expectation, the Alliance pipeline has
> been running at 1.5 bcf/d capacity - and often beyond - since its

Ed,
    Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. 
 
 Duke/Centana 
  Money wires will be complete on April 1.  The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1.  I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 
Ponderosa Energy Partners
 I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant.   I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where  I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over.
 
Pace Energy
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000.
 
General Land Office.
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal dealsheet for the natural gas volumes.

Subject: RE: age of joe's deer


I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen that 10 point I shot ""on the hoof"", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out lower jaw for inspection, you would have said ""Damn, that's an old deer."" 
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler formation (9"" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side, the younger one looked like a ""thoroughbread Horse"", while mine looked like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together about what ""formula"" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10 point was ""Mature and on his way down"" while the young one (Same deer that Keith has seen, too) is ""Mature and on his way up"". The last thing I have to say about that was that the ""Young"" deer of the two was definitely the ""dominant"" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my ""ol' bastard"" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to ""pour the Chili"" while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the ""stud"", ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stud, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anything. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and doesn't ""disappear"" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from year to year.

Men:

The dreaded time has come. Rent goes up and it is a month earlier.
The initial $8,000 payment is due to Mertz on March 1, 2002.

In addition, I paid Mertz $500 for the protien that he fed during the last 
hunting season.

I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42. Send to 815 walker, 
suite 1447, H/T 77002. Thank you.

Erik.

   Wednesday 6/5/02
   Raymond James Energy Daily Update

   FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

   Energy Price Summary (Close Tuesday 6/4/02):
   Oil (WTI) - $25.33, up $0.25
   12-Month Oil Futures Strip - $24.70, up $0.21
   Natural Gas (HHUB) -$3.33, up $0.09
   12-Month Natural Gas Futures Strip - $3.65, up $0.06
   1% Residual Oil (on a MMBtu basis) - $3.91, up $0.04
   London Crude Oil - $24.24, down $0.21 (so far this morning)

   1) Energy Stocks Could See Weakness Over Next Month; Present Buying
   Opportunity.
      From a technical analysis standpoint, the oilservice group looks like
      it will trade sideways to down over the next month.  On the
      fundamental analysis side, there are no visible positive catalysts
      expected until July, when we should see: 1) a rollover in API
      inventories, 2) lower natural gas injections with warmer weather, and
      3) further evidence of natural gas supply declines in second quarter
      natural gas production data.
      While the oil markets have typically seen builds in total petroleum
      inventories into July, it has experienced larger-than-expected builds
      over the past few weeks.  The energy market is likely to view this as
      a very bearish sign.
      We should note that a possible contributor to these abnormal builds
      is that Iraq was exporting as much oil as possible 45 days ago before
      it cut off April/May exports in protest to the U.S. and Israel.
      Bottom line: The charts and fundamentals suggest we could continue to
      see some weakness in both oil prices and energy stocks over the next
      4 weeks.  Based upon strong longer-term (6 to 9 month) fundamentals,
      however, we believe investors should take advantage of any potential
      weakness over the next month and buy the stocks in anticipation of
      meaningful year-end upside.

   2) The API reported that total petroleum inventories increased 8.3
   MMBbls, to 669.0 MMBbls for the week ended May 31, 2002.
      The average consensus range called for a 0.5 MMBbl draw to a 0.8
      MMBbl build in total inventories.  This build in total inventories is
      very bearish for the oil market.
      Total inventories built largely as a result of much higher crude
      supplies, as well as greater distillate supplies.
      Total petroleum inventories are currently 27.2 MMBbls (~4%) above
      levels one year ago, and continues to climb above the five-year
      average.
      Motor gasoline inventories decreased by 0.8 MMBbls to 217.7 MMBbls
      last week, and are now 8.3 MMBbls above last year at this time.
      Distillate fuel inventories rose by 2.8 MMBbls to 127.2 MMBbls last
      week.  Distillate inventories are now 20.0 MMBbls above last year at
      this time.
      U.S. refinery operations were at a 93.4% utilization rate, which was
      1.1% higher than last week's 92.3% rate, and much higher than
      expectations of an ~0.25% increase.  Total petroleum imports
      decreased slightly to 11.8 MMBbls/day.

   OILSERVICE
   3) Nabors' Re-incorporation Receives Independent Shareholder Group
   Endorsement
      Nabors Industries (AMEX:NBR/$40.00/Strong Buy) announced that
      Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Nabors
      shareholder vote in favor of the re-incorporation in Bermuda.  ISS is
      the leading independent provider of proxy analysis and voting
      advisory services.
      Yesterday, Nabors' Chairman and CEO Gene Isenberg repeated his belief
      that the proposed re-incorporation will result in significant tax
      savings and other long-term benefits for the Company that will
      outweigh the one-time capital gains taxes that investors will have to
      pay if the move is approved.
      A lawsuit that has been filed to try to block the vote appears to be
      innocuous, as it is not even on the court docket for a scheduling
      hearing until September and no motions for injunction have been filed
      yet.
      A special stockholders meeting to vote on the re-incorporation has
      been scheduled for June 14(superscript: th).  We currently expect
      that the proposal will pass the shareholder vote.

      E&P

   4) Spring Fire Stops Short of Evergreen Resources'
   (NYSE:EVG/$43.90/Strong Buy) Coal Bed Methane Operations in Southern
   Colorado.

   ?       Evergreen reported that the Spring fire in southern Colorado's
   Las Animas County did not reach the company's coal bed methane
   operations in the Raton Basin.

   ?      The fire crossed into Evergreen's acreage but stopped one and a
   half miles short of the company's nearest well location.

   ?      As a precaution, Evergreen shut-in 69 gas wells in the Lorencito
   Canyon area.  These wells were producing at a combined rate of 6.2
   million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day prior to being shut-in at
   approximately 5:00 p.m. (MDT), Sunday, June 2.

   ?      This daily production rate represents approximately 5% of
   Evergreen's current total gross sales of 124 MMcf of gas per day.

   ?      Production from the Lorencito Canyon area was brought back on
   line yesterday at about 1:00 p.m. (MDT) and is expected to reach its
   prior average rate within the next several days.

   ?      According to latest reports, the Spring fire is mostly contained.
   Evergreen has made its produced water available to assist fire-fighting
   efforts in the area, and  does not expect future curtailments of its
   production unless weather and fire conditions change significantly.

   5) ONEOK (NYSE:OKE/$20.78/NR) Sells Equity Interest in Magnum Hunter
   Resources (Amex:MHR/$7.31/Buy).
   ?       ONEOK announced it has sold its remaining equity interest in
   MHR, representing 4.9 million shares (~7%) of Magnum Hunter's 70 million
   shares outstanding.

   ?      The $35.8 million proceeds from this sale will be used to reduce
   ONEOK's outstanding commercial paper.
   ?      ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified energy company involved primarily in
   oil and gas production, natural gas processing, gathering, storage and
   transmission in the mid-continent areas of the United States.

   6) Vintage Petroleum (NYSE:VPI/$11.65/Buy) Reiterates Commitment to
   Business Plan and Reduction Of Indebtedness; Rejects Restructuring
   Proposal.

   ?       VPI believes that its current depressed stock price is
   attributable primarily to its position in Argentina, which has
   experienced a series of economic and political shocks, and Vintage's
   relatively high leverage, which the company is committed to reducing.

   ?      Vintage recently announced several initiatives to reduce
   leverage, including the intention to reduce the Company's aggregate
   indebtedness by $200 million by year-end 2002 through a combination of
   the sale of non-core assets and cash flow in excess of planned capital
   expenditures

   ?      In response to the BP Capital Energy Restructuring Plan submitted
   on May 15, Vintage said that it has reviewed the plan, and concluded
   that it is not appropriate for the Company to pursue.  BP Capital
   currently owns ~8.9% of the outstanding Vintage common stock.

   ?      The restructuring proposal calls for the liquidation of Vintage's
   North American assets, creating a pure-play Latin American exploration
   and production company.

   7) Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC/$49.88/Market Perform)
   Apparent Winner On 34 Tracts in National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Lease.

   ?       Anadarko announced that it was the apparent high bidder on a
   total of 34 tracts in Monday's National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Oil and
   Gas Lease Sale 2002.

   ?      Anadarko and its partner, Phillips Alaska Inc., submitted winning
   bids representing a combined total investment of $9.6 million ($2.7
   million net to Anadarko).

   ?      The 34 tracts cover more than 282,000 gross acres and are located
   primarily west of the companies' Moose's Tooth discovery.

   ?      With this sale -- the second since the federal government resumed
   leasing in the reserve in 1999 -- Anadarko's leasehold in NPR-A will
   total 277,500 net acres.

Well, you never know...
Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and
family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company
buried in my ""in box"". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz
mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying ""thanks"".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.

   Thursday 2/21/02
   Raymond James Energy Daily Update

   FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

   Energy Price Summary (Close Wednesday 2/20/02):
   Oil (WTI) - $20.29, down $0.59
   12-Month Oil Futures Strip - $20.63, down $0.52
   Natural Gas (HHUB) -$2.39, down $0.01
   12-Month Natural Gas Futures Strip - $2.75, unchanged
   1% Residual Oil (on a Mcf basis) - $2.55, up $0.03
   London Crude Oil - $20.20, up $0.34 (so far this morning)

   1) AGA reports in-line injection, gas prices surge show strength on cold
   weather forecast/short covering
      Last week, 112 Bcf was withdrawn from storage, compared to 81 Bcf
      last year and expectations for a 115-120 Bcf withdrawal.
      Total storage is now 1,944 Bcf, which is 960 above last year.
      This week's report showed 4-5 Bcf/d less gas available for storage
      relative to last year on a weather-adjusted basis.
      The near-month (March) futures contract showed some strength this
      week, after the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted
      colder-than-normal weather in several key consuming regions during
      the next 2 weeks.  Additionally, short covering by traders probably
      added to the positive momentum.  The contract traded as high as
      $2.46/MMBtu this week, before slipping to $2.40/MMBtu after the AGA's
      report.
      To reach 1,500 Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional
      withdrawal season, approximately 74 Bcf/week would have to be pulled
      from storage on average over the last six weeks.  This compares to
      approximately 56 Bcf/week withdrawn during the same period last year
      under normal temperatures.  As a result, of the NWS's forecast is
      accurate, we could still hit the 1,500 Bcf mark.  However, if weather
      remains 15-20% warmer than normal, the probability of withdrawing
      that much gas decreases substantially.
      Longer-term, we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals
      will be a supply driven equation.  Based on fourth quarter production
      volumes reported so far, it appears that U.S. natural gas production
      will, in fact, show both sequential and year-to-year declines.
      Despite the potential for near-term weakness in prices, we remain
      bullish on the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for natural
      gas.


   2) The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that total petroleum
   inventories decreased 5.5 MMBbls to 673.6 MMBbls for the week ended
   February 15, 2002.

   ?       The consensus range called for a 0.7 MMBbl build to a 2.4 MMBbl
   build.  This is a bullish report for the oil market.  Total petroleum
   inventories are currently 73.5 MMBbls (~12%) above levels one year ago.

   ?       Crude oil inventories decreased 4.5 MMBbls to 316.2 MMBbls last
   week.  Crude oil inventories are 37.5 MMBbls above last year at this
   time.  Based on our current U.S. crude oil demand estimate, there are
   approximately 17 days of crude oil inventory.
      Motor gasoline inventories increased 0.6 MMBbl to 218.2 MMBbls last
      week.  Motor gasoline inventories are 13.0 MMBbls above last year at
      this time.

   ?       Distillate fuel inventories decreased 1.6 MMBbls to 139.2 MMBbls
   last week.  Distillate inventories are 23.0 MMBbls above last year at
   this time.

   ?       U.S. refinery operations were at a 88.5% utilization rate, which
   was 0.7% higher than last week's 87.8% rate.  Total Petroleum imports
   decreased to 10.4 MMBbls/day.
      Despite last week's larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum
      inventories, the slowdown in U.S. economic growth that was
      exacerbated by the September 11 terrorist attacks has continued to
      weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well
      above our 5-year average.


   OILSERVICE

   3) BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition.
   ?       Yesterday, BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$30.03/Strong Buy) announced
   that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA, Inc.
   (NASDAQ:OSCA/$27.65) for $28 per share (a 27% premium to the
   pre-announcement stock price).  This all-cash deal equates to a total
   purchase price of roughly $420 million and is expected to close by the
   end of the second calendar quarter.

   ?       OSCA provides a full array of completion-related products and
   services, including completion fluids, completion tools and completion
   services.  BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental
   products, services and markets across its existing asset and customer
   base to yield significant pull-through revenue opportunities down the
   road.  While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA, the
   combination makes a lot of strategic sense.

   ?       Following the announced acquisition, we are making slight
   modifications to our near-term estimates.  Specifically, we are shaving
   a nickel from our existing FY2002 estimate, bringing it down to $1.25
   per share.  This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition
   without significant near-term cost savings or pull through benefits.  As
   management indicated on its conference call, it expects the deal to be
   accretive to the FY2003 consensus of $1.85 per share by $0.06 to $0.07
   per share.  Since we are already in print at $2.00, we are leaving our
   FY2003 estimates unchanged in order to be conservative.  Given the
   expected slight accretion to FY2003 earnings, combined with potential
   longer-term upside and an improving market outlook, we are maintaining
   our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37 per share.

   4) Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely
   undervalued relative to its peers!
      Following yesterday's acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services, it is even
      more clear now that Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI/$23.62/Strong Buy)
      is cheap.
      Specifically, OSCA was purchased for between 30-35x 2003 EPS, or
      12-14x 2003 EBITDA.
      If we apply those multiples to TTI, we come up with a value of $45 to
      $55 per share, as opposed to the current price of $23.62 per share.
      The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA, only perhaps not as
      well known.
      Following OSCA's acquisition, there remains a chance that TTI could
      be taken out at some point in time (although we have no reason to
      believe it will be soon).
      Furthermore, TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of
      this transaction.
      Finally, the company reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.35 per share,
      a penny above consensus.  It will host a conference call today at
      10:30am ET.  The dial in number is 800-860-2442.

   5) Unit Corp. handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations
   ?       Unit Corp. (NYSE:UNT/$12.60/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter
   earnings of $0.27 per share, compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth
   quarter of 2000.  This result was $0.04 ahead of the consensus estimate
   of $0.23 per share.

   ?       Revenues for the quarter came in at $49.3 million, down
   approximately 25% from last year and down 28% from the third quarter.
   Likewise, overall operating margins were down over 530 basis points
   year-to-year to about 50%, while they were also down a like amount on a
   sequential basis.

   ?       The strong quarterly results were largely a result of
   stronger-than-expected dayrates, utilization and margins during the
   quarter.  In fact, average dayrates were down by only about $800 to just
   under $10,200 per day.  Meanwhile, average realized oil and natural gas
   prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with
   declines on a year-to-year basis of 41% for oil and 61% for gas.
   Production volumes also decreased from last year by 2% for oil and 15%
   for natural gas.

   ?       Despite the generally strong results, drilling activity has
   fallen dramatically over the past couple months.  This drop in overall
   rig activity has had a significant impact on Unit's utilization,
   dropping from a quarterly average of nearly 71% rigs in Q4 to the
   current run-rate of 60%, pulling dayrates down another 10-15% currently.

   ?       Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and
   production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates,
   utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our
   quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates.  Accordingly, we
   are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003
   estimate of $1.40 per share.  Despite the lack of near-term visibility,
   the improving long-term outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy
   rating with a 12-month target price of $18 per share (based on a blended
   average of three valuation techniques).

   6) Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss
      Conrad Industries (NASDAQ:CNRD/$4.10/Strong Buy) reported its fourth
      quarter of a loss of $0.02 per share, compared to a profit of $0.10
      per share in the fourth quarter of 2000.  This results missed the
      consensus estimate by $0.14 per share.
      Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11%
      from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter.  The
      gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis
      points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points
      sequentially.
      The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the
      fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.
      The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the
      economy and offshore oil and gas industry.
      The Company will host a conference call at 10:30am ET this morning.
      You may access the call by dialing 800-966-6502.  A replay will be
      available by dialing 800-677-6200 and using access code 2280.

   E&P

   7) AEC Beats 4Q Expectations, EnCana Merger On Track
      AEC (NYSE:AOG/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter 2001 EPS of C$0.55
      per share, which was ahead of our estimate of C$0.40 per share.
      AEC achieved record sales averaging 356,000 Boe/d, up 20% from 2000.
      Each of the three growth platforms - Canada, the U.S. Rockies and
      Ecuador - set new records.
      In 2001, AEC's established conventional reserves rose by 15% to
      nearly 6 Tcf of gas and more than 600 million Bbls of oil and natural
      gas liquids. The Company replaced 276% of 2001 conventional sales,
      with 89% of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit. The
      largest reserve additions were in the U.S. Rockies and northeast
      British Columbia.
      The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholder's
      meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly
      thereafter.
      Alberta Energy's merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will
      create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in
      the industry with a C$27 billion enterprise value and visible
      production growth in excess of 14% annually for at least the next
      five years. The combined company will have a dominant position in
      North America with interests in western Canada, the U.S. Rockies,
      offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 23 million
      undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern
      Colorado to Alaska.  EnCana will also have large international growth
      engines in Ecuador and the North Sea.
      Our target price of C$80 (US$52) is based on a 6.1x multiple of 2002
      cash flow, a valuation comparable to that of its super independent
      peers.  We reiterate our Strong Buy rating.

   8) Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected 4Q Results, Reduces Capital Budget
   for '02.
      Pure Resources (NYSE:PRS/$19.90/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
      $0.00 per share, which was significantly higher than our estimate of
      a loss of ($0.17) and the consensus estimate of ($0.13).
      PRS's production during 4Q:01 totaled 390 Mmcfe/d, up 70% from the
      same period last year, including acquisitions made during 2001,  and
      up 85% for the full year.  However, the company lowered 2002 volume
      guidance from 12% growth to 9% growth based on a reduced capital
      spending program.  As a result, we have lowered our 2002 earnings
      estimate from $0.32 to $0.31 per share to reflect the reduced
      expectations.
      Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of $1.12
      and $6.30, respectively, based on 11% production growth from 2002 to
      2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
      of oil.
      The Company replaced 385% of its production from all sources at a
      cost of $1.82/Mcfe, and increased its total reserves by 34% to 1,469
      Bcfe.
      We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on shares of Pure.  Through
      experience, operational focus and the application of newer
      technology, Pure has the opportunity to create significant value in
      the ""mature"" Permian Basin.  Our target price of $24 is based on a
      5.3x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified by the
      Company's geographical focus and operating leverage in the Permian
      Basin.

   9) XTO 4Q Results In-Line With Expectations.
   ?       XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO/$17.10/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
   $0.42, which was in-line with our estimate of $0.41 and consensus of
   $0.40.

   ?       XTO's production during 4Q:01 totaled 565 Mmcfe/d, up 20% from
   the same period last year and up 17% for the full year.

   ?       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of
   $2.19 and $5.27, respectively, based on 12% production growth from 2002
   to 2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
   of oil.

   ?       During the conference call, XTO mentioned that it may make an
   acquisition in lieu of a portion of its organic production growth
   through the drillbit.  More specifically, XTO may forego a portion of
   its East Texas drilling budget and use $100-150 million towards an
   acquisition.  Either way, XTO is expected to achieve its 17-20%
   production growth target.

   ?       XTO has a multi-year inventory of development opportunities in
   the low-F&D cost Arkoma and San Juan Basins, as well as the East Texas
   Freestone and Bossier Trends.  For an E&P company, XTO has a
   large/diverse asset base, substantial project inventory, and multiple
   productive zones in its core producing areas.  We are maintaining our
   Strong Buy rating on shares of XTO based on the company's ability to
   generate consistent double-digit production growth.  Our target price of
   $24 is based on a 6.5x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified
   by the company's consistent and visible growth.

By the way, I'm still looking to get out to KC this weekend, but I can't

"","T
he first detailed allegations that Enron
abused mark-to-market accounting to
hide wholesale trading losses have
emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided
by a professor and former deriva-tives
trader who reviewed the Enron case
for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.
Those charges, along with allega-tions
that have surfaced that mark-to-market
accounting was misused by Enron
Energy Services, the company's retail
energy and services unit, are expected to
support the push by accounting rulemak-ers
for much more disclosure on mark-to-market
accounting practices and the
impact of mark-to-market accounting on
earnings trading firms' earnings.
In testimony Thursday before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
last week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-ty
of San Diego Law School, said it
appears that Enron traders mismarked
forward curves and manipulated the
amount of profits and losses that would
be reported in financial statements.
""In a nutshell, it appears that some
Enron employees used dummy accounts
and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate
false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives
Enron traded,"" said Partnoy, who
reviewed the case over several weeks at the
committee's request. ""It appears that Enron
traders selectively mismarked their forward
curves, typically in order to hide losses.""
""Traders are compensated based on
their profits,"" he observed, ""so if a trader
can hide losses by mismarking forward
curves, he or she is likely to receive a
larger bonus.""
Partnoy said mismarking forward
curves was not the only problem.
""For each trade,"" he testified, ""a
trader would report either a profit or loss,
typically in spreadsheet format. These
profit-and-loss reports were designed to
reflect economic reality. Frequently they
did not. Instead of recording the entire
profit for a trade in one column, some
traders reportedly split the profit from a
trade into two columns. The first column
reflected the portion of the actual profits
the trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent
financial statements. The second col-umn,
ironically labeled the 'prudency'
reserve, included the remainder.""
Partnoy told the committee that in
his estimation, ""Enron's 'prudency'
reserves did not depict economic reality,
nor could they have been intended to do
so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund
that could be used to smooth out profits
and losses over time. The portion of prof-its
recorded as 'prudency' could be used
to offset any future losses,"" he said.
He recommended that investigators
question Enron employees who were
involved in these transactions ""to get a sense
of whether my summaries are complete.""

Subject: Enemy Lawyers Struck Down Once Again


The Lord works in wonderful ways.
My dear opposing counsel failed to appear at docket call this morning for 
our December 3rd, 2001 trial setting on the case you have heard me talk 
about so much.
The court dismissed their case for want of prosecution on the spot for no 
showing. While they have 30 days to try to get the case reinstated, the 
bottom line is that I will not have trial looming over my head while we hunt 
and you will not have to listen to me drone on about this ridiculous case 
(unless you want me to and at least for now).
Sincerely, Lawyer Boy.

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander, 
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

Joe,
I spoke with Centana's attorney. According to him, they are not opposed
to the escrow account, just the hassle of paper work, but he is checking
with his commercial person and will get back to me today. I told him ENA
wants to do the deal, ENA is willing to open the escrow account, but
that's the deal. So I expect to hear from him shortly.

Attached is the email from Centana's attorney. At the very beginning of
Mike Richards' email he lists all of his claims.

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.  

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be
delivered to Enron North America.

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

Subject:	Bridgeline Working Gas

Spoke with Joe Parks this p.m.  Bridgeline will require gas retention to cover December and January storage and transport fees (approx. $1.32 million).  Assuming a $2.35 fixed price for the gas, we should be able to liquidate a little better than 1 Bcf.  It will take (at most) 9 days to withdrawal given our firm withdrawal rights of 150,000 MMBtu/d.  The storage contract has interruptible withdrawal rights above this, but any withdrawals above 150,000 MMBtu will be on a best efforts basis.

Our highest net back will probably be Henry Hub; however, ENA's Transport Agreement only allows 55,000 firm delivery rights to HH...everything else will be on a secondary basis, which carries a lower priority of service in the event the pipeline restricts flows to HH.   Joe mentioned that Bridgeline may be willing to purchase the gas in ground.  Once we get the go ahead to sell, it will be a matter of  determining the best price to ENA.  The transport and storage does not appear to carry any incremental charges to move it across the Bridgeline system, since we will be reserving gas for January transport fees.  Therefore, we will look to the highest offer on the system.

Joe reminded me of a Bridgeline issue you addressed in an earlier e-mail which stated ""he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald.""  

Questions:
1. Do you know where Gerald sits in relation to this matter?
2. Do we have to go to the BMC / Cash Committee, etc...to transact?

Let me know.

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice, we
can steal some of Henry's.

No, I can set you up on the web this afternoon and we can call this next
week your free trial!

I'll send info to our web support right now. It should be up late this
afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Let's do this:

Please use all lower case, since it will be cap-sensitive.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll have someone checking my e-mail

Greg,

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the
noon update, 1 page.  I also had a question, does this package include the
forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need
clarification on that.


Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks very much.

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
nummber is 832-851-2806.


Thanks

Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca 
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him 
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,
we 
can steal some of Henry's.

Joe, the EES book data is getting closer to what we need but not there yet. 

Please discuss w/ EES Risk (Scott Mills?): 
1) The Price (NG) positions are expressed in PV'd quantity.  We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  

2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis. 

Maria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.

Please set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)  As you commented, we need to determine that we agree with the methodology and conversion factor prior to including basis in the hedge quantity.

Thanks

Attached is the information that we discussed last evening. 

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index. 
        The tabs that indicate ""OXY II Only"" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.

        The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity. 

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

Subject:	Centana

Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost on pre-petition retainage?

sitara numbers for ponderosa
 
Ed,
    Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. 
 
 Duke/Centana 
  Money wires will be complete on April 1.  The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1.  I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 
Ponderosa Energy Partners
 I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant.   I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where  I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over.
 
Pace Energy
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000.
 
General Land Office.
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal dealsheet for the natural gas volumes.

Men:

The dreaded time has come. Rent goes up and it is a month earlier.
The initial $8,000 payment is due to Mertz on March 1, 2002.

In addition, I paid Mertz $500 for the protien that he fed during the last 
hunting season.

I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42. Send to 815 walker, 
suite 1447, H/T 77002. Thank you.

"RE: Retail Gas Book / Business","Louis, I, for now, have requested wholesale basis positions(price equivalent) be keep out of the price report. Further I have requested a seperate basis report that will show similiar information contained in the price report. I would like to look at basis correlations before including them in fixed price.

Attached please find an additional file which shows all the Nymex and basis positions for EES by region by forward month. These need to be evaluated carefully before being used as a basis for hedging due to the changing nature of our portfolios. Call me if you have any questions.

Subject:	FW: Retail Gas Book / Business

To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed

	I've asked Joe to look for a market & get me a notional price.  If we have gas it will be

Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?
 
If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.
 
Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?
 
Chad, the time in the ""stall"" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be

Subject: Lease Update



Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the 
Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next 
morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed 
that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to 
fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have 
lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

1 star hangover (*)

No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco
nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy.  Be glad that you
are able to function relatively well.   However,you are still parched. You
can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way.  You are craving a steak bomb
and a side of gravy fries.



2 star hangover (**)

No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only acerbating
your
rumbling gut, which is craving a rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake
breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.



3 star hangover (***)

Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive.
Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the
random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd
your ass at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your
bed
with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub You've had 4 cups of coffee, a
gallon
of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.



4 star hangover (****)

Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else
you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and
given
you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,but that can't
hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls,it
looks
like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars). Your eyes look
like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76.



5 star hangover(*****)

a.k.a. ""Dante's 4th Circle of Hell."" You have a second heartbeat inyour
head
which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the nextcube.  Vodka
vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have
toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth.
Your
body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating
you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who
you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger
still sleeping in your bed at your house.



6 star hangover (******)

Otherwise known as the ""Infinite Nutsmacker""You wake up on your bathroom
floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool
refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your vomit from 5
hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate who was as drunk as you, but
somehow manages to get up before you the next morning...You try to lift
your
head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to
smell
the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize
you were smoking, but not ultra lights... some jackass handed you Marlboro
reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look
in
the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp ""Ready to Rock"" faintly atop
your forehead... that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has
magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to
work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think
of wearing is your ""hello kitty"" pajamas.....

Joe,

Attached is link for Financial Trading position.  Job descriptions may not match precisely with your position as it exists today, but that is OK.  We have tried to be as broad as possible in describing the open positions to minimize the number of posting links. Your job will not change, and your offer will be made for the position and duties you are performing now.  The posting requirement is by end of day on Monday, even though this link says by Friday.  You can access the link from the internet at the office or at home.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Daily Market Commentary October 25, 2001

TRADERS SKEWER ENRON . . .

 Natural gas futures retreated in busy trading Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Much of the volatility was the result of trade and commercial accounts seeking to profit from a perception of market weakness by a prominent trade and commercial account. Other trade and commercial players bid the cash market higher with the intent of forcing liquidation of underwater short positions. Today's activity is not seen as significant in the determination of longer term price trends, and short term traders see the market working higher. . .
 
 At the end of the day, the November futures fell $.043 to $2.938 per MMBtu. The December contract eased $.068 to $3.103 per MMBtu. . .

 ""This was called the 'get Enron day'. Many customers said that Enron was short the market and at first traders ran the cash market higher. For a while the cash market was ahead of the futures by as much as 10 cents, and as soon as the gap was (partially) filled on the December charts at $3.25 to $3.30 (August 24), the bottom dropped out and when prices fell below unchanged, it got ugly,"" said a New York floor trader. . .

 ""Basically Enron was taken to the cleaners. Traders knew that Enron had to get out of positions. There was talk of funds needed to pay an SEC fine, and
traders took advantage of that."" . .

 ""There was no sympathy for Enron anywhere. Traders knew they had them on the run."" . . 

 ""I believe if prices can hold the $2.80 to $2.82 in the November, the best
plan is to come back and buy again,"" he said. . .

 ""The activity today was just a 'get Enron' tactic. Other traders were hearing the same thing from their customers.""

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 3/25/2002.

With the recent surge in U.S. natural gas prices many analysts are
scratching their heads in disbelief. Of course there will continue to be
volatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only
sustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what
happened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that
U.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter
than the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the
extent of this tightness, as more ""normal"" weather over the past several
weeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang.
This shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into
the early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas
injections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be
the bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.

Next week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary
numbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to
surprise many on the Street. Stay tuned....

"Centana Storage","I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage. They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with Duke/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?

Has anyone figured out who Erik talked to Friday afternoon...apparently
he had a conversation with a person who he thought was me...you know,
typical ""man"" talk. I called him and asked him where he was (lots of
noise in the background, beer bottles clinking, women hootin' and
hollerin', etc.). His reply was, ""Whaddayamean...I'm at the same place
as the last time you asked me that."" (Bar) I said , Erik, I havent
talked to you all day> He said, ""Really...well I had a conversation for
about 10 minutes with someone I thought was you about an hour ago"".
Nope, wasnt me!!! ""I guess it was Chad, then. With all this noise (Bar),
It is difficult to hear (that combined with apparent beer drinking,
added to his confusion) I called Chad moments later to find out what the
conversation between Erik and ""I"" was....he verified, as well, that he
had not talked to him, either!!!
	Now, this is funny. Can you imagine what the conversation was
like for the poor bastard on the other end of the line who E thought was
me? 
Example...Pig references, references to drinking, large breasted bar
""ho's"", shooting and eating things, snide, disparaging remarks intended
to disempower, and large amounts of colorful metaphors. 
	I certainly hope that Erik was talking to one of us, and not
some prospective client or business associate. This could be a SNL skit,
if done correctly!!!
Pretty damn funny....

Had a nice weekend with the family down at KC.
Wrapped up a deposition in San Antonio at at about 1, eat and headed to
KC. 
Arrived at about 4. shot limit at 100 acres. Not alot of birds, but
enough. 
Birds very wise. Had to hide well. Lots of birds across the road feeding
in 
the field, lots hanging out on wire. few moving over our ponds.
Saw lots of coyotes. 4 at 100acres, two at 500.
heavy rain at 7 pm. cool front.
Sheila came down with boys on sat. caught a few fish at 100 acres, shot
7 
birds. Suprised many still in area with rain and north wind. Harder to
hide 
with two wiggling boys.
Never got to scout 500 acres, by mark hunted it last weekend according
to 
his note and shot only two birds. I saw a decent number in the area of 
between our gate and road to Opiela's house. The field across the road
from 
the front gate is stacked with sunfowers. They have not dropped seed
yet, 
still yellow. in a week or so, could draw birds. still lots feeding
across 
road from 100 acres.
John, saw a few deer tracks around your feeders, and lots of really big
pig 
tracks.
If someone is going down in the next two weeks, please let me know. I
left a

pistol at the house, Ms. Opiela went over and got it for me. She will
hold 
onto it until I can get some one to pick it up.

FYI

Joe Parks just completed the sale of the gas in storage at the Centana Facility.  Below you will see confirmation of our receipt of the sales price.  Joe will send to me (and I can forward to any interested party) the methodology for the sales price calculation.  Of this amount, approximately $225,000 will be escrowed (these are for pre-petition obligations under the storage agreement with Centana) subject to some future resolution.  My understanding is that Ed McMichael and his team will be evaluating what to do with the Centana Storage Agreement (accept or reject).

Chip - please put the following transaction in front of the Cash Committee for approval.  As you will recall from your discussions with Stuart Z, this is a self funding transaction where ENA will (1) sell gas in the ground (storage); (2) pay post-petition storage demand costs; and, (3) put in (third party) escrow the pre-petition amounts until such time as a mutually agreeable arrangement can be reached and the appropriate estate approval for settling pre-petition obligations are received.
 
As more fully described in the attached Batch Funding Request, the net proceeds to the estate will be approx. $1.7 million with funding anticipated in the first week of March.  
 
Call with questions.

By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Stuart

Ed,
    Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. 
 
 Duke/Centana 
  Money wires will be complete on April 1.  The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1.  I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 

[Parks, Joe]  Ponderosa Energy Partners
 I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant.   I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where  I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over.
 
Pace Energy
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000.
 
General Land Office.
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal dealsheet for the natural gas volumes.

Cc: Schneider, Chip
Subject: Centana Transaction


Gerald/Chip,

Could you tell me how to proceed on this deal.  This differs a bit from the deal that was originally discussed but seems to make sense.  Please disregard the second attachment at it relates to a modification of the Storage Agreement that has not been discussed (and one that we are not willing to make).  Also, the letter as drafted does not contemplate (but we will insist on) placement of the proceeds from the sale of gas associated with pre-petition amounts into escrow with some third party until some resolution is reached on those amounts.

By way of example, if Centana is owed $100k pre-petition, $150k post-petition and has $1,000,000 worth of gas in the ground, Centana would remit (i) $100k to an escrow agent for subsequent resolution and disposition and (ii) $750k to ENA ($900k offset by the $150k for post petition obligations).

The key issue is what level of approval is needed to do this.  A strong case could be made for Cash Committee only because no pre-petition amounts are being paid (and no resolution of those amounts is being reached).  Rather, we are just converting the commodity to cash when the market is higher than it has been over the past several weeks.

Another good reason for doing this is that after the cavern is empty, we can argue that we are not using it and therefore no more post-petition obligations continue to accrue following the consummation of the deal (while we decide to accept or reject).

Please advise at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

Get on the band wagon for soccer:  from the Washington Post.....""Now the 
time is right. Because 1) Soccer fever is sweeping the country like malaria. 
And 2) We can get a short-term lease on a quality vehicle. And that's good, 
considering we're in a single-elimination situation, and we play 83-time 
winner Germany on Friday. Not to put too fine a point on it, but many 
Germans rank soccer behind only ""full scale war"" as the favorite sport of 
the country. (Hey, how about France, huh? Talk about gagging on the fromage! 
Three games, no goals. Au revoir, Pierre. Isn't it just like the French to 
go out early and leave it up to us to beat the Germans?)""

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

"Deals","Ed, 
Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. Who would you like for me to hand these over to?
Duke/Centana 
Money wires will be complete on April 1. The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars.

I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over. I  recommend Chris to help manage this, if that works for you.
Pace Energy 
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000. 
General Land Office. 
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal deal sheet for the natural gas volumes.

I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage. They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with Duke/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?

ChevronTexaco faces tough choices on Dynegy stake 

By Carolyn Koo 

NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - ChevronTexaco Corp. (NYSE: CVX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cvx&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/cvx.html>) faces nothing but unsavory options over its downtrodden investment in Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DNY <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dny&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dny.html>), such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away, or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader. 

	

The deep pockets of the second-largest U.S. oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy, the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes, fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall. 

But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses, or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. (Other OTC: ENRNQ.PK <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=enrnq.pk&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/enrnq.pk.html>) 

""ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place,"" said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock & Co. ""After all this, are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy?"" 

San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a ""vested interest"" in Dynegy's success, but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take. The company owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy, a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November. 

Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as $300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week, even as U.S. and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company. 

Already, Dynegy's credit rating is in danger of falling to ""junk"" levels. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Dynegy's credit rating in on review, while rival credit agency Standard & Poor's has placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch. 

""If Dynegy is downgraded to junk, they'll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco,"" said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse. 

Dynegy shares fell 57 cents, or 5.8 percent, to an almost three-year low of $9.31. ChevronTexaco's stock has not been rocked by the power trading sector's woes. Its shares rose $2.15, or 2.4 percent, to $90.10. 

BOARD'S ROLE 

Dynegy is also the subject of several probes, including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal, ""Project Alpha,"" that cut the company's tax bill by $80 million. Another probe is looking into ""wash trades"" intended solely to boost trading volumes. 

ChevronTexaco's silence since Dynegy's troubles have come to light has worried analysts. 

When credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week, it said it was ""concerned about the lack of any public statement of support"" from ChevronTexaco ""in this period of market tumult"" for Dynegy. 

""If the situation deteriorates, I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy,"" said James Elliot, a portfolio manager with Dominick & Dominick Advisors. 

Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation. Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegy's board, including Chief Financial Officer John Watson. 

""It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing,"" said Gheit. ""I hope not, because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco."" 

He added that bailing out Dynegy ""would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy. The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco ."" 

Chevron acquired the stake in 1996, before its merger with Texaco, when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp. bought Chevron's natural gas business. 

ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming $1.5 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company. It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegy's planned purchase of Enron.
