"RE: Man Night Report","I think Chad imbibed a copious amount of ""contaminated well water"" last night...at least he sounds like it!!!

FYI...I spent the majority of my drive home on the phone with Chad, complaining that someone had stolen my tailgate!!! I couldn't see it in my rear view mirror....in actuality; it was just ""down"".

"Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails","I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?;

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease;

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate;

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not;

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

Subject: Lease Update


Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer
up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in
the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled
the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as
the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the

Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next

morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed

that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to

fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and
4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered
putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to
you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good
schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in
Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased.
30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have

lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the
spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite
and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston
boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed
but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and
closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great
if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

Actually, for the most part I think we are starting to reach a point where we have inputted the majority of what we have.  However, there are still a number of points which we do not have any information on at all like Sonat, Koch, and Florida. Then, of course, many of our points do not go out that far into the future.  Lastly, these additional quotes can make a difference in what the shape of the curves may be.  Thus, what I guess I'm trying to say is that we are reaching a point where we really need to get these additional quotes loaded or at least gain access to them so that we can continue to make progress on the curve validations.   
 
On the east, I am also still working with Chance to get access to Sandra Brawner's revised curves so that we can either load or copy that into the sheets as well.  Once that is done, we can proceed forward with looking at the curves to see if they make sense. 
 
Please keep me posted on what you know about the Truequote progress.  We are at the point where we really need them.
 
Thanks,
 
Kathy

The electronic broker data is coming in various formats and we are in the process of trying to determine if we can automate the loading of the quote data into the templates. So, please continue loading the broker data manually as we work towards finding a better solution.

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

In my conversations with Andy Edling at NGPL, he indicated to me that NGPL is  unwilling to allow us to permanently release ENA storage contracts to a third party. He is  recommending that we work out a capacity release arrangement with a third party.

Subject:	Bridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals

Ed and Gerald,

Brian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14.  During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline.  Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens.  I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had.

Gerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above.

Ed, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.  If not, my guess is that you will be interested in hearing more.

Regards

Stuart

"ENA's position on Bridgeline Storage/Transport","Spoke w/ El Paso's pipeline group this p.m..  They are extremely interested in pursuing discussions.  I did not disclose contract specific details....just explained the benefits of owning a position on Bridgeline.  El Paso believes they already have authority to purchase transport/storage on other pipeline assets through SONAT.  If they are correct, the time period to transact is significantly reduced.  

Do we need to send a letter to Bridgeline to get authority to share contract specific info??? In other words, give direction on how to pursue.

"Centana","Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost on pre-petition retainage?

What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks
again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt.
I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your
spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick

"RE: Prepays to Reliant and Dominion","I purchased the 10,000 dth gas from Reliant for the month.  The $70,000.00 wire needs to be revised to $989,700.00.

Subject:	RE: Prepays to Reliant and Dominion

I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the 
Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next 
morning. 21"" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed 
that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to 
fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have 
lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks
again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt.
I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your
spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick

"RE: Tenaska Service Agreement","The desk has, since September 2000, provided ""agency services"" to the Cleburne, TX facility (owned by Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd., f/k/a Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd., which is owned by ECTMI (10%) and Ponderosa Pine Energy, LLC (90%), or ""PPEP"").  Agency services include gas scheduling/reconciliation, purchase/resale, and billing/payment of services provided under three contracts to which Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners is a party:

Lone Star - transport
Apache - supply
Williams - supply

An agreement covering these services was developed by Sandy Braband (no longer here) and never executed.  The desk received a fee of ~4.5 cents/Dth for the services.
 
Based on my conversations with James Armstrong, it appears that pipeline charges billed by Lone Star between April and September 2001 were billed by the desk to the project.  The project forwarded funds to the desk for payment of the Lone Star invoices, but the funds never went to Lone Star.  The total amount still due Lone Star for the period is $515, 985.41.  As the contract is between Lone Star and PPEP, the amount due must be settled in order to prevent defaults under the project-level loan agreement.  I believe a request has been submitted to you for payment of the total amount due.  My question is can the estate pay the amount due Lone Star or will the project need to remit funds directly to the pipeline and file a claim against the estate (effectively double-paying the amount due)?  To the extent it's the latter, it's the upstream parties (i.e., KBC/Delta Power) that will have an issue with what's happened, as any amounts trapped by the desk (and paid, for a second time, by PPEP) essentially come out of future cash distributions from the project company.
 
FYI, this is not the only issue that has arisen as a result of this arrangement.  According to James, the project company also paid the desk for October 2001 pipeline charges billed by Lone Star and subsequently paid the pipeline directly ($108,405) and is owed $600,377.50 for November 2001 gas sales made on behalf of the project.  We're also aware that a large imbalance has built up on Lone Star; Joe Parks is looking into taking care of this problem while we're determining what DPC/Delta Power wish to do with respect to gas management going forward.
 
Please call me at x3-6027 if you have any questions.

We can try.  The guy who managed this deal for the desk left the Company but I thought he handed it off to Rick Hill in the estate.  I will talk to the rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you.  My basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only and are agent for the plant.  I believe Rick Hill is the commercial contact on the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal.  I will get back to you.

Hey Tom,
Rita Wynne just called and let me know that we need to make a payment to TXU on behalf of Tenaska.  Since TXU has terminated agreements with us, the Cash Management Committee will not make payments to TXU unless they understand the deal that is in place with Tenaska and we show that Tenaska has already paid us their part.  Could you please help Chip Schneider, of Enron Underwriting, and myself get up to speed on this as quickly as possible.  TXU is threatening to take action on Tenaska.  Thanks for your help.

"Board Transition","Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing further progress on the transition of Enron's Board of Directors.  At a Board meeting this morning, the board accepted the resignations of the remaining four long-standing directors, Robert A. Belfer, Norman P. Blake, Dr. Wendy L. Gramm and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr.   The Board also elected Raymond S. Troubh as interim chairman of the board and noted that they have identified three independent director candidates, whose election is pending feedback from the creditors' committee.

These resignations complete the transition to a board made up of new and independent directors.  In addition, we now have a process in place to expand the board further.  We look forward to working with the new board throughout our restructuring efforts, and we will keep you posted on the appointment of new directors.  For more information on today's board action, you can read the press release at:  http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/26-060602Release.html

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

Think this a great idea...he is just the ideal person to have on the lease
and as standup and nice of a guy you would ever want to know. I'd give him a

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

Gentlemen,
 
 
            Please access www.mertzranch.com <http://www.mertzranch.com/> and witness my photographic skills and Joe's obvious hunting skills as a picture of Joe's 9 point is being proudly displayed on Michael's web-site!!!! Methinks using Joe's deer and my photographical skills as a shameless plug for Michaels ever expanding  Outfitting Monopoly?.should grant us (hunter and photographer) certain royalties normally associated with this sort of unlicensed usage of this form of media. Basically, we need a price break for use of picture!!!! Anyway, pretty cool seeing your very own photo displayed on a website!!!!
 
                                                                                                                                    PIGGY

Subject:	Florida swing supplier

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

For VAR 95 using a Delta gamma approach
1.645 * position * price * daily vol = VAR 

Remember daily vol is implied vol divided by sqrt of time or 16 in this case.

Subject: FW: Greenspan Article



      LOS ANGELES--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once again found
 himself in legal trouble Monday, when he and several members of his
extensive entourage were arrested for allegedly destroying a penthouse
suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

      Hotel officials say Greenspan, in town to address an annual
convention of Federal Reserve District Bank presidents, caused an estimated
 $8,500 in damages to the room, the surrounding hallway and the
swimming-pool area.

      Said Beverly Hills Hotel manager Giles Laurent: ""The television
screen and cabinet had apparently been kicked in. Two chairs were thrown
out the window. The mattress was ripped and its stuffing was flung all over
 the room, as well as into the hallway."" Laurent added that minutes before
police arrived, Greenspan, with the help of Deputy Treasury Secretary
Kenneth 
Dam, pushed a vending machine off the balcony overlooking the hotel's
swimming 
pool.

      During his two-day stay at the posh hotel, Greenspan also accumulated
a $781.55 room-service bill, which he has refused to pay until June 1,
when he says interest rates on German 10-year Euro-Bunds will rise to a
more favorable 5.5 percent.

      Witnesses to Greenspan's behavior during the days leading up to
Monday's arrest said the 75-year-old head of the Federal Open Market
Committee was in an unusually volatile mood.

      ""Upon arriving Friday, Mr. Greenspan demanded that four large bowls
of M&Ms be delivered to his room, with all the orange ones removed,""
Beverly Hills Hotel concierge Alexander Poole said. ""Then, when he got to
his room and saw the bowls, he flew into a rage, knocking over lamps and
screaming that he wanted the green M&Ms taken out, not the orange ones.""

      Greenspan got into more trouble Saturday night, when he, Fed
Vice-Chair William J. McDonough and several other members of his inner
circle
visited a trendy L.A. night spot. Clubgoers reported seeing Greenspan, still
high 
off the dollar's rally against the yen last week, shout obscenities and
throw ashtrays 
at the club's DJ. When security personnel attempted to restrain him,
Greenspan became
belligerent, yelling, ""I'm Alan F***ing Greenspan,"" and vowing to put
bouncer Frank Rizzo in a ""hurt bracket."" The incident is already being
compared to his infamous July 1997 fistfight with John Kenneth Galbraith at
 New York's China Club.

<<Greenspan_drunk015.jpg>>

Above: The famous Beverly Hills Hotel, site of the Fed chief's latest brush
 with the law.

      According to Federal Reserve Board insiders, Greenspan, buoyed by the
U.S. economy's recent turn-around has grown increasingly megalomaniacal 
in recent months.

      ""He'll spend hours talking about how he's the greatest economist who
ever lived, how he's 'bigger than Keynes,'"" said one member of the Fed
Board of Governors who wished to remain anonymous. ""Every time he talks 
about single-handedly saving America from potential economic ruin following 
the Sept. 11th tragedy by manipulating interest rates, his bloated ego just
swells 
even more. It's just the sort of irrational exuberance he himself once
warned against.""

      Monday's arrest is only the latest in a long string of legal troubles
for the controversial Greenspan, who has had 22 court dates since becoming
Fed chief in 1987. Economists recall his drunken 1994 appearance on CNN's
Moneyline, during which he unleashed a profanity-laden tirade against
Bureau of Engraving & Printing director Larry Rolufs and punched host Lou
Dobbs when he challenged Greenspan's reluctance to lower interest rates. In
 November 1993, he was arrested after running shirtless through D.C.
traffic while waving a gun. And some world-market watchers believe the
international gold standard has still not recovered from a May 1998
incident in which he allegedly exposed his genitals on the floor of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.

      Greenspan's latest quandary now involves women and minorities.  When
asked
about U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's speech at the Women
Entrepreneurs
Conference on March 19th, Greenspan was overheard saying ""What a waste of
Paul's
time.  Women and business don't go together.  Just look at what Elaine
[Chao, U.S. 
Secretary of Labor] has done for our labor markets.  She's just making my
life hell.  
She's the perfect example of why affirmative action doesn't work.""

How much longer can Greenspan last in his position?  Only time will tell.
But, he's 
looking more and more like a ticking time bomb.

Actually, for the most part I think we are starting to reach a point where we have inputted the majority of what we have.  However, there are still a number of points which we do not have any information on at all like Sonat, Koch, and Florida. Then, of course, many of our points do not go out that far into the future.  Lastly, these additional quotes can make a difference in what the shape of the curves may be.  Thus, what I guess I'm trying to say is that we are reaching a point where we really need to get these additional quotes loaded or at least gain access to them so that we can continue to make progress on the curve validations.   
 
On the east, I am also still working with Chance to get access to Sandra Brawner's revised curves so that we can either load or copy that into the sheets as well.  Once that is done, we can proceed forward with looking at the curves to see if they make sense. 
 
Please keep me posted on what you know about the Truequote progress.  We are at the point where we really need them.
 
Thanks,

The electronic broker data is coming in various formats and we are in the process of trying to determine if we can automate the loading of the quote data into the templates. So, please continue loading the broker data manually as we work towards finding a better solution.

"ENA Storage and Transport on Bridgeline","Gentlemen,

Brian and I just spoke with Trevor M of Bridgeline about their need for cash.  One idea that we discussed is (i) quickly determine the over-secured portion of the 1.9 Bcf in storage, (ii) allow ENA to sell that gas thereby releasing some of the storage capacity, and (iii) allow Bridgeline to sell the remaining storage capacity (to bring cash in the door and to mitigate the estate's liability) until we decide what to do (i.e. accept or reject).  Let's talk about this tomorrow.

Stuart

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

landing nets can also be the difference between the one that got away
and 
that new fishing boat and trailer that momma wants you to buy so you can

take her fishing.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is ""zero-rated""  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject:        Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan 

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, ""Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months"".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?

"Chet and 8th spot on lease","Talked to Chris McComb yesterday assuming Chet was a no way deal. Sniffed 
out what Chris has in mind and politely told him that I concerns about it 
and he needed to go talk to his dad and bro about what they wanted to do. 
Chris proposed that his individual design company buy the spot for business 
use and maybe his friends could shoot a buck under it too and pay him a 
little back. May work I said, but opening weekend would need to be members 
only, he suggested that his friends could alternate coming on opening 
weekend: which I interpreted as Chris fencing spot 8a and 8b for his friends 
Toby and Bobby to pay 1k a piece. I told him that was likely unacceptable, 
to discuss with family and get back to me...

I then called chet to beg one last time and he was receptive. BMC looks to 
be doing better he says. He was going to talk to Molly about it and would 
like to look at how co. does over the next quarter.
Please call and encourage him to commit.

Thanks ,e.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

Subject:	Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien

Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its claim against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged from ""if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas from you"" to ""we are holding the gas till you pay us""  Based on Joe's discussions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to stored gas appears small.

Our most probable options appear to be:

 (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / colorable warehouseman's lien
       (post petition amounts are already approved);
 (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st day order;
 (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC;
 (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if available.

My preference is option (1) as :
	-	option (2) is the most unlikely, 
	-	option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we continue to accrue storage costs, and
	-	option (4) holds significant transaction risk.

Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Funding Request (""BFR"").

Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR?

Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed with (1) above?

the plates and see who has been on the ranch.

He said they are getting rain, would like more, but things look good. They

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

"Centana Storage Arrangement","Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

"Flexible Spending Accounts","Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

Subject: Possible new lease member

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"RE: Bridgeline Transport and Storage","This is good information.  One other thing that wasn't mentioned was the fact that all of the partnership documents are in the name of LRCI (and other wholly owned affiliates of ENA - but not ENA itself), while the storage and transport agreement is in the name of ENA [Gerald - I think this is right].  My guess is that this may further strengthen Mark's belief that the arrangements should not be linked.
 
Based on Mark's conclusion - I would like to get together internally to figure out what should be done on the storage and transport agreement.  It might be in the best interest of the creditors to give Bridgeline a sense that we might be rejecting the agreement so that they can line something else up (thereby mitigating the harm to the partnership and indirectly to ENA as a 40% interest owner).

Mark,  In discussion with Bridgeline Holding LP's bankruptcy counsel today,

he stated that he thought ENA would be unable to reject that storage and

transport contracts with Bridgeline without ENA also rejecting the

Partnership Agreement for Bridgeline.  What are your thoughts on this?

Their counsel's argument was that these long term contracts were part of

the consideration for TEPI to enter into the LP and as such ENA would not

be able to escape the obligations of these contracts and still obtain the

benefits of the LP.

Some background:

Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. was formed in March of 2000 with ENA holding 40%

equity and Texaco Exploration & Production, Inc. holds the other 60%

equity.  Management of the LP is 50/50.  ENA and TEPI both contributed

natural gas pipeline assets located in Louisana into the Partnership.  ENA

entered into a long term storage and transport agreement (the ones you have

seen) at the time of the closing of this deal.  These agreements call for

monthly demand charges.  There is also a letter agreement concerning early

termination of the storage and transport agreements.    The letter states ""

You [ENA] acknowledge and agree that such termination fees are necessary to

induce TEPI to enter into that certain Amended and Restated Limited

Partnership Agreement"".  The letter goes on to set out the specific LDs

payable by ENA to TEPI upon their early termination.

You may need more facts than these.  Let me know if you need more info.

"Woman are evil","The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. ""We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!"" The man said, ""You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife."" The agent said, ""Then you are not the right man for this job.""

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. ""I tried, but I can't kill my wife."" The agent said, ""You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.""

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.""

Moral: Women are evil. Don't mess with them.

"RE: age of joe's deer","I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen that 10 point I shot ""on the hoof"", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out lower jaw for inspection, you would have said ""Damn, that's an old deer."" 
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler formation (9"" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side, the younger one looked like a ""thoroughbread Horse"", while mine looked like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together about what ""formula"" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10 point was ""Mature and on his way down"" while the young one (Same deer that Keith has seen, too) is ""Mature and on his way up"". The last thing I have to say about that was that the ""Young"" deer of the two was definitely the ""dominant"" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my ""ol' bastard"" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to ""pour the Chili"" while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the ""stud"", ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stud, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anything. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and doesn't ""disappear"" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from year to year.

He aged Joes deer at 8.5. We may be underaging alot of these deer on the

Hi Troy

It is a Bank of America account.  
However, the final resting place is not co 1648 account 12855818 but it was since moved to company 364 account # 3000018982 which is an AEP/Hpl account.

Greg has requested that I forward the details of a misdirected wire that El Paso had sent to HPL in error and were unable to retrieve. Greg has attempted on several occasions to contact Lisa Mellencamp in regard to the situation without success. He indicated that if we forwarded the details to your attention you may provide some assistance.

	I have located where El Paso in error sent a wire transfer of $ 154,240 to Houston Pipeline ( based upon my understanding a non bankrupt entity ) instead of AEP on November 26. I spoke to Bryce Baxter, Manager of Settlements as to what could be done to get El Paso their funds. He stated that as a result of the Bankruptcy, Bank of America where the wire transfer was sent, seized the account and has frozen those funds. Bryce also stated that they did not intend to return the funds since they were originally for AEP and AEP owned $ 25M on November 26 and and another $ 45M on December 26. He stated these were the instructions from Lisa Mellencamp in their Legal group. Any thoughts or direction on where to go next?

	Thanks.

"Bridgeline Working Gas","Spoke with Joe Parks this p.m.  Bridgeline will require gas retention to cover December and January storage and transport fees (approx. $1.32 million).  Assuming a $2.35 fixed price for the gas, we should be able to liquidate a little better than 1 Bcf.  It will take (at most) 9 days to withdrawal given our firm withdrawal rights of 150,000 MMBtu/d.  The storage contract has interruptible withdrawal rights above this, but any withdrawals above 150,000 MMBtu will be on a best efforts basis.

Our highest net back will probably be Henry Hub; however, ENA's Transport Agreement only allows 55,000 firm delivery rights to HH...everything else will be on a secondary basis, which carries a lower priority of service in the event the pipeline restricts flows to HH.   Joe mentioned that Bridgeline may be willing to purchase the gas in ground.  Once we get the go ahead to sell, it will be a matter of  determining the best price to ENA.  The transport and storage does not appear to carry any incremental charges to move it across the Bridgeline system, since we will be reserving gas for January transport fees.  Therefore, we will look to the highest offer on the system.

Joe reminded me of a Bridgeline issue you addressed in an earlier e-mail which stated ""he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald.""  

Questions:
1. Do you know where Gerald sits in relation to this matter?
2. Do we have to go to the BMC / Cash Committee, etc...to transact?

Let me know.

"RE: Bridgeline Transport and Storage","Sounds good - I have also tentatively schedule Brian Bierbach of Northern Boarder Partners (Enron MLP) to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 to discuss the potential sale of Bridgeline to Northern Boarder (does this work for you)?.   He is interested and wants to get started on due diligence.
 
The idea is to get the process going now ahead of the March date so that we have a buyer lined up if Chevron exercises the buy/sell provision.  Because Northern Boarder is an affiliate we can work around the confidentiality provisions.

Subject: RE: Bridgeline Transport and Storage


This is good information.  One other thing that wasn't mentioned was the fact that all of the partnership documents are in the name of LRCI (and other wholly owned affiliates of ENA - but not ENA itself), while the storage and transport agreement is in the name of ENA [Gerald - I think this is right].  My guess is that this may further strengthen Mark's belief that the arrangements should not be linked.
 
Based on Mark's conclusion - I would like to get together internally to figure out what should be done on the storage and transport agreement.  It might be in the best interest of the creditors to give Bridgeline a sense that we might be rejecting the agreement so that they can line something else up (thereby mitigating the harm to the partnership and indirectly to ENA as a 40% interest owner).

baed on what i read in your e-mail, these are distinct contracts that would

Mark,  In discussion with Bridgeline Holding LP's bankruptcy counsel today,

he stated that he thought ENA would be unable to reject that storage and

transport contracts with Bridgeline without ENA also rejecting the

Partnership Agreement for Bridgeline.  What are your thoughts on this?

Their counsel's argument was that these long term contracts were part of

the consideration for TEPI to enter into the LP and as such ENA would not

be able to escape the obligations of these contracts and still obtain the

benefits of the LP.

Some background:

Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. was formed in March of 2000 with ENA holding 40%

equity and Texaco Exploration & Production, Inc. holds the other 60%

equity.  Management of the LP is 50/50.  ENA and TEPI both contributed

natural gas pipeline assets located in Louisana into the Partnership.  ENA

entered into a long term storage and transport agreement (the ones you have

seen) at the time of the closing of this deal.  These agreements call for

monthly demand charges.  There is also a letter agreement concerning early

termination of the storage and transport agreements.    The letter states ""

You [ENA] acknowledge and agree that such termination fees are necessary to

induce TEPI to enter into that certain Amended and Restated Limited

Partnership Agreement"".  The letter goes on to set out the specific LDs

payable by ENA to TEPI upon their early termination.

You may need more facts than these.  Let me know if you need more info.

John,
Are you in charge of sign ups? I know you are for commercial types, and I'm trying to figure out who decides how much I get paid in UBS world.  I have meeting with UBS this afternoon to discuss.  If possible, can you intercede for me and help me get more money (signing bonus and bump in salary, maybe even year contract?)..  Flat bid to current salary is very humbling, especially given market opportunities for my skill set.  

I appreciate everything you've done for this organization and if you are unable to intercede, I'll understand.

Thanks,
Frank

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about our
impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT CHANGE,
heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will be
Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO have
security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers
drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining next
to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of like a
good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the natives
eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and Chet, I
would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the non-English
speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

								PIGGY

Not sure what the 20 ""MAN NIGHT"" emails are in my inbox from yesterday, but

Over the past few weeks, we have received numerous requests for information about changes to Enron's business policies and procedures since filing for bankruptcy, so we have developed REORIENTATION.

Agenda items include:
- An update on the Credit Union
- A Legal Overview, including some things you should know about bankruptcy
- Status of the Enron Building, including space management, churns and building services
- A review of Employee Benefits
- A presentation from the Resolution Center
- An update on existing Employee Services
- An overview Employee Self Service, including how to access or change your own employee information

Each session will be held in EB5C2 from 9:00-10:30am, and is limited to 50 participants, so you must RSVP if you would like to attend. The plan is to have one or two morning sessions weekly.

Spoke w/ El Paso's pipeline group this p.m..  They are extremely interested in pursuing discussions.  I did not disclose contract specific details....just explained the benefits of owning a position on Bridgeline.  El Paso believes they already have authority to purchase transport/storage on other pipeline assets through SONAT.  If they are correct, the time period to transact is significantly reduced.  

Do we need to send a letter to Bridgeline to get authority to share contract specific info??? In other words, give direction on how to pursue.

Reuters Company News
ChevronTexaco faces tough choices on Dynegy stake 

By Carolyn Koo 

NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - ChevronTexaco Corp. (NYSE: CVX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cvx&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/cvx.html>) faces nothing but unsavory options over its downtrodden investment in Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DNY <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dny&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dny.html>), such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away, or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader. 

	

The deep pockets of the second-largest U.S. oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy, the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes, fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall. 

But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses, or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. (Other OTC: ENRNQ.PK <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=enrnq.pk&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/enrnq.pk.html>) 

""ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place,"" said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock & Co. ""After all this, are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy?"" 

San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a ""vested interest"" in Dynegy's success, but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take. The company owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy, a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November. 

Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as $300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week, even as U.S. and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company. 

Already, Dynegy's credit rating is in danger of falling to ""junk"" levels. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Dynegy's credit rating in on review, while rival credit agency Standard & Poor's has placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch. 

""If Dynegy is downgraded to junk, they'll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco,"" said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse. 

Dynegy shares fell 57 cents, or 5.8 percent, to an almost three-year low of $9.31. ChevronTexaco's stock has not been rocked by the power trading sector's woes. Its shares rose $2.15, or 2.4 percent, to $90.10. 

BOARD'S ROLE 

Dynegy is also the subject of several probes, including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal, ""Project Alpha,"" that cut the company's tax bill by $80 million. Another probe is looking into ""wash trades"" intended solely to boost trading volumes. 

ChevronTexaco's silence since Dynegy's troubles have come to light has worried analysts. 

When credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week, it said it was ""concerned about the lack of any public statement of support"" from ChevronTexaco ""in this period of market tumult"" for Dynegy. 

""If the situation deteriorates, I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy,"" said James Elliot, a portfolio manager with Dominick & Dominick Advisors. 

Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation. Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegy's board, including Chief Financial Officer John Watson. 

""It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing,"" said Gheit. ""I hope not, because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco."" 

He added that bailing out Dynegy ""would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy. The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco ."" 

Chevron acquired the stake in 1996, before its merger with Texaco, when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp. bought Chevron's natural gas business. 

ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming $1.5 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company. It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegy's planned purchase of Enron.

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be

"Credit Union Changes","What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

1 star hangover (*)

No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco
nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy.  Be glad that you
are able to function relatively well.   However,you are still parched. You
can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way.  You are craving a steak bomb
and a side of gravy fries.



2 star hangover (**)

No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only acerbating
your
rumbling gut, which is craving a rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake
breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.



3 star hangover (***)

Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive.
Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the
random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd
your ass at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your
bed
with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub You've had 4 cups of coffee, a
gallon
of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.



4 star hangover (****)

Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else
you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and
given
you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,but that can't
hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls,it
looks
like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars). Your eyes look
like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76.



5 star hangover(*****)

a.k.a. ""Dante's 4th Circle of Hell."" You have a second heartbeat inyour
head
which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the nextcube.  Vodka
vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have
toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth.
Your
body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating
you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who
you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger
still sleeping in your bed at your house.



6 star hangover (******)

Otherwise known as the ""Infinite Nutsmacker""You wake up on your bathroom
floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool
refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your vomit from 5
hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate who was as drunk as you, but
somehow manages to get up before you the next morning...You try to lift
your
head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to
smell
the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize
you were smoking, but not ultra lights... some jackass handed you Marlboro
reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look
in
the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp ""Ready to Rock"" faintly atop
your forehead... that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has
magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to
work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think
of wearing is your ""hello kitty"" pajamas.....

"RE: LOCATION FOR MAN NIGHT","Oh...LN is back!!! Did you reinjure your back or your knee in a freak skiing accident...or are you OK?

Fishing Report from Plaag outing on Friday...

22 trout...no giant ones, but good solid spring time fish.
All caught on Corkies and Topwaters in the far end of East Bay down by Rollover. Biggest fish was 24"", and the rest were 19"" to 23"". ""Shoulda been here yesterday""...Plaag had a bunch of REALLY big fish located over deep mud/shell out in the middle of the bay that they caught the day before on a really low tide. Friday, the tide was up over a foot from the day before and ""the spot"" was too deep to fish!!! They caught some ridiculous number like 5 fish over 7 lbs and the rest over 5 lbs on Thursday. Oh well...damn fun trip anyway.  Those winter time fish are just plain bigger and stronger than a surf run trout. And they are a lot darker colored...tails almost black. Pretty cool looking stringers!!!

"New Storage and Transportation Contract","As you know, Bridgeline submitted an RFP to the top gas marketing and pipeline companies in North America requesting proposals on a package of bundled transportation and storage capacity.  I am pleased to announce that as a result of that RFP, on Friday May 24th, Bridgeline executed definitive agreements with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC on a three year deal to provide storage and transportation services to be effective June 1, 2002.  This contract, providing 135,000 dt/day of pipeline capacity and 2.25 bcf of storage capacity represents a substantial portion of the new storage and related transportation capacity associated with the new NS#1 storage cavern we are completing at Napoleonville this month.  We are looking forward to the long-term relationship this contract will establish with such a prominent industry player as Duke.

I would like to congratulate Rich and Tiffany in generating and negotiating the terms of this deal and managing the whole RFP process, Georgia for her many hours in developing the appropriate contract language and Trevor in resolving the significant credit terms and many others in their support - all completed and coordinated on a very aggressive schedule.  Now we must effectively move into the support and delivery of these services where all of Bridgeline will have significant impact.  There will be several meetings scheduled shortly to roll out the details of the contracts to the various groups.

With the previously executed storage contracts recently negotiated with Oneok (1 bcf) and Cinergy (1.25 bcf), Bridgeline has made a quick jump on its 2002 storage plan.  These new agreements will generate higher levels of transactions and service requests from term customers and a need for increased diligence, support and communication.  

Thank you for all your efforts and commitment which will continue to drive Bridgeline's success.

"Bridgeline","Per our conversation,

The following is a list of questions pertaining to Bridgeline that need to be answered in order for us to fully evaluate our possible courses of action.  In addition, I have attached an electronic version of a Batch Funding Request which lays out the Bridgeline ownership structure and walks through one of the two transactions with Bridgeline that is currently being contemplated.

1)  We need to understand what the effects might be of terminating the Gas Storage and Transportation Agreements between ENA and Bridgeline (""S&T Agreements"").  Specifically, what is the likely remedy for such a termination? (dissolution of the partnership?  reallocation of profit sharing or voting control?).  We are sending over the relevant documents including the Contribution Agreement and the Side Letter Agreement which stipulates the methodology for calculating damages in the event of termination of these agreements.  Also, we need to consider whether the S&T Agreements will be construed as leases of real property and if so what effects that distinction will have on ENA's ability to reject those agreements as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.;

2)  What can Enron do in order to block or fend off any attempt to purchase our interests in Bridgeline pursuant to the ""buy-sell"" provisions of the Partnership Agreement?  Would filing voluntary petitions in bankruptcy on behalf of the 4 limited partners achieve this result?  Remember, the biggest concern in this area is Enron's inability to counter any purchase proposal with a proposal of its own (given our current lack of access to $);

3)  What rights might Enron have to initiate a termination of the Partnership Agreement?  Could we reject the Contribution Agreement (is it sufficiently executory?)?;

4)  What is the impact of a termination of the Partnership Agreement (i.e. is it reasonable to think that we would get our contributed assets back and return to the status quo?)?;

5)  Should we proceed with the transaction that is proposed in the attached Batch Funding Request (especially the early contribution of the Napoleonville Storage Cavern (which Enron is already obligated to contribute under the Contribution Agreement no later than 7/1/2002))?  We need to recognize that if we are unwilling to do this, Bridgeline will likely lose any interest in proceeding with the remainder of the transaction (resulting in numerous other problems with other counterparties).

We also spoke about your preparing a letter to Texaco in response to their letter (pursuant to which they claim to be the sole member of Bridgeline LLC) and the related Unanimous Consent.  

Also be advised that there is another transaction that is currently being contemplated between Bridgeline and ENA.  ENA, as the holder of both storage and transport rights under the S&T Agreements, has title to approximately 1.9 BCF of gas in Bridgeline's storage.  ENA owes approximately $2.4 million to Bridgeline under the S&T Agreements ($1.2 million is pre-petition and the remainder is post-petition).  Initially, Bridgeline rejected our requests to release the gas in storage so that we could sell it (they claimed that they had a right to do this because they have a common carrier lien on the gas).  We responded by letting them know that we felt they were violating the automatic stay.  They have since agreed to hold only those volumes of gas which are needed to secure ENA's pre-petitions obligations and have told us that they would release approximately 1.5 BCF of gas if we paid the $1.2 million for post-petition amounts.  We do not want to pay these amounts as doing so would be tantamount to acknowledging the common carrier lien.  In other words, if we pay the $1.2 million of post-petition amounts to Bridgeline and later determine that Bridgeline did not have the authority to require payment of those amounts prior to releasing the gas, we have done our creditors a disservice (and will likely never see that $1.2 million again).

Thank you in advance for your efforts and please call ASAP if you need anything else from us in order to fully consider the questions raised above.

There is another list, one that reflects traders bonus.  Rumors were that it was 800K average, 60MM disbursement.  It was ear tagged via Dynegy merger announcement, hence it didn't hit press.

"Re: golf cart","Chris' remarks are true with one wheeled trailers, but still worth a shot.
I am hesitant to blow 800 at Mission for their work.  I think we can shop around for parts and piece this thing together over time---certainly no hurry.

Subject: golf cart
 
Joe, see end of message.

Pig, the cart is in fine shape and has been taken to Austin by Chris and is
being stored at their yard. He advises that it should be retreived promptly,
theft concerns.

Chad and I have been investigating Trailer costs. 400 to 500, unless we get
lucky on a used one and they are scarce and we would still pay 350 for it.

Nobby Tires and lift kit can be done at Mission Equiptment for 800. to do it
ourselves (read chad) will cost at least 500 i guess in parts.

My thoughs. If you are still uncomfortable with transporting in your truck,
then we need to spend the money to get the trailer and drive as is and built
a box on the back. If you think it is ok, then consider spending money to do
tire and suspension job.
I will be in AUstin in a few weeks for depo and will be prepared to bring
unit home in a) purchased trailer b)rented trailer c)pigs truck.
Need to make a decision here.

Joe: Any word on borrowing friends mothers trailer? Any interest in becoming
a part owner? Any chance of being able to borrow Kim's grandfather's big ass
trailer to be pulled by my truck???

Trailer issues per chris, pulling one axle trailer that distance is tricky.
May wobble if load not well balanced. Probably ride better in back of truck
or on longer two axle trailer which will track better.

"Entex Non-payment","Entex is several days overdue on their Nov01 invoice payment to Enron.  I confirmed that the payment has not been received as of COB yesterday (1/23/02).

I spoke with the commercial contact, Royal Edmondson (713-207-3384) this morning.  He was aware that they have not paid and eluded to the fact that Enron has not paid Tennessee's Nov01 transportation and storage invoice, which we are agent for Entex.

I also spoke with Ken Armstrong (713-207-3365) who proposed that Entex would pay Enron the commodity portion of the invoice and pay the transportation charges directly to Tennessee.  I asked him to let me clear that with our attorney so that we didn't do anything to void the agency status.  Ken also said he would consider paying us our full invoice amount if he was convinced that their transportation invoice was paid.

Gerald, please call me ASAP so we can resolve this and receive payment.

"RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT","Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander, 
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn 
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

Report from yesterday...Fished West side of Pelican Island shoreline on point closest to Sand Island  waist deep over shell. Caught 6 on Chart/Orange/blue Top Dog and blue/chart/silver mirrolure. 
LOST THE STAR TOURNEY LEADER TROUT!!!! Blew up on TopDog, got her to hand...I was shaking like a freaking leaf. Made ""the grab"" she exploded out of my hand, threw the hook, and Top Dog lodged in my shirt!!! 2nd 28?plus trout I've lost on that shoreline in 2 years!!! Then, after I quit shaking and what not, I realized I wasn't even ENTERED in the damn tourney, so I am glad I didn't catch her!!! She was every inch of 28 and fat with hardly any spots. Big, old female. Damn I love fishing.

"FW: DYN($15/sh): Additional Detail on Collateral---CORRECTED.","

-----Original Message-----
From: jdietert@simmonsco-intl.com [mailto:jdietert@simmonsco-intl.com]
Sent: Monday, April 29, 2002 12:31 PM
To: Sales_Trading@simmonsco-intl.com
Subject: DYN($15/sh): Additional Detail on Collateral---CORRECTED.


In our earlier note we confused the collateral requirements disclosed in
DYN's 10K.  As stated in the 10K, in the event of trigger, Catlin, LLC and
West Coast Power would require a total of $301MM in collateral.  This is
comprised of $270MM from Catlin (the trigger would require both Moodys &
S&P to downgrade) and $31MM from West Coast Power (which we believe only
requires one agency to downgrade).  These corrections do not change our
total collateral estimate of up to $1B.  This was our mistake and we
apologize for the confusion we have created related to this issue.

Simmons estimates for DYN's collateral requirements:

Assuming one agency downgrades to below investment grade:
Existing Trading book, $300MM (Simmons estimate),
West Coast Power, $31MM (from DYN 10K)
Incremental business, $300MM (Simmons estimate)
Total required-roughly $630MM, assuming one agency downgrades

Assuming BOTH S&P & Moodys downgrade to below investment grade:
Collateral provided above, $630MM
Catlin, LLC, $270MM (from DYN 10K)
Incremental misc. collateral, $100MM (Simmons estimate)
Total required-roughly $1B, assuming both agencies downgrade

******************************************************************************************************************************************
ORIGINAL NOTE:

DYN's 10K (page 27) provides some of the detail in our thinking on
collateral.  Assuming a single downgrade in credit rating, DYN disclosed
that its existing business would require $301MM in collateral (as of
12/31/01) and that West Coast power would require $31MM.  We estimate that
incremental transactions would require an additional $300MM, for a total
collateral requirement of roughly $650MM in the event of a Moodys downgrade
(only).  A downgrade by BOTH Moodys and S&P would trigger an additional
$270MM associated with Catlin, LLC (DYN's Midwest generation financing
vehicle), bring the total collateral to just under $1B.

Ed, here is the document which will be forwarded to Kay Mann for approval routing.

 << File: TerminationDASH.doc >> 

Joe Parks and I talked with Rick Miles at Entex this afternoon.  He agreed to all terms.  We are waiting for them to reply with final concurrence on the $2.05 price/dth for the storage inventory.  

I stated that the early termination is subject to bankruptcy court approval.  That didn't bother Rick too much.  He acknowledged that Entex commercial-side needed their attorney's sign-off as well (but didn't think there would be an issue).

"iBuyit Reorientation Brown Bag Session","
 

Over the past few weeks, we have received numerous requests for information about Enron's iBuyit eProcurement system, both from groups not currently benefiting from iBuyit's cost saving opportunities, and from current users wanting to better understand the new approval processes and procedures since filing for bankruptcy.  In response, we developed iBuyit REORIENTATION.  It's a brown bag session designed for employees to cover the following agenda items:

- An introduction to iBuyit for first-time users and to present the purpose and valuable time/cost saving benefits of the system.
Increased contract compliance and leverage purchasing power.
Reduce procurement time and effort with automated processes.
Control spend through electronic approval routing.
Increased order/coding accuracy.
- A brief demonstration of how easy it is to shop for materials and services using the robust catalog functionality, including demonstration of supplier 	mapping to materials and high-quality images.
- How to request new product additions to the catalog.
- Default data entry by HR org structure.
- Populating other required fields.
- Changes to the workflow and shopping cart approval processes since bankruptcy.
- Discussion on CAO delegation.
- Who to contact for help.
- Who to contact to become a new user.

All of the sessions will be from 11:30am-1:00pm in EB5C2.  To register, please select one of the buttons above.  You will receive an email to confirm your attendance.  Remember, register today, space is limited!

"RE: Florida swing supplier","Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

"RE: Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien","Gerald, 
 
If you haven't heard from Joe on this, please get in touch with him.  
 
Joe - this is a reasonable request given that we need to understand why they feel that they are entitled to hold the gas.  We are not trying to be argumentative but need to understand (and have them articulate a rationale for) why they feel that they can do this.  Once we hear where they are coming from, I think we will be able to get to where everyone wants to go (i.e. settlement and sale of the gas).

Chris,  Can you request that Centana provide us with their lawyers info, so I can contact him.  It is not unreasonable for them to specify the grounds under which they are holding our gas.  They are in violation of the automatic stay is they do not return our gas and I will point this out to their attorney.

Subject:        Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien 

Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its claim against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged from ""if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas from you"" to ""we are holding the gas till you pay us""  Based on Joe's discussions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to stored gas appears small.

Our most probable options appear to be: 

 (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / colorable warehouseman's lien 
       (post petition amounts are already approved); 
 (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st day order; 
 (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC; 
 (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if available. 

My preference is option (1) as : 
        -       option (2) is the most unlikely, 
        -       option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we continue to accrue storage costs, and

        -       option (4) holds significant transaction risk. 

Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Funding Request (""BFR""). 

Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR? 

Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed with (1) above?

   Wednesday 6/5/02
   Raymond James Energy Daily Update

   FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

   Energy Price Summary (Close Tuesday 6/4/02):
   Oil (WTI) - $25.33, up $0.25
   12-Month Oil Futures Strip - $24.70, up $0.21
   Natural Gas (HHUB) -$3.33, up $0.09
   12-Month Natural Gas Futures Strip - $3.65, up $0.06
   1% Residual Oil (on a MMBtu basis) - $3.91, up $0.04
   London Crude Oil - $24.24, down $0.21 (so far this morning)

   1) Energy Stocks Could See Weakness Over Next Month; Present Buying
   Opportunity.
      From a technical analysis standpoint, the oilservice group looks like
      it will trade sideways to down over the next month.  On the
      fundamental analysis side, there are no visible positive catalysts
      expected until July, when we should see: 1) a rollover in API
      inventories, 2) lower natural gas injections with warmer weather, and
      3) further evidence of natural gas supply declines in second quarter
      natural gas production data.
      While the oil markets have typically seen builds in total petroleum
      inventories into July, it has experienced larger-than-expected builds
      over the past few weeks.  The energy market is likely to view this as
      a very bearish sign.
      We should note that a possible contributor to these abnormal builds
      is that Iraq was exporting as much oil as possible 45 days ago before
      it cut off April/May exports in protest to the U.S. and Israel.
      Bottom line: The charts and fundamentals suggest we could continue to
      see some weakness in both oil prices and energy stocks over the next
      4 weeks.  Based upon strong longer-term (6 to 9 month) fundamentals,
      however, we believe investors should take advantage of any potential
      weakness over the next month and buy the stocks in anticipation of
      meaningful year-end upside.

   2) The API reported that total petroleum inventories increased 8.3
   MMBbls, to 669.0 MMBbls for the week ended May 31, 2002.
      The average consensus range called for a 0.5 MMBbl draw to a 0.8
      MMBbl build in total inventories.  This build in total inventories is
      very bearish for the oil market.
      Total inventories built largely as a result of much higher crude
      supplies, as well as greater distillate supplies.
      Total petroleum inventories are currently 27.2 MMBbls (~4%) above
      levels one year ago, and continues to climb above the five-year
      average.
      Motor gasoline inventories decreased by 0.8 MMBbls to 217.7 MMBbls
      last week, and are now 8.3 MMBbls above last year at this time.
      Distillate fuel inventories rose by 2.8 MMBbls to 127.2 MMBbls last
      week.  Distillate inventories are now 20.0 MMBbls above last year at
      this time.
      U.S. refinery operations were at a 93.4% utilization rate, which was
      1.1% higher than last week's 92.3% rate, and much higher than
      expectations of an ~0.25% increase.  Total petroleum imports
      decreased slightly to 11.8 MMBbls/day.

   OILSERVICE
   3) Nabors' Re-incorporation Receives Independent Shareholder Group
   Endorsement
      Nabors Industries (AMEX:NBR/$40.00/Strong Buy) announced that
      Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Nabors
      shareholder vote in favor of the re-incorporation in Bermuda.  ISS is
      the leading independent provider of proxy analysis and voting
      advisory services.
      Yesterday, Nabors' Chairman and CEO Gene Isenberg repeated his belief
      that the proposed re-incorporation will result in significant tax
      savings and other long-term benefits for the Company that will
      outweigh the one-time capital gains taxes that investors will have to
      pay if the move is approved.
      A lawsuit that has been filed to try to block the vote appears to be
      innocuous, as it is not even on the court docket for a scheduling
      hearing until September and no motions for injunction have been filed
      yet.
      A special stockholders meeting to vote on the re-incorporation has
      been scheduled for June 14(superscript: th).  We currently expect
      that the proposal will pass the shareholder vote.

      E&P

   4) Spring Fire Stops Short of Evergreen Resources'
   (NYSE:EVG/$43.90/Strong Buy) Coal Bed Methane Operations in Southern
   Colorado.

   ?       Evergreen reported that the Spring fire in southern Colorado's
   Las Animas County did not reach the company's coal bed methane
   operations in the Raton Basin.

   ?      The fire crossed into Evergreen's acreage but stopped one and a
   half miles short of the company's nearest well location.

   ?      As a precaution, Evergreen shut-in 69 gas wells in the Lorencito
   Canyon area.  These wells were producing at a combined rate of 6.2
   million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day prior to being shut-in at
   approximately 5:00 p.m. (MDT), Sunday, June 2.

   ?      This daily production rate represents approximately 5% of
   Evergreen's current total gross sales of 124 MMcf of gas per day.

   ?      Production from the Lorencito Canyon area was brought back on
   line yesterday at about 1:00 p.m. (MDT) and is expected to reach its
   prior average rate within the next several days.

   ?      According to latest reports, the Spring fire is mostly contained.
   Evergreen has made its produced water available to assist fire-fighting
   efforts in the area, and  does not expect future curtailments of its
   production unless weather and fire conditions change significantly.

   5) ONEOK (NYSE:OKE/$20.78/NR) Sells Equity Interest in Magnum Hunter
   Resources (Amex:MHR/$7.31/Buy).
   ?       ONEOK announced it has sold its remaining equity interest in
   MHR, representing 4.9 million shares (~7%) of Magnum Hunter's 70 million
   shares outstanding.

   ?      The $35.8 million proceeds from this sale will be used to reduce
   ONEOK's outstanding commercial paper.
   ?      ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified energy company involved primarily in
   oil and gas production, natural gas processing, gathering, storage and
   transmission in the mid-continent areas of the United States.

   6) Vintage Petroleum (NYSE:VPI/$11.65/Buy) Reiterates Commitment to
   Business Plan and Reduction Of Indebtedness; Rejects Restructuring
   Proposal.

   ?       VPI believes that its current depressed stock price is
   attributable primarily to its position in Argentina, which has
   experienced a series of economic and political shocks, and Vintage's
   relatively high leverage, which the company is committed to reducing.

   ?      Vintage recently announced several initiatives to reduce
   leverage, including the intention to reduce the Company's aggregate
   indebtedness by $200 million by year-end 2002 through a combination of
   the sale of non-core assets and cash flow in excess of planned capital
   expenditures

   ?      In response to the BP Capital Energy Restructuring Plan submitted
   on May 15, Vintage said that it has reviewed the plan, and concluded
   that it is not appropriate for the Company to pursue.  BP Capital
   currently owns ~8.9% of the outstanding Vintage common stock.

   ?      The restructuring proposal calls for the liquidation of Vintage's
   North American assets, creating a pure-play Latin American exploration
   and production company.

   7) Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC/$49.88/Market Perform)
   Apparent Winner On 34 Tracts in National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Lease.

   ?       Anadarko announced that it was the apparent high bidder on a
   total of 34 tracts in Monday's National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Oil and
   Gas Lease Sale 2002.

   ?      Anadarko and its partner, Phillips Alaska Inc., submitted winning
   bids representing a combined total investment of $9.6 million ($2.7
   million net to Anadarko).

   ?      The 34 tracts cover more than 282,000 gross acres and are located
   primarily west of the companies' Moose's Tooth discovery.

   ?      With this sale -- the second since the federal government resumed
   leasing in the reserve in 1999 -- Anadarko's leasehold in NPR-A will
   total 277,500 net acres.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Subject: report from Keith


Forwarding Kieth's report from last weekend of doe season.

Had to call him to get information on what made his heart race.

He saw Mertz's rib cage buck at boneyard, other side of the fence, said it
was 14 inches wide with tines that were incredibly long almost touching at
the top. he said 140plus, no problem.

saw brian's deer's younger brother at lonestar and said it will be a great
bucknext year.

While spotlighting bunnys saw a buck at the protien feeder at launching pad
that was unbelivable. He said he counted 12 scorable points, not including
several kickers he did not count. the deer was wide with aobut 8 to 9 inch
tines. walked with a limp on front right leg. Must be a nocturnal old
warrior, never seen before.

other than that he saw a smattering of does and yong bucks. feeders still
running.  e.

"Draft of Bridgeline Mini-DASH","Joe,

Take a look at the mini-dash I've thrown together.  Let me know what comments or corrections you have.  I want to get this to Stuart for his approval this evening so we can have it teed up for tomorrow morning.  The attached is just the verbage, but I think it may make sense to attach your spreadsheet and possibly some support for our Bridgeline valuation as appendices.

Thanks,
Jon

      Wednesday 01/23/02
      Raymond James Energy Daily Update

      FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY


      Energy Price Summary (Close Tuesday 01/22/02):
      Oil (WTI) - $18.98, up $0.98
      Natural Gas (HHUB) -$2.11, down $0.13
      1% Residual Oil (on a Mcf basis) - $2.72, unchanged
      London Crude Oil - $19.04, up $0.29 (so far this morning)

      1) The AGA will issue its weekly storage report at 2pm today.
*     We are expecting a withdrawal of 150-160 Bcf, which would show 7-8
Bcf/d less gas available for storage compared to last year.
*     The Street's expectations are for a 135-140 withdrawal.

      OILSERVICE

      2) Newpark (NYSE: NR) Confirms Earnings Guidance
      *     NR indicated that it expects to report earnings of
approximately $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter when it reports its
results on Feb. 26th. This pre-release is basically in-line with the
consensus estimate of $0.06 per share.
      *      NR also confirmed that it is comfortable with the consensus
estimates for fiscal 2002, which are currently around $0.30 per share.
      *      Additionally, NR announced they have received a final
commitment for the renewal of their $100 million bank credit facility
provided by a bank syndicate led by Bank One.  The facility will be
expiring
in early 2005 on terms in line with the current agreement (2% over LIBOR).
Borrowings under the credit facility were below $40 million at year-end
compared to $83 million a year earlier.
      *      NR will announce earnings after the close on February 26th
and host a conference call at 10am (EST) on February 27th.

      3) BJ Clean Up In the First Quarter
      *     BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$25.81/Strong Buy) reported fiscal
first quarter earnings of $0.42 per share (excluding goodwill
amortization),
compared with $0.38 per share last year.  This result was a penny above the
consensus estimate and $0.03 per share above our estimate.
      *     Revenues for the quarter came in at $510.1 million, down 17%
sequentially and up 4% over the prior year.  Operating margins of 20.6%
were
down roughly 4,500 basis points from the prior quarter and roughly flat
from
a year ago.
      *     A 20% sequential decline in U.S. revenues is impressive,
given the 19% decline in the U.S. rig count, combined with a 5%
deterioration in pricing.  Additionally, international revenues were down
only 12%, no thanks to the slow start to the winter season in Canada.
      *     Looking forward, the recent start-up of a new stimulation
vessel, combined with seasonally improved Canadian activity and flat to up
international activity, should help to partially offset the near-term
expected weakness in the U.S.  Likewise, continued growth in the coiled
tubing business should drive further improvements in 2002.
      *     Furthermore, BJ's share repurchase program continues to add
accretion to our estimates.  This factor, combined with the implementation
of FASB 142 (no amortization of goodwill), is now included in our
estimates.
      *     Following the quarterly report, and factoring in the
aforementioned issues, we are shaving a nickel off of our FY2002 estimate,
which goes from $1.35 to $1.30 per share.  This falls toward the low end of
the company's revised guidance range of $1.25 to $1.40 per share.
Additionally, we are raising our FY2003 EPS estimate from $1.95 to $2.00,
mainly to reflect the lack of goodwill amortization.  We are reiterating
our
Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37.00 per share (based on a
blended average of valuation techniques applied to our 2003 estimates).

      4) Trico's (NASDAQ:TMAR/$5.97/Strong Buy) Business Remains ""Afloat""
      *     In-line with nearly all levels of oilfield activity, the
supply boat business has clearly deteriorated from where it was just six
months ago.  That being said, it has not fallen apart nearly as rapidly or
to the magnitude we originally thought.
*     Industry consolidation, better balance sheets and price rationality
has buoyed supply boat dayrates in the Gulf of Mexico much better than we
have ever witnessed in the past.
*     This, combined with what appears to be a solid North Sea market is
likely to cause our earnings forecast for Trico to be overly conservative.
Furthermore, at today's price, TMAR is trading for well below asset and
book
value.
*     With an improving overall outlook for oilfield service stocks on the
horizon, TMAR appears to present a great opportunity for investors over the
long haul.

Stuart,  We can sell gas in the ordinary course of business.  I would sell as much as they will let you sell.

Gerald,
 
Joe Parks just indicated that Centana is willing to allow us to sell gas without paying them first.  Just as we first talked about with Bridgeline, they want to hold back an amount of inventory sufficient to cover the pre and post-petition demand charges.  My reaction is to sell the gas ASAP and worry about the remaining inventory later.  Please advise if this is a problem.  From my prior discussions with you, my understanding is that sales of gas by ENA are permitted without prior approval.  Let me know if that is not the case.
 
Thanks

Stuart

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Stuart

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

We cannot attend now, since our babysitter has experienced an embryonic
growth on her left stirrup (you know, that cute little bone in your
inner-ear).  Anyway, since the Knipes can't go, Corriers don't have a
baby-sitter, and there was confusion over the locale, I think we should
scrap tonight's plans.  I guess the Parks and the Wollams can still go
listen to Irish fighting music while translating non-sensicle fruit bat

Hello Everyone,

I was just informed that churns for our move to the 3rd floor are due today by 5:00 p.m.   I will have the move to locations for your group to you as soon as possible.  Please begin inputting the information for your churn ASAP and once I provide you with your new locations you can plug them in.

For coding please use your current cost center and company number.  For manager information please put my contact information.  This information is used by the move team as an alternate contact for questions regarding your churn.  I will also need to get with you on whether or not you need to move any additional equipment other than the phone line for your group.  Equipment will only be moved if the location you will be moving into does not have that particular equipment needed or if there is a business reason why the equipment must be moved.  I realize the inconvenience this may cause and apologize in advance.  

Please leet me know if you have any questions or need any assistance with your churn.

Thank you.

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about
our impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT
CHANGE, heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will
be Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they
DO have security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day
laborers drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and
lime, dining next to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good
Fun. Kind of like a good noodle house or other oriental type place...if
you see the natives eating there, you know it's good. Besides after
listening to Joe and Chet, I would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT
OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the
non-English speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon
arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

"Possible new lease member","Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"Enron Federal Credit Union Announces New Name!","Please disregard this message if you have received this in a previous mailing.

We're beaming with excitement to share our new name with you!  It's a name that reflects the true culture and beliefs of your Credit Union, and represents the reliable and innovative services you expect and enjoy as a member.
   

Due to the unfortunate circumstances that surround Enron Corp., we believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our membership and our organization.  Careful consideration went into choosing a name that we feel describes our Credit Union's trustworthiness, shining service, and extensive product line that offers value and convenience to each of our members. 

All of your Credit Union accounts remain unaffected, including your membership, loans and other account services, as does our friendly staff.  Over the next few weeks, watch your mail and our web site (currently www.enronfcu.com) for information about our new web portal and e-mail addresses, as well as communications regarding your options to receive new ATM cards, VISA check cards, credit cards and checks.  

Give us a call with any questions at 713.853.6242, or drop us a note at efcu@enron.com.  Also, watch your mail for information about our new location coming soon!  We look forward to sharing a bright future with each of you under our new name!

"Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien","Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its claim against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged from ""if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas from you"" to ""we are holding the gas till you pay us""  Based on Joe's discussions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to stored gas appears small.

Our most probable options appear to be:

 (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / colorable warehouseman's lien
       (post petition amounts are already approved);
 (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st day order;
 (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC;
 (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if available.

My preference is option (1) as :
	-	option (2) is the most unlikely, 
	-	option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we continue to accrue storage costs, and
	-	option (4) holds significant transaction risk.

Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Funding Request (""BFR"").

Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR?

Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed with (1) above?

I'm working with Joe Parks to get El Paso their money back so they might do future business with us.

Exact amount/date of payment

Was the cash paid to a DIP or non-DIP account

Rod,

Greg has requested that I forward the details of a misdirected wire that El Paso had sent to HPL in error and were unable to retrieve. Greg has attempted on several occasions to contact Lisa Mellencamp in regard to the situation without success. He indicated that if we forwarded the details to your attention you may provide some assistance.

Thanks and Regards.

Subject:	El Paso Misdirected Wire $ 154,240 to Houston Pipeline 


	I have located where El Paso in error sent a wire transfer of $ 154,240 to Houston Pipeline ( based upon my understanding a non bankrupt entity ) instead of AEP on November 26. I spoke to Bryce Baxter, Manager of Settlements as to what could be done to get El Paso their funds. He stated that as a result of the Bankruptcy, Bank of America where the wire transfer was sent, seized the account and has frozen those funds. Bryce also stated that they did not intend to return the funds since they were originally for AEP and AEP owned $ 25M on November 26 and and another $ 45M on December 26. He stated these were the instructions from Lisa Mellencamp in their Legal group. Any thoughts or direction on where to go next?

	Thanks.

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Since it appears we are going to approach Gulf South about the purchase of pad gas, shouldn't we also gauge their interest in ENA's storage/transport position, including any available molecules?

"RE: Sonat Park & Loan","Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

"FW: Letter re Unpaid Invoice for Post petition Deliveries","Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

My dear opposing counsel failed to appear at docket call this morning for 
our December 3rd, 2001 trial setting on the case you have heard me talk 
about so much.
The court dismissed their case for want of prosecution on the spot for no 
showing. While they have 30 days to try to get the case reinstated, the 
bottom line is that I will not have trial looming over my head while we hunt 
and you will not have to listen to me drone on about this ridiculous case

ChevronTexaco faces tough choices on Dynegy stake 

By Carolyn Koo 

NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - ChevronTexaco Corp. (NYSE: CVX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cvx&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/cvx.html>) faces nothing but unsavory options over its downtrodden investment in Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DNY <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dny&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dny.html>), such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away, or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader. 

	

The deep pockets of the second-largest U.S. oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy, the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes, fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall. 

But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses, or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. (Other OTC: ENRNQ.PK <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=enrnq.pk&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/enrnq.pk.html>) 

""ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place,"" said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock & Co. ""After all this, are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy?"" 

San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a ""vested interest"" in Dynegy's success, but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take. The company owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy, a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November. 

Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as $300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week, even as U.S. and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company. 

Already, Dynegy's credit rating is in danger of falling to ""junk"" levels. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Dynegy's credit rating in on review, while rival credit agency Standard & Poor's has placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch. 

""If Dynegy is downgraded to junk, they'll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco,"" said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse. 

Dynegy shares fell 57 cents, or 5.8 percent, to an almost three-year low of $9.31. ChevronTexaco's stock has not been rocked by the power trading sector's woes. Its shares rose $2.15, or 2.4 percent, to $90.10. 

BOARD'S ROLE 

Dynegy is also the subject of several probes, including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal, ""Project Alpha,"" that cut the company's tax bill by $80 million. Another probe is looking into ""wash trades"" intended solely to boost trading volumes. 

ChevronTexaco's silence since Dynegy's troubles have come to light has worried analysts. 

When credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week, it said it was ""concerned about the lack of any public statement of support"" from ChevronTexaco ""in this period of market tumult"" for Dynegy. 

""If the situation deteriorates, I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy,"" said James Elliot, a portfolio manager with Dominick & Dominick Advisors. 

Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation. Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegy's board, including Chief Financial Officer John Watson. 

""It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing,"" said Gheit. ""I hope not, because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco."" 

He added that bailing out Dynegy ""would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy. The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco ."" 

Chevron acquired the stake in 1996, before its merger with Texaco, when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp. bought Chevron's natural gas business. 

ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming $1.5 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company. It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegy's planned purchase of Enron.

"RE:","I need to call the place today.  You go ahead and make plans - some Tony's
margaritas will do you some good.  I can take them to their first session if
need be. It's only 30 minutes.  Their instructor is a college student named
Frank - he has been training down there for the last four months, but this
is his first session to teach.  I guess I am a little apprehensive about
that - but then I think, I was teaching kids by myself at age 13.  Funny,
how it's different when you think about entrusting your kids with someone
else.  What are your thoughts?

    Deer All:

    I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot
or to

    fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm
response).

    B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a
head
    of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
    were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out
and
    doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
    Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a
spot.
    His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor.
Looking
    for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
    there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
    would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

    He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but
I
    don't care about that.

    Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
    proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds
up
    taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with
two

    spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer
this

    spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can
be
    the fall back plan.

"Centana Transaction","Gerald/Chip,

Could you tell me how to proceed on this deal.  This differs a bit from the deal that was originally discussed but seems to make sense.  Please disregard the second attachment at it relates to a modification of the Storage Agreement that has not been discussed (and one that we are not willing to make).  Also, the letter as drafted does not contemplate (but we will insist on) placement of the proceeds from the sale of gas associated with pre-petition amounts into escrow with some third party until some resolution is reached on those amounts.

By way of example, if Centana is owed $100k pre-petition, $150k post-petition and has $1,000,000 worth of gas in the ground, Centana would remit (i) $100k to an escrow agent for subsequent resolution and disposition and (ii) $750k to ENA ($900k offset by the $150k for post petition obligations).

The key issue is what level of approval is needed to do this.  A strong case could be made for Cash Committee only because no pre-petition amounts are being paid (and no resolution of those amounts is being reached).  Rather, we are just converting the commodity to cash when the market is higher than it has been over the past several weeks.

Another good reason for doing this is that after the cavern is empty, we can argue that we are not using it and therefore no more post-petition obligations continue to accrue following the consummation of the deal (while we decide to accept or reject).

Please advise at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

"Prepay for Tennessee and TXU","Maragaret,
I have 2 prepays in this email.  We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.

Note to all
The first prepay is to TXU.  I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.

The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.  If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.

My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.  So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.  We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about our
impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT CHANGE,
heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will be
Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO have
security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers
drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining next
to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of like a
good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the natives
eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and Chet, I
would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the non-English
speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42. Send to 815 walker, 
suite 1447, H/T 77002. Thank you.

Erik.

"Re: Ought 2","Food: I have a deer sausage lagsana frozen and ready to go. That takes care 
of dinner one night. If we want steaks for second night, I'm ok with that. 
Chad, its your turn to go to the groc. We have yet to even up for the season 
as far as I know B still needs to get even on Keg 1 and 2 and whatever food 
from last trip. I've got about 70 into the thanksgiving food trip.

I think there is plenty of keg beer left, but, i have some canned bud light 
i can bring just in case. no need to buy more. I don't know the scotch 
status, but i think there is plenty left. I can bring a back up bottle from 
the house.

Chad if you are doing the shopping, plan on breakfast/lunch for 2 mornings 
(your stuff and a breakfast roll), small amount of sandwich meat and bread, 
sides for dinners (if wanted...salad)chips and velveta ( there is plenty of 
salsa I believe).

We do not need to worry about ice, couple of bags should do. temps will 
allow hanging of game.

really would prefer am depart tomarrow. e.

"Media Coverage of Enron","While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air.  

Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.


MONEY
New Enron CEO turns company focus to future ; While workers cope with loss and uncertainty
Noelle Knox

02/18/2002
USA Today
FINAL
B.03
(Copyright 2002)

HOUSTON -- Inside Enron headquarters, employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Post-it Notes from the empty desks of their laid-off co-workers. On one desk, an employee finds a note that reads: ""I'm not gone, don't take my stuff!"" 
Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns, Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost 18,000 employees who work on Enron's power plants and pipelines.
USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper, the new chief executive, talking about his vision for the future. 
On the 50th floor of executive suites, decorated with rich carpets and velvet-covered chairs, there is a sweeping view of Houston -- a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy, political donations and corporate muscle. Cooper, however, is only focused on saving part of the company. 
His plan faces monumental challenges. In his words, ""Everybody's betting against us."" 
While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the past year -- Kmart, Polaroid, Bethlehem Steel -- the size, speed and sordid details of Enron's collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits, angered creditors, demoralized employees and ruined its reputation. 
But Cooper -- whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid, Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores - - is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year. 
""I've probably been in more Chapter 11s than anybody in the United States, literally,"" he says. ""This company, by way of business and asset base, by way of management team, by way of predictability of its future business, has more of all of that than most distressed businesses I've ever seen."" 
Cooper's plans 
The company already has sold the energy-trading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg. Although a bankruptcy court and Enron's creditors must first approve any moves, Cooper's plans include: 
* Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a ""more modest habitat,"" Cooper says. 
* The company's new $100 million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale. 
* Even Enron's name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go. 
""Out of the ashes, there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year, or two, or three from now,"" he says. 
Today, the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida. And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel. 
He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the company's businesses, including its broadband network, water utilities and the like. 
That will mean cutting an additional 10% to 20% off Enron's payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the 1980s. 
But to pull off his plan, Cooper must not only sway his critics, including giant Wall Street creditors, but also motivate thousands of devastated employees. 
""Cooper and (Enron President Jeff) McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated,"" says John Whitney, a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University. 
To lock in 500 key executives, Enron offered $55 million in retention bonuses. Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energy-trading business also pocketed multimillion-dollar payoffs. 
And Cooper's pay? 
The New York-based consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive $1.3 million a year, plus $1.2 million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston. If Enron emerges from bankruptcy, Cooper's firm will get a $5 million fee. If Enron is liquidated, Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
Shattered morale 
Enron's fall from grace has shattered employee morale. 
""It's just so sad,"" says one current employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""On several floors, it looks like the rapture. It looks like people disappeared into space. They're just gone."" 
This employee, just two years away from retirement, watched $160,000 in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enron's stock price. ""Now I'm going to have to work as a greeter at Wal-Mart until I'm 90,"" the employee says. ""It's gone. I just can't make it back."" 
Jorge Garcia, a project controls manager laid off in December, says his friends still at Enron say, "" 'You can tell if you'll be let go soon by your office accommodations. If you've been moved to a cubicle, you probably won't last long.' "" 
That kind of stress takes its toll. 
Downstairs in the company gym, Kathy Kissner, a massage therapist, says that as the company fell apart, employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments. 
""I've lost 30 pounds in the last six months"" from long hours and lack of sleep, says Mark Palmer, vice president of communications. 
Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally. It's the hardest part of his job. 
""When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money, they often times get heated. They get emotional and upset,"" he says. ""It's never fun to be at the receiving end, but I've gotten used to it."" 
Blast voice mail 
To motivate the employees, he is trying to focus them on future goals. ""People have two choices: We can spend all of our time living in the past, which is a crazy way to spend your life. You can't change it. Or, we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss, to focus on the future,"" he says. 
And he has opened up lines of communication. 
Once a week, he sends out a lengthy voice mail, telling employees what has happened during the past week, explaining management changes and timetables. 
When employees call or send him e-mail, he will go find them in the building to answer their questions. And next month, he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy. 
This kind of candid communication is essential, he says. 
""We are not trying to eliminate bad news. We are not trying to make it just good news. What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty,"" he says. ""People can live with either one of those, good or bad. What they can't live with is uncertainty."" 
And while some still say Enron's future is uncertain, Cooper is certain of one thing: 
""The lives and reputations of 20,000 people shouldn't be trash- canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild,"" he says. ""People ought to keep in perspective that we've got a lot of really tremendous people here, and for the sake of a couple bad apples, we shouldn't blowtorch the entire field.""

The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation: Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted, Stephen Cooper says.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down, according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper, the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency. 
Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid, although he declined to identify specific targets.
""Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate,"" said Cooper, a principal with Zolfo Cooper, a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. ""I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later."" 
The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play, and all are potential defendants. 
Enron filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees. The nation's seventh-largest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the off-the-books partnerships, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than 6,000 jobs. 
An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1 billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor, and Vinson & Elkins, one of its outside law firms. 
Still Sorting Out All the Issues 
Cooper, who occupies Skilling's old office on the 50th floor of Enron's mirrored office tower in downtown Houston, said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions. That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F. Glisan. 
""I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation,"" Cooper said. 
Cooper and his team are still ""sorting out issues"" related to Enron's financial statements and the value of its trading book, the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation. Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection, the value of those contracts has eroded to about $1 billion from about $7 billion. 
""I certainly don't believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that aren't completely above board,"" Cooper said. ""We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements, which I believe, in the main, will be accurate."" Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen, which it fired. 
Enron already has filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. alleging that its cross-town rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company. Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investment-grade credit rating. 
The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the market-dominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built. The name will change, and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plants--the kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained. 
Cooper's style, too, is unlike Lay's grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skilling's hard-driving image. Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office, complete with baseball cap. He hasn't decorated Skilling's wood-paneled, deadbolted office. 
To keep up employee morale, Cooper said he visits workers in response to e-mail and sends out weekly, unscripted voicemail updates. An all-employee meeting will be held soon, he said. 
Enron's overhaul is well underway. 
Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline, 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas, which was a condition of the $1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger. Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energy-trading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit. 
What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines, including one that runs from Texas to California, and electricity generating plants. Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General, its Oregon utility, as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company. 
Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because ""we haven't settled on a final configuration yet. But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron. 
""The company, if you remove the trading from the rest of the business, it's actually got a very good, very solid, very revenue- and cash-flow- and earnings-predictable business, which is really its power and pipes business,"" Cooper said. ""So in my view, there is an eminently reorganizable entity here."" 
'Not Going to Wallow and Linger' 
Cooper expects to present ""a fairly on-point direction"" for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year. 
""We're going to move this process forward very quickly. We're not going to wallow and linger in Chapter 11 for a day longer than we have to."" 
Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold, Cooper said he is ""not of that mind,"" adding that in his 30-year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business. Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate, he said. 
Enron has a bit of that. Although it leases its Houston headquarters, Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door. It has received $40 million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project. 
Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a post-mortem on Enron, but he did acknowledge the ""very labor-intensive"" process of sorting through ""hundreds upon hundreds"" of so-called special purpose entities, which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the company's balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes, such as a sale and lease-back of a building. 
Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enron's liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle, he said. A team of about 10 Zolfo Cooper employees, an unusually large number, is being assigned to Enron, Cooper said. 
""There's a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not. Both of these are being looked at. We'll just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out,"" Cooper said. 
Special purpose entities ""are not good or bad, they're just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business, to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business,"" Cooper said. 
""The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk [from Enron to the partnerships] and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties"" by working for both Enron and the partnerships, he said. 
""What we saw here was a case where they weren't constructed properly, they weren't reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction, you couldn't have really an arm's-length transaction. It's kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement."" 
Despite its size, the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled, Cooper said. Those included Federated Department Stores Inc., Polaroid Corp. and Malden Mills. 
Unique to Enron, however, is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business, Cooper said. 
""It's become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company, but it's become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests"" involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance, Cooper said. 
""I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies, a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees,"" Cooper said. 
""It's sort of like when your car breaks down and you're in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car. You're kicking the tires. You're kicking the bumpers. After you get over it, you realize that it's still a good car. You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going.""

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

"Houston Texans Football - Seat licenses and tickets","Enron has made initial payments toward the purchase of Personal Seat Licenses (PSLs) for Houston Texans Football, and has the right to purchase the associated season tickets.  Enron is no longer interested in these season tickets and is working to secure the best economic result for the estate.  This may involve stopping any further payments, however if there is significant interest among employees in buying the season tickets from Enron, the company may pursue a resale arrangement as one means of recovering the investment it has already made.

If you're interested in purchasing any of Enron's PSLs and season tickets for the Texans, please respond by 4PM, Central Time on Wednesday, June 12 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you would be interested in purchasing and the price category.  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined from the employee group, Enron will determine how to proceed in order to benefit the estate.   As listed below, the face value of the PSLs range from $1,900 to $3,900 each, and the face value of the season tickets range from $645 to $2575 each.   It is currently envisioned that if any sale of the interests by Enron does occur, it would be open to the public as well as employees.

Please note that your response will not obligate either you or Enron in any way.  Responses will be considered an expression of interest only, and do not guarantee if, when, or at what price respondents may be able to purchase these assets. 

If you have any questions, please call Elizabeth Linnell at x33896.


Location 	Price per PSL		Price per Season Ticket  	Total Price per seat
A		$3,900			$745				$4,645

From:  Office of the Chief Executive
Date:  February 21, 2002
Re:  Management Changes

As a company working to emerge from bankruptcy, Enron looks and feels completely different.  However, one thing is the same - we continue to move and change at a fast pace.  Last week, we shared with you a developing management team.  This week, we want to update you on some further management changes that have taken shape.

Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel, will retire from Enron effective March 1, 2002.

Rob Walls, currently deputy general counsel, will succeed Derrick and serve immediately as acting general counsel.

We are also happy to announce that Mike McConnell, formerly CEO of Enron Global Markets, is returning to the company to help identify and develop business opportunities within our remaining non-regulated businesses.

We will continue to share changes to the management team as they occur.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Zero graduation rate is the real cause for outrage 
Posted: Monday March 04, 2002 11:29 AM 
          
    

Sports Illustrated senior writer Phil Taylor touches on a Hot Button issue each Monday on CNNSI.com. After you read Phil's take, give us yours. 

We saw the two faces of Arkansas basketball coach Nolan Richardson last week. One was the enraged look of a man who felt he had been wronged. The other was the calm visage of a man denying that he had wronged others. Apparently, injustice only angers Richardson, who was bought out of his contract last week, when he sees himself as the victim of it, not when he's the perpetrator of it. 

By now you've probably seen the footage of Richardson's rambling tirade during a press conference in which he, among other things, complained that the media is prejudiced against him because he's African-American, and declared that he was the best thing the university had going for it. ""You can run that on every TV station in the country,"" he said when he was finished. Richardson was paranoid and pompous at the same time, a despot unraveling before our very eyes. The validity of his claim -- that he's judged more harshly than white coaches -- is open to debate, although anyone who is his school's highest-paid coach at more than $1 million per year, has a free country club membership and the use of an SUV at no charge, as Richardson did, hardly needs the NAACP to come to his aid. 

But a fact that's not in dispute is that none of the African-American athletes who entered Richardson's program from 1990 to '94 has graduated. Not a single one. That staggering truth was brought to light by last week's installment of ESPN's Outside the Lines. According to the program, Arkansas was one of 36 Division I schools with a zero percent graduation rate for African-American players during that span (which is an educational disgrace, but that's a topic for another time), but none of the other 35 had an African-American coach who was casting himself as the victim of racism at the same time. 

It was striking to see how calmly Richardson defended himself against that damning statistic on OTL, compared to the fury with which he railed against the supposed racists who have had the nerve to criticize his coaching and recruiting. His voice was even and measured as he explained that one of the main reasons his players left without diplomas is that so many of them come to school for the sole purpose of (gasp!) improving their basketball skills. Richardson made it sound as if he were the victim yet again, that kids were using his basketball program for their own selfish purposes when he thought they were just as interested in chemistry lab. 

This is hypocrisy at its most blatant. Even if everything Richardson accuses the white media of is true, nothing they have done to him has been as damaging as what his program has done to the young African-American men who have come through it. Don't tell me that he's just a basketball coach, that he can't walk every one of his kids to every one of their classes. Coaches make sure every rep their players do in the weight room is documented. They know when their backup power forward's body fat rises or falls a percentage point. They can pay just as close attention to their players' academic progress, and they can recruit only those players they think have a fighting chance to get a diploma. The coaches who really care do exactly that. 

If African-American athletes and their families can't depend on coaches of the same skin color to think about the kids as students as well as players, who can they depend on? You would think that with Richardson's obvious mistrust of many whites, he wouldn't have to be asked that question. 

I don't want to hear Nolan Richardson complain about some white columnist who says he doesn't recruit as well as he used to. I want to hear him stand up and say that whatever slights he may or may not have received during his tenure at Arkansas don't amount to a hill of beans; that his program's graduation rate for African-American players is obscene, and that as the man, as the black man, who was in charge of that program, he is ashamed of it and embarrassed by it. If he ever brings himself to utter those words, you can run that on every TV station in the country. 

Sports Illustrated senior writer Phil Taylor writes about a Hot Button issue every Monday on CNNSI.com.

"RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails","It probably makes sense to circle up on this on Monday and also to discuss a call that I received from Randy.  He indicated that we should probably sit down with Bridgeline to discuss the likelihood of acceptance/rejection of the storage/transport deal in order to potentially figure out what is most beneficial for both parties.

Subject:	RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.

Subject:	Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. 

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. 

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. 

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

Subject:	Wholesale Business Plan

Just to give all some background.

We would like to understand the business plan for ENA, so that we can plan staffing, etc.  For example, in Retail, the business plan is to sale the books of business by May 31.  That allows us to make plans for each functional area to determine staffing gaps, etc.

We are looking for the same on Wholesale.

Chris - Can you help us with that?  If not, we will need to reschedule the meeting.

Let me know.

Subject: New Lease Update


Talked to Mertz last night. Take this for whatever it is worth...
Bottom line is that he says the lease I sent him, 16,000 per year for
2002
to 2005 looks good, it is the money he wants, we take good care of his
place, shoot mature bucks and we will get the lease, BUT he won't sign
the
lease until next fall, ""because I don't have to"". Whatever.
I said we just wanted to know for certain that we had a place to hunt
for
the next four years and wanted to make sure we did not need to start
looking
for another lease. He said we had the place and not to worry about it,
he
just wanted to see how the new protien program panned out before signing

off. Once again, whatever. He also says he's pouring the stuff out heavy

right now.
He gave me his word and seemed upbeat about everything. I'm going to
leave
it at that until next fall. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. His

great deal on the Zander's old lease fell apart on him (he was suppossed
to
have out of state hunters show up for two weeks and they were going to
pay
him 30k a year). Maybe the concept of some good lessees who pay on time
and
take care of his land will look more realistic and attractive.
He, as usual, stressed his never ending desire to grow a big deer. He's
counting on this new super food to do it this year. I guess the best we
can
do to assure a lease renewal is to hunt hard and kill him some big deer.

Site in your guns and bring plenty of ammo next fall.
Erik.

It doesn't matter to me.  I was just thinking that if we could lump the payment and wire request with the Exxon request it might save us the trouble of preparing two requests. But you also have a good point about being in the middle.   What would El Paso rather us do?

This should go for insturctions on the El Paso check too.  It could go directly to AEP as well.  Troy is preparing a payment request and Lisa Koerselma should be in charge of doing the wire transfer request.

I have received a similar question and would love to get an answer on this.  Is there a distinction between a loan and a payment received by mistake for purposes of repayment from a debtor company?

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP have called asking for their money.  Please advise.

Gerald, Joe and I meet today at 3:30pm regarding MCV.  It was decided that we still need to continue to cure the contract.  According to our accounting group they have been paid for December and November.  I spoke with Lee Smith today at 3:50pm.  He said MCV will have nominations in place to accept supply for the month of February.  We are looking to buy gas from the following counterparties.  MidAmerican, Nicor Enerchange L.L.C., and Sequent.

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about our
impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT CHANGE,
heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will be
Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO have
security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers
drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining next
to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of like a
good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the natives
eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and Chet, I
would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the non-English
speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

								PIGGY

Not sure what the 20 ""MAN NIGHT"" emails are in my inbox from yesterday, but

Dreyfus said they are interested in you but not for the lead role for this
situation. Since you have something that is close, you might not be
available when Dreyfus is ready.
Please keep me posted on your situation and thanks for your interest in my

Randy,

Sounds interesting, I wonder if they have been in contact with Enron, or
anyone here. I would be interested, but within a week or so I may be
elsewhere, so let me know. If they can move quicky,I am not interested in
moving to Conn but have an interest in Houston.

Let me know, the type of person they are looking for fits well timing isnt
great but sounds like they have a bigger plan.


You can email me here or home.

Greg,

Here is the basic information on Dreyfus. Tim Stuart is the President of
Louis Dreyfus Energy Services, which is primarily the liquids trading
business at present. (go to: http://www.louisdreyfus.com/, click ""energy"",
and ""petrochemicals"".
Here is the generic recruiting email I sent out:

I request your assistance in gathering names of candidates for an ENERGY
EXECUTIVE search.

My Client: An $18 billion GLOBAL COMMODITY TRADING organization.

The Opportunity: Through acquisitions and joint ventures, to BUILD AN ASSET
BASED ENERGY TRADING COMPANY with the objective of monetizing the
optionality around those assets.

The Candidate: A STRATEGIC VISIONARY, capable of building a value oriented
organization, and capitalizing upon financial and physical trade arbitrage
opportunities.

Bottom line is they want back in to the physical business and they are
looking for the lead person to do it. The preference is to base them in
Wilton, CT but they will also consider Houston.
Besides experience trading a ""physical gas book"", this person must have
strong entrepeurnial and strategic instincts. Which assets should they buy?
Why? Which joint venture relationships make sense and why? These issues
require someone with a big picture understanding and vision of the energy
industry and an understanding of how to evaluate and monetize the
optionality of assets.
Some people may be great traders, but they don't have the aggressiveness and
vision to direct the business side of this venture. Some people may have
strong ""asset"" background but they don't understand how to manage a trade
group to squeeze the most value from assets through sophisticated and
creative trading strategies. This position requires both.
I would like to put your resume in front of them. Your recent experience
trading around the Bridgeline system would be of interest.
Please let me know what you think?

Randy

"Enron Reinstates Savings Plan Match","We have good news for participants of the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  Last Friday, the creditors' committee and our board of directors approved our proposal to reinstate the company match.  We can enact the match in the normal course of business without bankruptcy court approval.

Beginning July 1, 2002, Enron will again match employee pre-tax contributions to the Plan.  The match will be credited to active participants' eligible contributions on their first paycheck in July.

In addition, from July 1 through December 31, 2002, Enron will double the rate of the company match that was in effect prior to the suspension, with a maximum match on employee pretax contributions of 6 percent of base salary.  In January 2003, the rate of the company match will return to the level in effect prior to the suspension.

Beyond reinstating the match, Enron is also instituting the following enhancements to the Savings Plan:
?	The company match will follow participants' investment elections.  In other words, the company match will be allocated to the same funds in which the participant has elected to invest.
?	Currently, participants are able to contribute one to 15 percent of their base salaries to the Savings Plan.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution up to a maximum of 50 percent of their base salary.  The 2002 federal limit for pre-tax contributions to the Savings Plan is $11,000.
?	Participants who are age 50 or older in 2002 will be able to contribute up to $12,000 of pre-tax income to the Savings Plan in 2002.  This additional $1,000 is not eligible for company-matched contributions.

Active Enron employees who are not currently participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan have until 3:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, June 27, 2002 to enroll in the Plan for their first July payroll contribution to be matched.  The same deadline applies to active participants in the Plan who may wish to increase their Savings Plan contribution rate in time for the first July payroll.  (For now, participants can only increase their contribution rate to the current maximum of 15 percent of base salary.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution rate to the new maximum of 50 percent.)

To enroll in the Savings Plan or make a change to your current contributions, please log on to <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>, or call the Benefit Service Center at 1-800-332-7979, option 3.

pooled wholesale and retail resources
figure out how to get the people together

we've completly revamped the sr management team

$3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth.
stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.

2.

all the difficult times are behind us
he understands our urge to leave
take a deep breath, think about how what you do will enhance career.

creditor's committee has approved the retention plan

plan brings substantial amount of money to bear 
jobs may change
email will go out next week detailing plan
management will talk to people before next friday about how the overall retention plan will impact us and our coworkers


Liquidation bucket - people settleing terminated positions, assets, primarily commercial oriented.  Commision type environment.
Retention Pool - cetain amount of money is paid on a qtrly basis.
Severeance plan - safety net for people not in retention or liguidation bucket.
anyone in severance plan will have their monies offset by any monies they recieve  on one of the other plans.

3.
personal message 
be positive
have some fun
get a bounce back in your walk
you can be part of fixing it
take next year or 2 years to learn and develope.

queston:  what is the goal of the company

we are not going to try and develope new business.

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.

Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month

Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

Subject: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT


Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander, 
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

"RE: Gas Brokers/Contacts","Thanks for the contacts.  

Just to let you know we're already working with Greg Kaufman from Fame (a collaboration of Amerex and Prebon).  They're pulling together sample data for us to preview.  

Amerex - the day end quotes are limited in tenor (usually only out to Oct. 2002) & Joe Parks already has copies of most of these reports.
Prebon - same tenor problem as Amerex.  Don't know the status of the copies in-house.
APB - Truequote - I'm already working with Trevor Atkins - We should get their data for free in the next couple of days

Supposedly the Fame, transactional data is better than the Amerex and Prebon end of day quotes.  The issue here will likely be data format more than content.  I'll let you know once we hear back.

"Power Outage at Enron Building","
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Either way, it sounds like we're dealing w/ the Axis of Evil Restaurant chain.

"","Ed,

Here are the updates for the following contracts:

MCV contracts have been cured for the month of February 2002.  Supply was purchased from MidAmerican Energy.  A prepayment of  $1,158,864.00 was wire to MidAmerican on January 30, 2002.  

		Locations	Price	Volumes	   Total $
		PEPL-field	$2.02	5,000/d		$  282,800		
		ANR-SE	$2.05	4,000/d		$   229,600
		Trunkline-ELA	$2.08	11,100		$   646,464	
							$1,158,864

January 31, 2002 Gas Daily publications posted Nymex settlement for March 2002 at $2.08.  Daily cash posting were as follow for gas flow January 31st. PEPL-OK at $2.02, ANR-SE at $2.03, Trunkline-ELA at $2.06


Based on our meeting with Kinder Morgan regarding NGPL-NSS storage contract# 114786 and #114846.  They are expecting demand payment for the month of December (They are allowing January charges to be paid at a later date) from ENA before allowing us to do a permanent release and/or an in-field transfers.  Ruth C. is in the process of filing out a cash request and wire transfer form.  She will then submit it for approval and to the cash management committee.  This process normally takes 5 days.  We are recommending that the process is expedited so that we can get the storage service and inventory sold.    If we pay today, we could potential sell these assets as soon as Friday.


I will be out on Monday.  If this deal does not close Friday, I will give Joe Parks the necessary information to close the deal on Monday.

"RE: PNL","Joe,

Last night was the first night that any of your gas daily (you began a position on the 14th or 15th)  pl pulled through. It was an error on our side. So the value that came through last night is a net value of all your gas daily trades to date.

The major difference seems to be in gas daily, about $16k. Will you look at it please.

"lease report","Deer All,
attached is the 2001 game log (to date) keith is heading out during the 
doe/spike season. i'll need him to update me when he returns so i can get 
the info to mertz.

Looks like we had a solid year. Congrats to Joe on his 9, Keith on his drop 
thing, Brian on acutually shooting not one, but two deer. Both were solid 
bucks. Congrats to Chris on going at all which was in question after 
incident last spring and pregnant wife. Thanks to the McComb boys for their 
incredible addition to the trailer...the kegarator. It inspired us all 
season long (and it is empty again).

Rent goes up this year and it is due a month earlier now, March and August. 
It will be $2k a gun for 8 members. Chet will probably not be taking this 
spot. I would like to know if the McCombs would like to fill that spot for 
use by J.T. and/or Anne Marie and/or Tyler in some form or fashion that 
works for all. Let's talk. I would like to avoid adding someone ""new"" to the 
lease that would have their own group/family they would want to take as 
guests.

Mertz stopped by on sunday. very friedly, thanked us for our business and 
and hauled our trash off the lease for us....I'm not kidding. Guess he is 
really looking forward to the rent increase.

Late season Doe and Spike slayers:

There are 7.5 bags of corn left in the barn. Feeder status is as follows:
Hole empty and i have unhooked the battery.
booger working half full, protien
Lonestar working and half full
3030 empty and motor returned to trailer
mesquite flat empty, but protien in feeder, i disconnected the corn battery.
gray box near bottom of barrel, but still feeding. we did not hunt their
showtime working and half full, protien
hideout: did not check, probably empty.
pig stand working 1/3 full, protien , not hunted
boneyard working (slow and weak spin) half full.

There is a spike(s) in the mesquite flat. may want to corn the road and see 
if he shows, if not, good place to take a doe.

Boneyard/Pig stand had a spike with bladed type antlers earlier in the year 
and we could stand to take another doe from that pasture

Lonestar could give up a doe

booger has a few does around it. i saw six. there are two prime zoo 
canditates there. the first is an old bag that has carmel coolered hide on 
her stomache/mid section. her shoulders and butt are normal tan. the other 
is an old doe with unique white/gray patches of hair on her back near the 
tail. Looks like fur missing until you look closer.
WARNING:
BEER ALL GONE.

Next spring we can set up a work weekend to move the pig stand blind to the 
boneyard location and build a new big box to set up near the windmill in the 
half section. I also vote to remove 3030. It was not hunted much, and I 
think is splits the deer up between booger/hole and lonestar. I vote to use 
the tripod to set up at hot spots and move the feeder to double up at 
lonestar.

Cc: Schneider, Chip
Subject: Centana Transaction


Gerald/Chip,

Could you tell me how to proceed on this deal.  This differs a bit from the deal that was originally discussed but seems to make sense.  Please disregard the second attachment at it relates to a modification of the Storage Agreement that has not been discussed (and one that we are not willing to make).  Also, the letter as drafted does not contemplate (but we will insist on) placement of the proceeds from the sale of gas associated with pre-petition amounts into escrow with some third party until some resolution is reached on those amounts.

By way of example, if Centana is owed $100k pre-petition, $150k post-petition and has $1,000,000 worth of gas in the ground, Centana would remit (i) $100k to an escrow agent for subsequent resolution and disposition and (ii) $750k to ENA ($900k offset by the $150k for post petition obligations).

The key issue is what level of approval is needed to do this.  A strong case could be made for Cash Committee only because no pre-petition amounts are being paid (and no resolution of those amounts is being reached).  Rather, we are just converting the commodity to cash when the market is higher than it has been over the past several weeks.

Another good reason for doing this is that after the cavern is empty, we can argue that we are not using it and therefore no more post-petition obligations continue to accrue following the consummation of the deal (while we decide to accept or reject).

Please advise at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

Lets plan ahead on the Al K. Hall issue, remember I'm drinking for two now..(Pig and I).
 
Food Issue:  Just because Piggy ain't cookin' doesn't mean we have to eat like alternate/persons.  I say we do it right at least on Sat night.(i.e.ribeyes.......)
Sat. a.m.: I made a Mex. egg/cheese/& stuff casserole for x-mas morning that was pretty damn good---I can pre-make it and all we have to do is heat & eat.

I agree, we started out with 3, went to 1, no we are going in the wrong direction again.  By the way, wasn't Mertz supposed to add more acreage to this ranch?  I think we have hunted everything we can on ol' Autry.

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be

sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

"PIRA Launches European Electricity Service","Dear PIRA Retainer Client:

European electricity markets are experiencing an unprecedented surge in trading volumes and will be entering new phases of integration and liberalization in the years to come. As barriers to trade rapidly erode among countries, and regional markets emerge, we are witnessing all forms of change in pricing basis, and new areas of power trade are constantly evolving.

With these changes in mind, PIRA Energy Group announces the launching of its new European Electricity Service (EES) <http://www.pira.com/ClientServices/EES.htm>, an Internet-based Retainer Service that complements PIRA's existing market coverage of European and North American natural gas, North American power, and global oil.

EES provides clients with a robust data base, including detailed information for over 4,000 power plants, as well as market insights into the developments of power generation, demand, cross-border trading, and prices. PIRA's reputation for grasping market fundamentals is unrivaled, and EES continues in that tradition by helping clients to analyze how to capture value in the rapidly changing European electricity market.

Clients of EES will benefit from:

1. Analysis of major and subtle shifts in market trends, which will impact supply availability, power demand, cross-border trading, and price direction;

2. Opportunities to dig deeply into the rich EES database and reveal key issues influencing both short- and long-term market fundamentals;

3. Integration of PIRA's unparalleled reputation for gas and oil forecasting in addressing interfuel competition and arbitrage opportunities in the European market.

The attached prospectus provides more information about EES or you can go to our website at http://www.pira.com/ClientServices/EES.htm. Please take some time to review the material and contact me to discuss the service or to sign up for an online trial of EES.

PLEASE NOTE: Current PIRA European Natural Gas (ENG) Clients can realize significant discounts when adding EES to their existing ENG Retainer Service.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

A.J. Conley

raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk

"FW: Greenspan Article","

      LOS ANGELES--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once again found
 himself in legal trouble Monday, when he and several members of his
extensive entourage were arrested for allegedly destroying a penthouse
suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

      Hotel officials say Greenspan, in town to address an annual
convention of Federal Reserve District Bank presidents, caused an estimated
 $8,500 in damages to the room, the surrounding hallway and the
swimming-pool area.

      Said Beverly Hills Hotel manager Giles Laurent: ""The television
screen and cabinet had apparently been kicked in. Two chairs were thrown
out the window. The mattress was ripped and its stuffing was flung all over
 the room, as well as into the hallway."" Laurent added that minutes before
police arrived, Greenspan, with the help of Deputy Treasury Secretary
Kenneth 
Dam, pushed a vending machine off the balcony overlooking the hotel's
swimming 
pool.

      During his two-day stay at the posh hotel, Greenspan also accumulated
a $781.55 room-service bill, which he has refused to pay until June 1,
when he says interest rates on German 10-year Euro-Bunds will rise to a
more favorable 5.5 percent.

      Witnesses to Greenspan's behavior during the days leading up to
Monday's arrest said the 75-year-old head of the Federal Open Market
Committee was in an unusually volatile mood.

      ""Upon arriving Friday, Mr. Greenspan demanded that four large bowls
of M&Ms be delivered to his room, with all the orange ones removed,""
Beverly Hills Hotel concierge Alexander Poole said. ""Then, when he got to
his room and saw the bowls, he flew into a rage, knocking over lamps and
screaming that he wanted the green M&Ms taken out, not the orange ones.""

      Greenspan got into more trouble Saturday night, when he, Fed
Vice-Chair William J. McDonough and several other members of his inner
circle
visited a trendy L.A. night spot. Clubgoers reported seeing Greenspan, still
high 
off the dollar's rally against the yen last week, shout obscenities and
throw ashtrays 
at the club's DJ. When security personnel attempted to restrain him,
Greenspan became
belligerent, yelling, ""I'm Alan F***ing Greenspan,"" and vowing to put
bouncer Frank Rizzo in a ""hurt bracket."" The incident is already being
compared to his infamous July 1997 fistfight with John Kenneth Galbraith at
 New York's China Club.

<<Greenspan_drunk015.jpg>>

Above: The famous Beverly Hills Hotel, site of the Fed chief's latest brush
 with the law.

      According to Federal Reserve Board insiders, Greenspan, buoyed by the
U.S. economy's recent turn-around has grown increasingly megalomaniacal 
in recent months.

      ""He'll spend hours talking about how he's the greatest economist who
ever lived, how he's 'bigger than Keynes,'"" said one member of the Fed
Board of Governors who wished to remain anonymous. ""Every time he talks 
about single-handedly saving America from potential economic ruin following 
the Sept. 11th tragedy by manipulating interest rates, his bloated ego just
swells 
even more. It's just the sort of irrational exuberance he himself once
warned against.""

      Monday's arrest is only the latest in a long string of legal troubles
for the controversial Greenspan, who has had 22 court dates since becoming
Fed chief in 1987. Economists recall his drunken 1994 appearance on CNN's
Moneyline, during which he unleashed a profanity-laden tirade against
Bureau of Engraving & Printing director Larry Rolufs and punched host Lou
Dobbs when he challenged Greenspan's reluctance to lower interest rates. In
 November 1993, he was arrested after running shirtless through D.C.
traffic while waving a gun. And some world-market watchers believe the
international gold standard has still not recovered from a May 1998
incident in which he allegedly exposed his genitals on the floor of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.

      Greenspan's latest quandary now involves women and minorities.  When
asked
about U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's speech at the Women
Entrepreneurs
Conference on March 19th, Greenspan was overheard saying ""What a waste of
Paul's
time.  Women and business don't go together.  Just look at what Elaine
[Chao, U.S. 
Secretary of Labor] has done for our labor markets.  She's just making my
life hell.  
She's the perfect example of why affirmative action doesn't work.""

How much longer can Greenspan last in his position?  Only time will tell.
But, he's 
looking more and more like a ticking time bomb.

"RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails","I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.

Subject:	Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. 

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. 

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. 

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

"RE:  Gas flow and prepayment schedule through 3/28/02","Today, I revised the $70,000.00 wire to $989,700.00.

This money gets applied to the following April deals on Florida;
			April 1st	10,000 dth x 1 day x $3.27 = 	$32,700.00
			April 2nd-30th	10,000 dth x 29 days x $3.30 = 	$957,000.00
					Total Prepayment		$989,700.00

I'm not sure if anyone is using the attached worksheet but I've included the baseload wire and purchase information on the summary tab.

Subject:	 Gas flow and prepayment schedule through 3/28/02


I have requested the following payments to made to Reliant on Thur, 3/28/02.

 Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00
This item is NOT included on my worksheet.  I did this deal with Jim Taylor yesterday.

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline $40,000.00 (normal weekly prepay).
Prepay to Reliant for possible intraday supply on Florida (volume up to 10,000 dth per day) $70,000.00.

I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not sure how my cash department will wire the funds.  As of today, ENA has not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not anticipate very much activity on this deal.

Please let me know if anyone has questions.

Thanks

P.S.  Jim, according to Tallahassee, on February 27th that they requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth.  Would you have someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the worksheet please.

Thanks

who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn 
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

          Think this a great idea...he is just the ideal person to have on the lease
          and as standup and nice of a guy you would ever want to know. I'd give him a
          bid right away!!!

          Deer All:

          I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

          fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

          B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
          of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
          were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
          doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
          Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
          His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
          for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
          there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
          would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

          He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
          don't care about that.

          Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
          proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
          taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

          spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

          spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
          the fall back plan.

          Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


          Erik.

Marie -I am working the back end of a deal on Transwestern that Allegheny
may have an interest.

As part of a compression service deal on Transwestern, Enron Compressions
Service (a non-bankrupt Enron entity) is long approximately 12,000 /d of
physical gas at the West Texas Pool beginning Feb 02.  ECS receives these
molecules directly from TW. In turn, ECS converts the gas to cash in order
to pay a portion of the electric bill required to run the electric driven
compression.  With the bankruptcy of ENA, ECS is  looking for another
counter party to monazite the gas.  The contract has a small swing component
which is fixed (each month) during bid week.  The specifics are as follows:

	Contract #1:	Base 7,892 mmbtu/d through December 31, 2006
			   Swing (up only) of 1,120 mmbtu/d through December
31, 2006

	Contract #2	Base 3,462 mmbtu/d through May 31, 2010
			Swing (up only) of 595 mmbtu/d through July 31, 2010

Again TW delivers all molecules to the West Texas Pool.  We are willing to
consider a term of any length, but strongly prefer to sell the term.

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

"RE: Bridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals","Stuart,  I reviewed the Bridgeline binders.  I found a side letter agreement that addresses termination of the Transport and Storage Agreement.  Basically the letter provides LD's payable by ENA to Bridgeline for early termination.  Bridgeline get's kept whole for the intitial ten year term of the agreements.  For the transport deal, they get $0.025 for 150,000 MMBtu per day for the remaining ten year period and for the storage deal they receive $0.025 for 100,000 MMBtu per day for the remaining ten year period.  Both are NPV'd at a discount rate of 9%.  The side letter and the transport and storage agreements have no provisions affecting the Partnership upon early termination of those agreements.  I am researching the common carrier order and will get back later today.

Subject:	Bridgeline Partnership and Storage/Transportation Deals

Ed and Gerald,

Brian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14.  During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline.  Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens.  I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had.

Gerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above.

Ed, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.  If not, my guess is that you will be interested in hearing more.

"Sonat Park & Loan","Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

"Defining Debtor and Non-Debtor Companies","
Nothing about bankruptcy is easy, and because of Enron's size, ours is especially complex.  So it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of Enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy.

To clarify, debtor-in-possession, or debtor, companies are the legal entities of Enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the Creditors' Committee and the bankruptcy court.  Non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by Enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part, non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual.  The estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of Enron, which include some holdings in non-debtor companies.  It is important to note that at the beginning of March there were approximately 20,000 Enron employees in non-debtor companies, and about 3,500 Enron employees in debtor companies.

Distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program.  As we work through restructuring, components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies.  For example, earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business.

Another example is severance.  Going forward, we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce.  Given the uncertainty of our situation, we realize the importance of providing a ""safety net.""  Severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future.  Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees.  This was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  While the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies, severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval.  Employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention.

Retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees, primarily those in debtor companies.  Retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity, to liquidate non-core assets, or to unwind the affairs of the estate.  Retention is not a measure of past performance, but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.

Additionally, we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies.  Supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees.

We hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses, but more importantly, we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees.

I just met with the move coordinator.  We are now scheduled to move to the 4th floor, however, the information collected in the meeting will need to be approved.  Needless to say the churn will not have to be submitted today.  

The following issues were discussed in the meeting today:

	Fax Machine/Lines	TBD (I will process the churn for all fax lines)
	Churn Due Date		Thursday, January 17 (tentative)
	Move Date		Tuesday, January 21 (tentative)
	Boxes			Will be moved by move team (if staff is available)
	Filing Space		Please get with your group and determine what files can be achieved if any (space is being looked at)
	
Once move to locations have been determined an email will need to be sent to your group requesting that they go to that location box the items if any and label the boxes with the name, location and unit(label with flag nearest to that location).

Thanks

Hello Everyone,

I was just informed that churns for our move to the 3rd floor are due today by 5:00 p.m.   I will have the move to locations for your group to you as soon as possible.  Please begin inputting the information for your churn ASAP and once I provide you with your new locations you can plug them in.

For coding please use your current cost center and company number.  For manager information please put my contact information.  This information is used by the move team as an alternate contact for questions regarding your churn.  I will also need to get with you on whether or not you need to move any additional equipment other than the phone line for your group.  Equipment will only be moved if the location you will be moving into does not have that particular equipment needed or if there is a business reason why the equipment must be moved.  I realize the inconvenience this may cause and apologize in advance.  

Please leet me know if you have any questions or need any assistance with your churn.

Thank you.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Subject:	Bridgeline

I got a call from Randy Curry who wants to get together with Don and me tomorrow at 2pm.  I haven't checked with Don to see if he is available but they want to talk about our willingness/desire to move forward on the sale of the pad gas to Bridgeline and also our ability/willingness to pay them pre-petition amounts due under ENA storage/transport contracts.  As each of you are aware, they are holding approximately 1.9 BCF of ENA's gas hostage as security for ENA's obligations under the storage/transport contracts.  Gerald is not convinced that they are entitled to do so and my understanding is that a decision has been made to play hard ball with Bridgeline on those s/t contracts.  I wanted to confirm that.  Please let me know.

On the sale of pad gas to Bridgeline, Brian and I need to speak with Gulf South tomorrow morning (as they have expressed an interest in buying the gas directly from us (instead of buying through Bridgeline which is why Bridgeline is interested in buying from us)).  Brian is of the view that by talking to Gulf South we may be able to maximize the amount that is ultimately paid.

I think we still have some legal questions about Louisiana state law the need to be answered in order to make a fully informed decision.  My understanding is that Gerald is working on getting answers to these questions.  Also, Gerald was working on determining what approvals are needed in order to move forward under these potential sales scenarios.

Please let me know what each of you is thinking on these matters.  It probably makes sense to get together to discuss.  How about tomorrow at 1:30pm?  Please let me know if you are available.  Thanks

My view is that we cannot return this without court approval.  I assume
that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.

By now, you are aware that I am leaving Enron to pursue another career opportunity.  

I have sincerely enjoyed working with all of you.  You are a world class group of people who have a lot to be proud of.

As I have encouraged you before:

look forward
have fun
make the time that you are here an exciting employment experience where you can add value and learn
this environment provides a rich learning experience -- as you are maximizing value, soak it up

I wanted to share with you a quote from the Invensys press release announcing my appointment.  Invensys' CEO, Rick Haythornthwaite, said, ""In the aftermath of the Enron collapse, we should not lose sight of the fact that the company contained many good people and real businesses.""  Obviously, your hard work and efforts are recognized.

I wish you the best of business and personal good fortune as you move forward.  If I can ever be of any assistance, please let me know.

Regards,

Dan

"Florida swing supplier","Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

How about this?  It may be too formal, but I don't know how well you know
this guy.  Call me before you send it.

Paul,

Thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and several other
nice people over there this afternoon.  They seem like a great group to work
with.  The position sounds very interesting and like it would be a good
opportunity.  Hopefully, something will work out.  Again, I really
appreciate your efforts.

CLINTON HELPED ENRON FINANCE PROJECTS ABROAD 

Patrice Hill
THE WASHINGTON TIMES

-----------------------------------------------------------

The Clinton administration provided more than $1 billion in
subsidized loans to Enron Corp. projects overseas at a time
when Enron was contributing nearly $2 million to Democratic
causes.

Clinton officials refused to finance only one out of 20
projects proposed by the energy company between 1993 and
2000 to build power plants, natural-gas pipelines and other
big-ticket energy facilities around the world, according to
the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment
Corp., the agencies that provided the subsidies.

In addition, the administration, which lauded Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay as an exemplary ""corporate citizen,"" granted
about $200 million worth of insurance against political
risks for nine Enron projects in such politically volatile
areas as Argentina, Venezuela and the Gaza Strip, according
to documents the agencies provided to the Senate Finance
Committee.

""These projects obviously were a tremendous benefit to
Enron's operations,"" said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa
Republican and ranking minority member of the committee. He
noted that the Reagan and Bush administrations approved no
loans for Enron between 1985 and 1992 and provided insurance
for only one Enron power project in Guatemala in 1992.

The Clinton administration provided three loans between 1994
and 1998 to the now-defunct Dabhol power project in India.
Mr. Clinton's commerce secretary, Ron Brown, trumpeted the
approval of the Dabhol loans on a trade mission to India in
1995, with Mr. Lay by his side.

The trip was one of 11 Clinton trade missions provided at
taxpayer expense for corporate executives from Enron and
other companies. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency,
which sponsored the trips, also provided $1 million in
funding to study Enron energy projects in Russia, Eastern
Europe and former Soviet states.

As congressional committees dig for evidence to tie Enron
and Mr. Lay to the Bush administration, evidence of Mr.
Lay's links to the Clinton administration are ample and
well-documented.

Mr. Lay at times was Mr. Clinton's golf partner and slept in
the Lincoln Bedroom. Other top Enron officials attended the
White House's infamous ""coffee klatches"" with Mr. Clinton,
according to published reports.

Mr. Lay offered a seat on Enron's board of directors to
Robert E. Rubin, Mr. Clinton's Treasury secretary, in 1999
just before he left government, the Associated Press
reported yesterday. Mr. Rubin tried to get Treasury to
intervene on behalf of Enron last fall when the company
credit rating was threatened.

In May 1996, Mr. Clinton lauded Mr. Lay as a good ""corporate
citizen"" at a White House event because of Enron's
enlightened personnel policies, including profit-sharing of
Enron stock and generous health and pension benefits. Enron
employees now are suing because those benefits are as
worthless as the bankrupt company's stock.

During the Clinton years, Enron contributed more than $1
million to the Democratic Party, including $600,000 to the
Democatic National Committee, according to Federal Election
Commission records. Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
received contributions of $11,000 and $13,750, respectively,
for their presidential campaigns.

One $100,000 contribution to the DNC was provided before
India gave final approval to Enron's Dabhol project in June
1996. The largest and most expensive capital project ever
undertaken in India, Dabhol was of dubious economic value
and never went on line.

The World Bank, on reviewing the project, said it was not
economically viable and inordinately benefited Enron, which
was a 65 percent owner. Enron still owes $203 million on an
Export-Import Bank loan for the project, which the bank says
is covered by guarantees provided by five Indian banks.

Congressional aides said it is not clear what the taxpayers'
liability will be for that and other loans now that Enron is
bankrupt. The Export-Import Bank said its loans were
extended to overseas subsidiaries of Enron and not the
bankrupt corporation. The overseas investment agency said
its exposure is limited to paying any missed premiums on
Enron's political risk insurance.

Top Clinton officials lobbied personally to obtain Indian
state guarantees for the Dabhol project after it encountered
early problems in 1995. Thomas F. ""Mack"" McLarty, the White
House chief of staff, made it a top administration priority
to keep the project from failing. The Bush administration
has continued efforts to salvage the project.

Clinton Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary led a succession of
missions to India, and Mr. Clinton's ambassador to India,
Frank Wisner, was charged with keeping the project afloat.
After Mr. Wisner left government in 1997, he took a seat on
the board of directors of a company then controlled by
Enron. Mr. McLarty also performed work for Enron after
leaving the administration.

"FW: requested historical extract","PWC has now completed loading the Truequote data into the templates for the basis curves which we were able to cross reference.  Sorry, but it appears that they are having some issues with the index quotes, but I will keep you posted.  I will be passing out an updated list with the cross references so that you can quickly identify which curves now have Truequote in them.  These curves are now available so that you can begin shaping and revising them.  As you complete the curves, please remember to update the status report so that PWC can begin taking a look at the completed work.  The progress report has been modified to include a field for quotes entered as well as when the revisions are completed by each trader.
 
Also,  Tim has listed below the contact and phone number of the Truequote representative if you would like to contact him to see if you can more easily match up the remaining Truequote curves with the Enron curves.

"RE: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT","Ok...I thought the addition of ""life partners"" to the table simply intensified the revelry normally associated with ""Man Night""...                 it was like the testosterone crescendoed to its normal Deer-lease range once the ""other side"" joined our fray. Up until that point, I thought everyone's mini-meetings regarding isolated work-related gibberish was very non Man-like, almost to the point of boredom. Thank God ""They"" arrived b/c they brought out the best in the ""Men"".

It was either that or the $190.00 worth of alcoholic beverages that did it.

RE: The food...

Salsa was uninspired...but had good bite.
Queso is queso when doctored with proper amounts of capsicum, thus pushing the Scoville Units up to an acceptable level.
Mexican Seafood Cocktail...Good effort at the traditional version, albeit the least adventuresome. They make one that has shrimp,crab, octopus, squid, fish, etc. that would have gone over even better with the organ meat eaters. Does not compare to Goode Co.'s version, which is Tex-Mex'ized. Must be why Joe thought it was Ketchup....This version,  which I have eaten in Mexico is nothing more than Ceviche'ized random seafood, Pico, and the Mexican equivalent of V8 juice. Served with lime wedges and saltine crackers, like the natives do it.

Fish and Shrimp Main Course....Thought the fish was exceptionally fresh and tasty. Enjoyed the ""Diablo"" version the best w/ the corn tortillas and Guacamole. Very unique item seldom seen on menus. Would go back just for that. The shrimp suffered from too long in the fryer disease. It needs to be started in the fryer, cooked 1/4 of the way to render the bacon fat away, then finished over a char-grill to give it a smoky flavor. That step seemed to have been left out...fryer the whole time. They probably don't even have a char-grill.

Ritas- ""Rocas"" were good, Frozen was non-descript. Dos XX reliable as always. Perhaps we will get Michaladas next time, as discussed.
Overall...I'd go back, like I said, just for that fish!!!!

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander, 
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn 
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

Joe Parks and I talked with Rick Miles at Entex this afternoon.  He agreed to all terms.  We are waiting for them to reply with final concurrence on the $2.05 price/dth for the storage inventory.  

I stated that the early termination is subject to bankruptcy court approval.  That didn't bother Rick too much.  He acknowledged that Entex commercial-side needed their attorney's sign-off as well (but didn't think there would be an issue).

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

"Reinstatement of the Savings Plan Match","
To:  Participants of the Enron Corp. Savings Plan
From:  Enron Benefits Department

Several weeks ago, we announced that beginning July 1, 2002, the company would again match employees' eligible contributions to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan (""the Plan"").  We also announced that from July 1 through December 31, 2002, Enron would double the rate of the company match that was in effect prior to the suspension.  Based on your questions and feedback, we want to further clarify the double match and share with you some further modifications we are making to the administration of the match.

Doubling the Match
Doubling the match will accelerate the rate at which company matching contributions accumulate. However, the annual company matching contributions remain limited to 50 percent of an employee's pre-tax contributions, up to 6 percent of eligible compensation.

For example, assume a participant contributes the 2002 Federal pre-tax maximum of $11,000 to the Plan.  The company match in effect prior to its suspension was $.50 for each $1 contributed, so the maximum amount the employee would have received in company matching contributions would have been $5,500, or half of $11,000. With the double match, the same participant will receive $1 for each $1 contributed, but the match will not exceed $5,500.  Likewise, if a participant contributes $8,000 pre-tax during 2002, the company matching contribution would equal $4,000.  

""Truing Up"" the Match for Previous Contributions
Many participants in the Plan expressed concern that contributions to the Plan prior to July were not eligible for the reinstated company match.  To rectify this, we are modifying the administration of the match for the remainder of 2002.

Employees who were active as of December 31, 2001, and who participate in the Plan, will receive the double match for contributions made after July 1, 2002.  If at the end of 2002, the matched amount falls short of the maximum level possible based on the participant's annual pre-tax contributions to the Plan, the company will ""true up"" their match for 2002 to ensure the company contributions equal what would have been received had the match not been suspended.

For example, if an active employee's annual pre-tax contribution to the Plan will reach $11,000, and on July 1 the employee has already contributed $7,000, the remaining employee pre-tax contribution allowed will be $4000.  With the double match, the employee will receive $4,000 in company matching contributions between July and December, but will be $1,500 short of the company matching contributions he or she would have otherwise received.  On December 31, 2002, the employee's company matching contributions would be trued up with $1,500.

New Hires and Rehires After January 1, 2002
Any participants in the Plan hired or re-hired after January 1, 2002, will not be eligible for the double match.  Instead, they will receive the same match level in effect prior to suspension of the company match.  However, at the end of the year, they too will receive a true up to reach the maximum company match contributions for their annual pre-tax employee contribution.

Terminations Prior to December 31, 2002
If a Plan participant's employment is terminated involuntarily prior to December 31, 2002, the true up will take place as early as practical after termination.  The total amount of company matching contributions, including any true up, will be based on year-to-date contributions up to the time the participant is terminated.

If a Plan participant resigns voluntarily, he or she is not eligible for a true up, but will receive the double match on any pre-tax contributions made to the Plan between July 1 and his or her termination.

Participating in the Plan
Active Enron employees who are not currently participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan have until 3:00 p.m. CST on Thursday, June 27, 2002 to enroll in the Plan for their first July payroll contribution to be matched.  The same deadline applies to active participants in the Plan who may wish to increase their Savings Plan contribution rate in time for the first July payroll.  (For now, participants can only increase their contribution rate to the current maximum of 15 percent of their base salary.  After July 1, participants will be able to increase their contribution rate to the new maximum of 50 percent.)

To enroll in the Savings Plan or make a change to your current contributions, please log on to <<http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>>, or call the Benefit Service Center at 1-800-332-7979, option 3.

Subject: RE: age of joe's deer


I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen that 10 point I shot ""on the hoof"", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out lower jaw for inspection, you would have said ""Damn, that's an old deer."" 
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler formation (9"" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side, the younger one looked like a ""thoroughbread Horse"", while mine looked like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together about what ""formula"" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10 point was ""Mature and on his way down"" while the young one (Same deer that Keith has seen, too) is ""Mature and on his way up"". The last thing I have to say about that was that the ""Young"" deer of the two was definitely the ""dominant"" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my ""ol' bastard"" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to ""pour the Chili"" while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the ""stud"", ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stud, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anything. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and doesn't ""disappear"" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from year to year.

"Bridgeline","I just spoke with Hugh Connett of Bridgeline 

Here's what happened:

1)  He wanted to make sure that we were OK with April minus 3 cents but he wanted to lock in the price on the March settlement date (Joe Parks suggests that we should lock in promptly after we get approval on the deal and not wait until the end of February - this probably works unless we can't get approval by the end of Feb.).  We should probably talk a bit more about this with Bridgeline;

2)  He is going to revise the term sheet and send it to us.  It will include (a) pad gas payment of $2.08MM and (b) B-Line to make Q4 2001 and Q1 2002 lease payments to Dow and pay any credits back to Enron (He needed to check on this but said that it sounded OK); 

3)  He suggested that we should consider using $100k of the sales proceeds to fund the arbitration against TEPI (I asked him whether Bridgeline would be willing to fund the arbitration and he suggested this as an alternative); and

4)  We talked for a bit about the Storage/Transport Agreement - he said that they were willing to release the gas in storage to the extent that they are over-secured.  The big question is the value of the gas in storage.  I sought clarification on this because of our meeting this morning.  He said that he was going to figure out how much ENA owed under the Storage/Transport and then seek to convert that into an amount of gas.  Any gas in excess of that amount would be released.  In order to do this, however, he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald.

Effective this Friday, April 19, IntercontinentalExchange is listing two new hubs for the Gas Daily Financial Spread, NG Fin FP Spr, GDD/GDD. For ANR-SW and NGPL-Mid, bal month and prompt month strips will be added.

"RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the Second of my 10 daily emails","I spoke with Gary Chapman regarding the fee.  He references Section 6.5 of the Agreement which says ""ECS will pay Dow a brining fee of twenty cents ($0.20) per ton (2,000 pounds) of salt removed from the ESC well ......

We need to come up with the legal arguement linking it to bbls of capacity created, as the language of the agreement bases the fee on the amount of salt removed.

He said the $167,000 estimate came from using the Sonar measurement to determine the amount of salt removed.

Lets talk Monday.

Subject:	RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien .  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  [Zisman, Stuart]  This sounds like the right way to go.  Joe Parks should visit with the appropriate person at Bridgeline to figure out how much gas they are willing to release and try to get it sold.  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.

Subject:	Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process  [Zisman, Stuart]  Gerald when you are able to figure out what must be done please advise. will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02.  [Zisman, Stuart]   The Bridgeline folks said something about an August date and then adding 110 days to that and then adding 114 days to that.  Does that make any sense to you? 

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. 

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.   [Zisman, Stuart]  Brian would you please call Gary to find out what this is all about? 

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern.  [Zisman, Stuart]    Is there any downside to doing it early?  Might we lose negotiating leverage?  If not, we should consider trying to do this as a good faith gesture. 

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

My view is that we cannot return this without court approval.  I assume
that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.

			B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head

			were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and

			Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
			His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
			for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
			there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
			would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.
			
			He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
			don't care about that.
			
			Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
			proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
			taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two
			
			spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this
			
			spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
			the fall back plan.

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

"FROM CINDY OLSON, COMMUNITY RELATIONS: Body Shop Reopening","Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

"PGE Sale Agreement Terminated","We want to update you on a new development related to our bankruptcy and our efforts to structure a new company.

Enron's sale agreement with Northwest Natural Gas to sell Portland General Electric will be terminated.  The termination is a mutual decision between our company and Northwest Natural and is subject to bankruptcy court approval.  Our bankruptcy added unforeseeable complications that prohibited the sale being completed as originally structured.

Once the sale agreement is terminated, we will plan to move forward with PGE as part of our existing energy asset platform while continuing to evaluate options related to PGE.

Subject:	RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien .  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  [Zisman, Stuart]  This sounds like the right way to go.  Joe Parks should visit with the appropriate person at Bridgeline to figure out how much gas they are willing to release and try to get it sold.  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.

Subject:	Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process  [Zisman, Stuart]  Gerald when you are able to figure out what must be done please advise. will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02.  [Zisman, Stuart]   The Bridgeline folks said something about an August date and then adding 110 days to that and then adding 114 days to that.  Does that make any sense to you?  [Redmond, Brian] I think they have a valid point here in that the 110 days equates to the time required to inject the pad gas and the 114 days equates to the time required to inject the working gas. 

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable.  [Redmond, Brian]  We need to better understand what payments or obligations that Dow says are outstanding that would carry over to Bridgeline. 

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.   [Zisman, Stuart]  Brian would you please call Gary to find out what this is all about?  [Redmond, Brian]  Will do.

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern.  [Zisman, Stuart]    Is there any downside to doing it early?  Might we lose negotiating leverage?  If not, we should consider trying to do this as a good faith gesture.  [Redmond, Brian]  My view is that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  We should get this done as the enemy of a good deal is a better deal.2  

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

Stuart

"Re: duuuuhhhhh","Actually, if you leave RIGHT NOW you might make it to KC for the last half 
hour of shooting time for the winter dove season, which closes today.
Now, after that you've got duck season. But you'll have to talk to BC about 
that.
Last, you've got snow crow season that lasts till long after they have flown 
north again. I still haven't gone on a tape hunt and this year might be a 
good one to do it. Lots of young birds. Anyone interested in exploring this 
option??

If none of those fit the bill, Schleicher bunny season opens in April. And 
we hope that Chet will be joining us as a lease member.

"Organizational Changes","To: Enron Employees Worldwide 
From: Stephen Cooper 
Date: Wednesday, May 1, 2002

It is with mixed emotion that I confirm that Dan Leff will be leaving Enron in mid-May.  Dan was approached by and has accepted an excellent position with another company.  Dan recently stepped up to manage the wholesale and retail businesses.  In a short time, he has developed a solid team and a clear plan that can move forward under the direction of Bob Semple from Zolfo Cooper and our funtional leaders including Jeremy Blachman, Anthony Dayao, Eric Holzer, Kyle Kitagawa, Don Miller, Vicki Sharp, Ed Smida, and Wade Stubblefield.  I am sorry to lose Dan, but I want to congratulate him and wish him well in his new career.

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"Flows","In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

> Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting
> improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its

> We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly
> some of our EES MTM positions.

to

> To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow
of
> $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle
> (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later
years.
> Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?
> We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via
our
> swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly - Avici
> by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by
> 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't

>
> RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk;
> however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM.
> If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no
> commitment to contribute more equity.
> The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of
> Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.
> Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor
> entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.
> As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the
> equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying
> securities.
> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying
> capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing
> for reserves against our MTM positions.
> To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we ""enhanced""
> the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.
> My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must ""enhance""
> the vehicles by $250 million.
> I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a
lot
> of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment.
> None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed
> in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of
Waste
> Management (news/quote

</redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custo

> The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the

> My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the

capitalized,
> the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the

> I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly

> Summary of Raptor Oddities:

> a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a
related

> b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except
> Enron.
> c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a

> One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its

> find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will
lose

"Entex","I apologize for the continual stream of questions on this deal.  But here come more...

I have been asked to prepare a high level cash flow statement depicting the timing of funds relating to this deal.  I know that the Nov'01 invoice was late to go out because of the holidays and various illness.  Do you have any idea when the Dec'01 invoice will be prepared and sent to Entex?  And what is the normal schedule for this deal's invoice (given that it must be made manually)?

Also, if we were to negotiate an early termination with Entex wherein Enron service would end 1/31/02, how long after that point would it be before we knew the final storage inventory balance?

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. [Zisman, Stuart]  Why is there still a question as to Greg's willingness to move forward? 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe. [Zisman, Stuart]  This sounds like the right approach. 

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward. [Zisman, Stuart]    Good.

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

Subject:	Defining Debtor and Non-Debtor Companies


Nothing about bankruptcy is easy, and because of Enron's size, ours is especially complex.  So it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of Enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy.

To clarify, debtor-in-possession, or debtor, companies are the legal entities of Enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the Creditors' Committee and the bankruptcy court.  Non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by Enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part, non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual.  The estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of Enron, which include some holdings in non-debtor companies.  It is important to note that at the beginning of March there were approximately 20,000 Enron employees in non-debtor companies, and about 3,500 Enron employees in debtor companies.

Distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program.  As we work through restructuring, components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies.  For example, earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business.

Another example is severance.  Going forward, we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce.  Given the uncertainty of our situation, we realize the importance of providing a ""safety net.""  Severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future.  Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees.  This was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  While the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies, severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval.  Employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention.

Retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees, primarily those in debtor companies.  Retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity, to liquidate non-core assets, or to unwind the affairs of the estate.  Retention is not a measure of past performance, but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.

Additionally, we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies.  Supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees.

We hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses, but more importantly, we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees.

Subject: Deer Lease Report

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost on pre-petition retainage?

Forwarding Kieth's report from last weekend of doe season.

Had to call him to get information on what made his heart race.

He saw Mertz's rib cage buck at boneyard, other side of the fence, said it
was 14 inches wide with tines that were incredibly long almost touching at
the top. he said 140plus, no problem.

saw brian's deer's younger brother at lonestar and said it will be a great
bucknext year.

While spotlighting bunnys saw a buck at the protien feeder at launching pad
that was unbelivable. He said he counted 12 scorable points, not including
several kickers he did not count. the deer was wide with aobut 8 to 9 inch
tines. walked with a limp on front right leg. Must be a nocturnal old
warrior, never seen before.

other than that he saw a smattering of does and yong bucks. feeders still
running.  e.

Subject: CPN's ($12.50/sh) New Credit Facility--Is it enough?


WE DO NOT OFFICIALLY COVER CPN.

CPN released a press release stating that it had completed a portion of its
long awaited $2B credit line.  The new credit facility includes a new $1.0B
and an amended $400MM revolving credit facility (expiring May, 2004).  A 2
year $600MM term loan (as pre-released in the S&P press release a few weeks
ago) is expected to be completed within the next 30 days.  CPN has agreed
to pledge interest in its natural gas producing properties, the Saltend
power plant in the UK and its equity investments in nine US power plants.
The nine US power plants represent additional securitization relative to
the information included in the S&P press release (a negative relative to
expectations).

In addition, CPN presented a Sources and Uses of Cash estimate for FY02
that showed a cash cushion of $1.4B.  However, this estimate included $2.2B
in sources of cash that are contingent on future events.  Sources of cash
remaining to be secured include: 1) the $600MM term loan (expected to close
within 30 days), 2) a $500MM California peaker lease (difficult,
considering the fact that it is backed by a DWR contract that the Governor
is attempting to renegotiate), 3) the sale of $250MM in non-strategic
assets (expected to close by the end of 2Q), 4) a $300MM Canadian royalty
trust to monetize its Canadian powr generation assets (expected by the end
of 2Q), 5) a $150MM sale-leaseback of its Zion power plant (expected by the
end of 2Q), 6) $260MM financing of future turbine purchases that are
supported by long-term PPAs (no timing target set), and, 7) the sale of the
Gilroy accounts receivable from PG&E (which is in bankruptcy) of $175MM
(transaction could take place by the end of 3Q).  In addition, our combined
cycle spot margin indicators are suggesting that the spot market has been
very weak y-t-d ($3.75/MWh average margin and a 65% utilization rate)
relative to CPN's earnings guidance spot assumptions ($8/MWh margin and 70%
to 80% utilization), suggesting that CPN's earnings guidance ($1.70/sh) and
cash flow generation expectations may be too aggressive.

We continue to believe CPN is very speculative issue and that bankruptcy is
a real possibility.  Based on what we know about the name, we are sellers.

CPN has scheduled a conference call today at 10am PST, 12pm CT and 1pm ET.
The dial in number is 973-628-6885.

"I.D. Badges Charges / Plaza Java Coffee Kiosk","
As Steve Cooper indicated in the employee meeting, we are undertaking efforts to improve the work environment at Enron.  Two such initiatives are being kicked off next week.

First, employees will be able to reinstate I.D. badge purchase privileges.  Beginning Tuesday, April 16, 2002, current Houston-based Enron employees will be able to activate their employee I.D. badge to make purchases at the Energizer, Express Store, and the Plaza Java Coffee kiosk.  Charges will be deducted directly from their paycheck.

To activate your I.D. badge for purchases, please follow the steps outlined below:  
?	Complete a new I.D. badge charge form.  Forms may be picked up at any cash register in the Energizer, Express Store, and Plaza Java.  A printable form is attached below for your convenience.  
?	Sign and date the form.  Doing so authorizes Payroll to deduct charges from your semi-monthly paychecks.  Unsigned and undated forms will be returned to the applicant.  
?	Return the form to Richard Hensch at EB1653a, or to any cashier at the above locations.
?	Allow three days for activation.  

Additionally, there is good news for coffee drinkers.  Beginning Monday, April 15, the operating hours for the Plaza Java coffee kiosk will be extended to 4:00 p.m. for a two-week trial basis.  During that time, participation will be monitored to determine whether the later closing time will be continued.

Questions may be referred to mailto:Richard.Hensch@enron.com.

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

Subject: Fishing or Golf?


Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?
 
If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.
 
Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?
 
Chad, the time in the ""stall"" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.

"RE: Prepays to Reliant and Dominion","I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion for tomorrow.  All of these request are signed and on Doug's desk.

Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract
		10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00

Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

                                         deal on Florida





I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

Kay

Subject:	Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, ""Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months"".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?


Any comments or questions?

Rick,

The l/c is still in effect. Based on the language of the l/c, in order to
terminate the l/c, JPMorgan Chase would have had to notify Lone Star Gas if
its intent to not renew at least 30 days prior to the maturity date. Given
that such notice was not provided, the maturity date was automatically
extended for 12 months. The l/c is currently scheduled to expire on Jan 11,
2003, and continues to be governed by the ""evergreen"" feature.

Hi Rob:

I'm hoping you can help with this.  Lone Star is asking to verify that the
LC required under the gas transportation agreement between Lone Star Gas
Co. and Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. is presently in effect per the
terms of that agreement.  Jeff Smirin at TXU is looking at the document you
sent to me earlier today.  He would like verification (which I think needs
to come from you) that there has been no termination and that LC#770769 is
effective through 1/11/03.

Please confirm these facts by responding to this e-mail with a Cc: to
jeffsmirin@txu.com.

Thanks,

Rick Hill

					Deer All:
					
					I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to
					
					fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).
					
					B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
					of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
					were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
					doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
					Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
					His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
					for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
					there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
					would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.
					
					He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
					don't care about that.
					
					Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
					proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
					taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two
					
					spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this
					
					spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
					the fall back plan.
					
					Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.
					
					
					Erik.

Fish products(incl. eye): Yummy
Red fish dip: agreed on the thick V-8, of course we gringos have always been accused of over-doing Mex. fair, hence Tex-Mex, Pappasitos has made millions over doing Mex food.

Glad to see Chompers out!  I say lets invite one other individual every time that we can disturb--kinda like a deer lease interview.

Subject: RE: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT
 
Ok...I thought the addition of ""life partners"" to the table simply intensified the revelry normally associated with ""Man Night""...                 it was like the testosterone crescendoed to its normal Deer-lease range once the ""other side"" joined our fray. Up until that point, I thought everyone's mini-meetings regarding isolated work-related gibberish was very non Man-like, almost to the point of boredom. Thank God ""They"" arrived b/c they brought out the best in the ""Men"".

It was either that or the $190.00 worth of alcoholic beverages that did it.

RE: The food...

Salsa was uninspired...but had good bite.
Queso is queso when doctored with proper amounts of capsicum, thus pushing the Scoville Units up to an acceptable level.
Mexican Seafood Cocktail...Good effort at the traditional version, albeit the least adventuresome. They make one that has shrimp,crab, octopus, squid, fish, etc. that would have gone over even better with the organ meat eaters. Does not compare to Goode Co.'s version, which is Tex-Mex'ized. Must be why Joe thought it was Ketchup....This version,  which I have eaten in Mexico is nothing more than Ceviche'ized random seafood, Pico, and the Mexican equivalent of V8 juice. Served with lime wedges and saltine crackers, like the natives do it.

Fish and Shrimp Main Course....Thought the fish was exceptionally fresh and tasty. Enjoyed the ""Diablo"" version the best w/ the corn tortillas and Guacamole. Very unique item seldom seen on menus. Would go back just for that. The shrimp suffered from too long in the fryer disease. It needs to be started in the fryer, cooked 1/4 of the way to render the bacon fat away, then finished over a char-grill to give it a smoky flavor. That step seemed to have been left out...fryer the whole time. They probably don't even have a char-grill.

Ritas- ""Rocas"" were good, Frozen was non-descript. Dos XX reliable as always. Perhaps we will get Michaladas next time, as discussed.
Overall...I'd go back, like I said, just for that fish!!!!

OUT

Subject: RESULTS OF MAN NIGHT

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander, 
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how 
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and ""grapes"" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn 
down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for 
being most ""in"" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

Chris,  Can you request that Centana provide us with their lawyers info, so I can contact him.  It is not unreasonable for them to specify the grounds under which they are holding our gas.  They are in violation of the automatic stay is they do not return our gas and I will point this out to their attorney.

Subject:	Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien

Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its claim against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged from ""if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas from you"" to ""we are holding the gas till you pay us""  Based on Joe's discussions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to stored gas appears small.

Our most probable options appear to be:

 (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / colorable warehouseman's lien
       (post petition amounts are already approved);
 (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st day order;
 (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC;
 (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if available.

My preference is option (1) as :
	-	option (2) is the most unlikely, 
	-	option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we continue to accrue storage costs, and
	-	option (4) holds significant transaction risk.

Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Funding Request (""BFR"").

Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR?

Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed with (1) above?

ENRON POSTS JOBS
The company is reinstituting a job posting process to help fill open positions.  In the midst of restructuring, the number of job openings is understandably limited.   However, postings will be updated regularly.  Within the job posting system called jobOps, an employee can apply for a position by using their current employee profile as their resume or modify it to create an updated resume.  Employee's can still update their profile information in eHRonline.  At this time, only current employees will be able to apply for a position from within jobOps.  You may access current postings by visiting https://hrglobal.enron.com/JobOps.  The system can also be reached by clicking on the jobOps link from http://Home.enron.com or http:hrweb.enron.com.  

COMPANY RESUMES SERVICE AWARDS
Enron has resumed its Service Awards Program to recognize employees' years of service to the organization.  Employees in both debtor and non-debtor companies are eligible to receive service awards upon their employment anniversary every five years.  Employees who are nearing an employment anniversary or passed an anniversary while the program was suspended will soon receive by mail a brochure and order form that allows them to select their individual gift.  The selection of gifts has recently been updated yet still includes favorites such as pen and pencil sets, knives, jewelry or grandfather clocks depending on an employee's years of service to the company.  Service award notification, gift catalogues, and order forms will be available to eligible employees online in the near future.

The joy of going to college in Texas....
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS I live in a town where you stand out if you don't have a purple Mohawk, facial piercing chained to nipple piercing, a homosexual lover, or hang out at the Magnolia Cafe. More people go to my school than live in Australia. I honestly believe that Ricky Williams is a god. I am open-minded and spiritually in tune - except towards people who are closed-minded and spiritually out of tune. You can see my dorm from Chicago for it is as tall as Florida would be if it stood up. I protest everything -except protests. I am a gold card carrying member of Amnesty International. I am openly bi-curious. I am a Longhorn.

TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY I live in a town the size of a piece of
bacteria on a fly's ass. I spend Friday nights practicing my yells. 
I can whoop better than anyone can in my battalion. I beat up faggots for fun. If
I'm not yelling, drinking with my battalion, or beating up faggots 
for fun, I am at the Dixie Chicken. My father went to school here, just as his father
did before him, and his father before him. My brother went to tu. They never
found his body after he came home that first Christmas in college. I won't walk on the grass. I look forward to the day I, too, will do the elephant walk. I believe it is cool to do something because they tell me it is tradition. If something is not a tradition and we accidentally do it, we then make it one. I can call UT ""tu"" if I want. I am an Aggie. BAYLOR UNIVERSITY I live by homeless vagrants, whom I turn my
nose up I look just like everyone else at my school. The NoZe Brothers are the coolest things since khakis and sandals. I have an Abercrombie and Fitch everything. I can co-ordinate outfits and ensembles better than anyone in my
upscale apartment complex. I have radar that lets me know where the closest
ATM is. If I can't find one it's okay. I have ten credit cards all of which
to my parents. My town is so conservative that anyone who kisses on the mouth
before three years of marriage is drug through the town. I like me. I should be an underwear model. I am a Bear.

TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY I live on a piece of dirt so flat that we call the four degree incline at the intersection of 19th and Brownfield the big hill. I get dirt in my eyes, hair, and teeth when I walk to class. I can out drink anyone from any other school because that is what we do. If I'm not drunk by 4:30pm, I'm high. I can't buy beer within 50 miles of where I>live - so I trek to the strip, which my friends and I
all consider a true paradise on Earth. I don't go to many football games. I don't go to any organizational meetings. I don't really go to anything. Not even class. I like the fact that Will Rogers' horse's ass points to College Station. I fry cow balls. I know where Buddy Holly used to live. I am desperately trying to find a rival within our conference to make fun of. Our football players get caught by the NCAA. If I'm not drunk by 4:30pm, I'm high. But I'm usually drunk by 4:30pm. Or I'm high. I am 
a Red Raider.

THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS (UNT) I am either a film geek or a musician. If I am neither then you will find me hanging out on Fry Street dressed in my punk garb. I think my school sucks yet I still attend school here. I wear t-shirts and hats from either A&M or UT because I wish I could've gotten in there. On Thursdays you will find me shaking my thang at the Groovey Mule or down in Deep Ellum. I think Denton is the scuzziest town ever and I bitch about all the pot holes in the roads when I am driving anywhere in the city. Most of the people here are weird. Noone
stays on the weekends. Noone has ever even heard of my school. On Sundays,
the whole town goes to church at Denton Bible. Damn, I really wish I
could've gotten into one of the other Texas colleges. I am a mean green
Eagle. Cawwww!
TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY (TCU) I am in a frat or sorority of course. I drive a Lexus or Mercedes, and if I pass all my classes then Daddy said he would buy me that little condo on Hulen next semester. I wear my diamonds and heels for football games and get dressed for bed and  THEN go to the basketball games. Anyone and everyone goes to the Pub or Scooners, or to Longhorns and dance with old Mexican cowboys. We are having a J.Crew built in the bookstore next year and our send home credit cards apply at ALL times and locations. Where the girls' hair is as fake as their tans. The freshman 15 means nothing more to me than a new wardrobe. Where the girl to guy ratio is four to one and the only one getting any action is the rapist. Where the girls are girls, and so are the guys. I'm a Frog.

SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY (SMU) See the listing for Texas Christian University above...change 'Hulen' to 'Mockingbird'. I'm aMustang.

SFA STATE UNIVERSITY I am drunk or having sex right now. I went to class once. That about sums it up. I am a Lumberjack.

THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON I work all day or all night. I attend school part-time. I'm trying to get a degree, any degree, to help get a decent job. I live with my parents, and spend as little time on campus as possible. Football games?? You mean we have a football team??? When say my school is in an urban setting, I'm serious. In the shadows of the fourth largest city in the U.S., right in one of the most crime-ridden areas I go to school. I wish I could go to A&M, or any other big school and get a real degree. I wish I hadn't flunked out when I was attending a real
school. I'm a Cougar.

SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY (SWT) I tried to get into a real school, but couldn't. I spend most weekends tubing down the river in New Braunsfels drunk and/or high and naked, or getting drunk and acting stupid. I'm a Bobcat.

SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY (SHSU) I am a big time band nerd.
My favorite hobby is playing with my instrument. There are no attractive people at my school because we're all band geeks. At night, my flute is my best friend. I'm studying music so that I can become a licensed band geek leader and warp the minds of future generations. What the hell is a Bearkat, anyway?

TARLETON STATE UNIVERSITY I am a roper (""kicker""). My life revolves around bovines and sheep, and I like studying ""animal husbandry"", if you know what I mean. I either wear Wranglers that cut the circulation off to my unit, or Rockies that give me a major camel toe. I have a belt buckle the size of a dinner plate. My favorite beer is Coors Lite. I have a gun rack in the back of my pickup, which is a diesel with dual wheels. I am a Texan.

EAST TEXAS STATE Who cares? Does anybody go there? Isn't that
like a community college?

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in

I agree, we started out with 3, went to 1, no we are going in the wrong direction again.  By the way, wasn't Mertz supposed to add more acreage to this ranch?  I think we have hunted everything we can on ol' Autry.

Think this a great idea...he is just the ideal person to have on the lease
and as standup and nice of a guy you would ever want to know. I'd give him a
bid right away!!!

Subject: Possible new lease member

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Happy Administrative Professionals Day","
Today is Administrative Professionals Day -- the one day designated to recognize a year's worth of hard work performed by this group of dedicated professionals.  Although no small gesture can adequately convey the depths of our gratitude, we have made the following arrangements for Enron's administrative professionals in Houston as a token of our appreciation for their tremendous contributions.

First, each administrative professional will receive a gift certificate for up to $5 at Plaza Java.

The Body Shop will also hold a daylong open house Friday, April 26, with a special one-hour yoga class exclusively for administrative professionals at noon.  All administrative professionals are welcome to use the Body Shop at any time Friday regardless of whether they are a current member.  If you cannot work out on Friday, don't worry.  Administrative professionals will also receive a guest certificate to use the Body Shop one day that they choose during May.

Finally, administrative professionals will receive a certificate for $5 off the cost of a massage at the Body Shop.  Then, when they present their certificate at the time of their appointment, they will receive an additional $5 off the cost of a 30, 45, or 60 minute massage for a total discount of $10.  For more information or to schedule an appointment, call 713-853-3047.

The three certificates will be delivered to administrative professionals via interoffice mail.  If you have recently relocated or do not receive your gift certificates by Monday, April 29, please call Ginger McCain at 713-853-7725.

Thank you for all you do to make our jobs easier and our lives better.

"RE: MAN NIGHT FINAL PLANS","I think it has to do w/ evolution of phrases.  In the 12th century, the
phrase was ""hairier than a butt tick"" (which doesn't make sense unless you
trace it back to days when man invented the three point stance), but went
through a series of common usefulness in differing global regions, ending in
Northern Iceland (where the women are beautiful, but it is very cold - get
the idea?).  The phrase didn't change much from there until the Salem Witch
Trials.  What I'm trying to figure out is how it ended-up at a rodeo.

Ok, hope that helps. I gotta get back to my oh-so-useful mgmt training

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about our
impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT CHANGE,
heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will be
Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO have
security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers
drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining next
to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of like a
good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the natives
eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and Chet, I
would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the non-English
speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

"FW: Dominion Producers","Recommendation for ENA Pools
1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow
3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.

I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  

Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
	1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
	2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
	3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.

Items to consider
If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.

Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.

Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

Subject:	RE: Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien .  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  [Zisman, Stuart]  This sounds like the right way to go.  Joe Parks should visit with the appropriate person at Bridgeline to figure out how much gas they are willing to release and try to get it sold.  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.

Subject:	Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process  [Zisman, Stuart]  Gerald when you are able to figure out what must be done please advise. will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02.  [Zisman, Stuart]   The Bridgeline folks said something about an August date and then adding 110 days to that and then adding 114 days to that.  Does that make any sense to you? 

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. 

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.   [Zisman, Stuart]  Brian would you please call Gary to find out what this is all about? 

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern.  [Zisman, Stuart]    Is there any downside to doing it early?  Might we lose negotiating leverage?  If not, we should consider trying to do this as a good faith gesture. 

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

"Enron Compression update","FYI, Attached is a copy of the Enron Compression business cash flow status that I handed out at the meeting on Monday.  The Midland Power and GE Capital payments are still in process of being approved and are still on the 5 day list.

Also Troy Denetsosie is preparing a work flow document to chart the gas nomination and sales process for both the NNG and TW gas.  The February gas was nominated for both NNG and TW this week and Troy will be doucmenting the procedures for getting this gas scheduled, priced, sold, invoiced, and booked.  Once this is complete, I will be scheduling an update meeting with everyone to review this.  We can also review the rebate calculations and any other topics.

In addition I am still working on the Enron Compression LLC financials.  I have found booking errors on the ledger that need to be corrected as well as accruals and other entries that are need to be booked.  Ana, I will be sending you an email summarzing these.  Also please let me know if you need any information regarding the needed transfer of funds between Kachina, Gallup, and Hubbard.

"RE: More HPL money sent to ENRON","I think that is right.  So long as it is absolutely clear that the money was paid in error, return the money to El Paso that was erroneously sent by El Paso to ENA.

I am sending a carbon copy of this to Barbara Gray to confirm that I am giving the correct advice.

"FW: Florida swing supplier","Update on a new swing supplier as of 4:00 PM on Friday

I've called PanCanadian, e prime, Cinergy, Reliant, Coral, ONEOK, and Entergy-Koch.  I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.  The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay.  ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

Margaret, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call.

Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.

Subject:	Florida swing supplier

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

Subject: Possible new lease member

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"FW: Entex Transportation and Storage Costs","Ed, note that we have not paid the Nov'01 Tenn. invoice.  This invoice is pre-bankruptcy filing.  If I understand the world of bankruptcy, we will not pay the Nov'01 invoice but WILL pay the Dec'01 invoice (for the term 12/02/01 - 12/31/01).  Do you agree?  Do I need to instruct someone to make payment?

Louis,

We have not paid 11/01 production invoices for Tenn; therefore, we are not current on payments.  12/01 production payment is due 1/24/02.  Anything to be paid out must pass through committee due to our current bankruptcy situation.

Can you forward (electronically or via fax: 713-646-3460) a copy of the Tennessee transportation invoice associated with Entex?  Also, If there is a separate storage invoice, please send that as well.

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working

Attn:  Mr. Stuart Zisman
 
Subject:                 Napoleonville Pad Gas purchase and related transactions summary
 
Pursuant to our recent conversations, the following outlines the basic terms of a definitive agreement to be entered into by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. (""BHLP""), Bridgeline Storage Company LLC (""BSC""), LRCI, Inc. (""LRCI"") and such affiliates of LRCI as are necessary to effectively consummate the following transactions related to the Napoleonville storage caverns and the current Natural Gas Storage and Brine Service Agreement, as amended (""Brine Agreement""), between LRCI and Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources Inc (""DHRI""):
 
1)                   LRCI owns and agrees to sell to BSC the full volume of pad gas, which is agreed to be 4,075,500 Dth, in place in DRHI Caverns #13 and #14 in the Napoleonville area at a per unit price equal to the April 2002 NYMEX Close price as of February 26, 2002 (February 2002 contract settlement date) less $0.03/Dth to be effective March 1, 2002 (""Effective Date"").
2)                   LRCI shall assign the Brine Agreement to BSC by assignment effective March 1, 2002.  LRCI shall be responsible for satisfying any outstanding obligations under the Brine Agreement, except that BSC shall make the fourth quarter 2001 and prorated first quarter 2002 (January and February) lease payments as determined in the Brine Agreement directly to DHRI.  BSC shall remit to LRCI any amounts for the power and land credits which may be due LRCI under the Brine Service Agreement in respect of time periods prior to March 1, 2002, which as of the date hereof total $11,401.35.
3)                   LRCI shall pay, or cause its appropriate affiliates to pay, the following: (i) $223,000 to BSC to reimburse BSC for construction cost of the NS#1 dewatering line; (ii) $328,000 to BSC to reimburse BSC for construction cost of the NS#1 24"" gas flow line; and (iii) $2,080,386 to BSC for the final Pad Gas Payment; all such amounts being due in connection with the capital contributions obligations of LRCI and certain of its affiliates under the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement for Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. (""LP Agreement"").
4)                   The definitive agreement will be entered into on or before February 15, 2002 and will contain representations and warranties from LRCI that (i) LRCI and the affiliates of LRCI joining in the execution of the closing documents under such definitive agreement are all of the parties that are required to join in such documents in order to effectively consummate the transactions as contemplated, (ii) LRCI and all such affiliates have all requisite authority to enter into such transactions; and (iii) neither LRCI nor any of its affiliates joining in the transactions is, or will be at such closing, a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding.
 
The obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions described above are conditioned upon: (i) the simultaneous closing of all transactions described herein, (ii) LRCI's having completed and delivered to BSC, prior to such closing, all documentation necessary to evidence of record LRCI's earlier contribution under the LP Agreement of the Napoleonville Storage Well #1 tracts and the related rights of way for the 24"" gas flow line and the power easement to BSC's compression facility, and (iii) BSC's successful negotiation and contemporaneous execution of all agreements with third parties necessary to complete the transactions as contemplated, including without limitation agreements with DRHI to satisfactorily amend the Brine Agreement.
 
The parties agree that all payments due to LRCI at closing may be netted against the amounts that BSC will pay LRCI at closing and that BSC shall remit the balance to LRCI in full by wire transfer at such closing.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

I think that is right.  So long as it is absolutely clear that the money was paid in error, return the money to El Paso that was erroneously sent by El Paso to ENA.

I am sending a carbon copy of this to Barbara Gray to confirm that I am giving the correct advice.

"RE: Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida","
The Tallahassee deal still has value so we want the Dominion deal to stay in place.  I'm concerned about the 1st because all the money needs to be wired tomorrow.  At this point, I believe Dominion should supply the gas for April at the contract price regardless.

Let me know where we stand with Dominion by 1:30 PM today.

Subject:	Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

I called IT support about the corrupt basis ""IF-WAHA-TX.xls"" file.  They basically said that they don't have the Excel support to address the problem.
 
I talked with Joe Parks and he isn't having problems shaping/saving other files.  The problem appears 'to be isolated to the Waha file.
 
I'm willing to enter data again, but can we expect other broker quotes from PWC anytime soon?
 
Finally, I suggeted to Joe that he perform curve shaping for this file on my PC.

They had another one in the yard that was smaller & in good shape--it may go on sale at the next auction.  I am now on the list for future notices.

Interesting event.  You can literally go in there and buy a functional vehicle for $100 if no one else bids.  Today a nice van sold for $400.  They sold a tractor/trailer for $2500--truck load of skins or crack not included.
Hot item of the day was a 2001 F250 Super Duty 4x4 with 4000 miles on it, loaded, sold for $24000. The book on that truck is about $40K.   Flooded vehicles & other junkers available.  Fun stuff.

Gerald,
 
Joe Parks just indicated that Centana is willing to allow us to sell gas without paying them first.  Just as we first talked about with Bridgeline, they want to hold back an amount of inventory sufficient to cover the pre and post-petition demand charges.  My reaction is to sell the gas ASAP and worry about the remaining inventory later.  Please advise if this is a problem.  From my prior discussions with you, my understanding is that sales of gas by ENA are permitted without prior approval.  Let me know if that is not the case.
 
Thanks

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Rod,

Greg has requested that I forward the details of a misdirected wire that El Paso had sent to HPL in error and were unable to retrieve. Greg has attempted on several occasions to contact Lisa Mellencamp in regard to the situation without success. He indicated that if we forwarded the details to your attention you may provide some assistance.

Thanks and Regards.

	I have located where El Paso in error sent a wire transfer of $ 154,240 to Houston Pipeline ( based upon my understanding a non bankrupt entity ) instead of AEP on November 26. I spoke to Bryce Baxter, Manager of Settlements as to what could be done to get El Paso their funds. He stated that as a result of the Bankruptcy, Bank of America where the wire transfer was sent, seized the account and has frozen those funds. Bryce also stated that they did not intend to return the funds since they were originally for AEP and AEP owned $ 25M on November 26 and and another $ 45M on December 26. He stated these were the instructions from Lisa Mellencamp in their Legal group. Any thoughts or direction on where to go next?

	Thanks.

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

It probably makes sense to circle up on this on Monday and also to discuss a call that I received from Randy.  He indicated that we should probably sit down with Bridgeline to discuss the likelihood of acceptance/rejection of the storage/transport deal in order to potentially figure out what is most beneficial for both parties.

I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.

Subject:	Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. 

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. 

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. 

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

"Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan","Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, ""Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months"".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Marie -I am working the back end of a deal on Transwestern that Allegheny
may have an interest.

As part of a compression service deal on Transwestern, Enron Compressions
Service (a non-bankrupt Enron entity) is long approximately 12,000 /d of
physical gas at the West Texas Pool beginning Feb 02.  ECS receives these
molecules directly from TW. In turn, ECS converts the gas to cash in order
to pay a portion of the electric bill required to run the electric driven
compression.  With the bankruptcy of ENA, ECS is  looking for another
counter party to monazite the gas.  The contract has a small swing component
which is fixed (each month) during bid week.  The specifics are as follows:

	Contract #1:	Base 7,892 mmbtu/d through December 31, 2006
			Swing (up only) of 1,120 mmbtu/d through December
31, 2006

	Contract #2	Base 3,462 mmbtu/d through May 31, 2010
			Swing (up only) of 595 mmbtu/d through July 31, 2010

Again TW delivers all molecules to the West Texas Pool.  We are willing to
consider a term of any length, but strongly prefer to sell the term.

"RE: Tenaska Service Agreement","Not to be too obvious in all of the mess noted below but a little further framing of the issue seems appropriate.
 
The project has a total return swap structure in place.  We also have a potential sale of the project underway which could result in a significant positive amount being distributed to the estate.  How we handle the matter Rick notes below could impact our continuing involvement in the sales process and ultimately effect our ability to realize the distribution.

Subject: RE: Tenaska Service Agreement 


The desk has, since September 2000, provided ""agency services"" to the Cleburne, TX facility (owned by Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd., f/k/a Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd., which is owned by ECTMI (10%) and Ponderosa Pine Energy, LLC (90%), or ""PPEP"").  Agency services include gas scheduling/reconciliation, purchase/resale, and billing/payment of services provided under three contracts to which Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners is a party:

Lone Star - transport 
Apache - supply 
Williams - supply

An agreement covering these services was developed by Sandy Braband (no longer here) and never executed.  The desk received a fee of ~4.5 cents/Dth for the services.
 
Based on my conversations with James Armstrong, it appears that pipeline charges billed by Lone Star between April and September 2001 were billed by the desk to the project.  The project forwarded funds to the desk for payment of the Lone Star invoices, but the funds never went to Lone Star.  The total amount still due Lone Star for the period is $515, 985.41.  As the contract is between Lone Star and PPEP, the amount due must be settled in order to prevent defaults under the project-level loan agreement.  I believe a request has been submitted to you for payment of the total amount due.  My question is can the estate pay the amount due Lone Star or will the project need to remit funds directly to the pipeline and file a claim against the estate (effectively double-paying the amount due)?  To the extent it's the latter, it's the upstream parties (i.e., KBC/Delta Power) that will have an issue with what's happened, as any amounts trapped by the desk (and paid, for a second time, by PPEP) essentially come out of future cash distributions from the project company.
 
FYI, this is not the only issue that has arisen as a result of this arrangement.  According to James, the project company also paid the desk for October 2001 pipeline charges billed by Lone Star and subsequently paid the pipeline directly ($108,405) and is owed $600,377.50 for November 2001 gas sales made on behalf of the project.  We're also aware that a large imbalance has built up on Lone Star; Joe Parks is looking into taking care of this problem while we're determining what DPC/Delta Power wish to do with respect to gas management going forward.
 
Please call me at x3-6027 if you have any questions.

We can try.  The guy who managed this deal for the desk left the Company but I thought he handed it off to Rick Hill in the estate.  I will talk to the rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you.  My basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only and are agent for the plant.  I believe Rick Hill is the commercial contact on the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal.  I will get back to you.

Hey Tom,
Rita Wynne just called and let me know that we need to make a payment to TXU on behalf of Tenaska.  Since TXU has terminated agreements with us, the Cash Management Committee will not make payments to TXU unless they understand the deal that is in place with Tenaska and we show that Tenaska has already paid us their part.  Could you please help Chip Schneider, of Enron Underwriting, and myself get up to speed on this as quickly as possible.  TXU is threatening to take action on Tenaska.  Thanks for your help.

FYI - I have had numerous complains that the refrigerator in the main kitchen had a funny odor, and was told to call housekeeping. Housekeeping came by today to throw away food that was old, I monitored her and saw that she only threw away stuff that smelled bad or was already growing something on it! In order for her to air out the refrigerator she will need you to take your food home so that she is able to clean and sanitize the refrigerator.

Please see to it that you notify your group to take home all food containers.

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., EVP, FINANCE & TREASURER","To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"FW: Centana Storage Arrangement","Gerald,
 
Joe Parks just indicated that Centana is willing to allow us to sell gas without paying them first.  Just as we first talked about with Bridgeline, they want to hold back an amount of inventory sufficient to cover the pre and post-petition demand charges.  My reaction is to sell the gas ASAP and worry about the remaining inventory later.  Please advise if this is a problem.  From my prior discussions with you, my understanding is that sales of gas by ENA are permitted without prior approval.  Let me know if that is not the case.
 
Thanks

Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen that 10 point I shot ""on the hoof"", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out lower jaw for inspection, you would have said ""Damn, that's an old deer."" 
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler formation (9"" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side, the younger one looked like a ""thoroughbread Horse"", while mine looked like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together about what ""formula"" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10 point was ""Mature and on his way down"" while the young one (Same deer that Keith has seen, too) is ""Mature and on his way up"". The last thing I have to say about that was that the ""Young"" deer of the two was definitely the ""dominant"" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my ""ol' bastard"" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to ""pour the Chili"" while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the ""stud"", ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stud, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anything. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and doesn't ""disappear"" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from year to year.

Chip,

Attached are Stuart's comments to the DASH.  Pretty minor wording changes.  I updated all (I hope) of the numbers with the pad gas valuation spreadsheet I sent you this morning.

Unfortunately, I couldn't track the changes in the word document.  If you'd prefer to see exactly what Stuart's comments are, I can fax you his mark-up.

Joe, see end of message.

Pig, the cart is in fine shape and has been taken to Austin by Chris and is
being stored at their yard. He advises that it should be retreived promptly,
theft concerns.

Chad and I have been investigating Trailer costs. 400 to 500, unless we get
lucky on a used one and they are scarce and we would still pay 350 for it.

Nobby Tires and lift kit can be done at Mission Equiptment for 800. to do it
ourselves (read chad) will cost at least 500 i guess in parts.

My thoughs. If you are still uncomfortable with transporting in your truck,
then we need to spend the money to get the trailer and drive as is and built
a box on the back. If you think it is ok, then consider spending money to do
tire and suspension job.
I will be in AUstin in a few weeks for depo and will be prepared to bring
unit home in a) purchased trailer b)rented trailer c)pigs truck.
Need to make a decision here.

Joe: Any word on borrowing friends mothers trailer? Any interest in becoming
a part owner? Any chance of being able to borrow Kim's grandfather's big ass
trailer to be pulled by my truck???

Trailer issues per chris, pulling one axle trailer that distance is tricky.
May wobble if load not well balanced. Probably ride better in back of truck
or on longer two axle trailer which will track better.

Our Tennessee report of storage balances, which is printed from Tennessee's system, no longer shows the Citizens storage information.  This is consistent with the Tennessee rep telling us that Citizens revoked their agency (to Enron).  Have you seen a notice of termination yet?

If not, should I call the Citizens contact to inquire?  Should I have an attorney participate in that discussion?

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"Bridgeline","I got a call from Randy Curry who wants to get together with Don and me tomorrow at 2pm.  I haven't checked with Don to see if he is available but they want to talk about our willingness/desire to move forward on the sale of the pad gas to Bridgeline and also our ability/willingness to pay them pre-petition amounts due under ENA storage/transport contracts.  As each of you are aware, they are holding approximately 1.9 BCF of ENA's gas hostage as security for ENA's obligations under the storage/transport contracts.  Gerald is not convinced that they are entitled to do so and my understanding is that a decision has been made to play hard ball with Bridgeline on those s/t contracts.  I wanted to confirm that.  Please let me know.

On the sale of pad gas to Bridgeline, Brian and I need to speak with Gulf South tomorrow morning (as they have expressed an interest in buying the gas directly from us (instead of buying through Bridgeline which is why Bridgeline is interested in buying from us)).  Brian is of the view that by talking to Gulf South we may be able to maximize the amount that is ultimately paid.

I think we still have some legal questions about Louisiana state law the need to be answered in order to make a fully informed decision.  My understanding is that Gerald is working on getting answers to these questions.  Also, Gerald was working on determining what approvals are needed in order to move forward under these potential sales scenarios.

Please let me know what each of you is thinking on these matters.  It probably makes sense to get together to discuss.  How about tomorrow at 1:30pm?  Please let me know if you are available.  Thanks

"Entex","Laurie Ellis in settlements is presently attempting to confirm that we have been paid on our Nov01 invoice.  It was sent to Entex on 1/9/02 and the wire payment was due to Enron on 1/19/02.

If we haven't been paid and Entex is knowingly withholding payment, we need to discuss that with them before we talk about flowing any incremental gas.  I'll let you know as soon as I know more.

Still hope to call Entex later today.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 5/28/2002.

Over the past several weeks, numerous analysts' reports have suggested
there has been a massive destruction of gas demand, as gas prices have
recently moved above $3.50/mcf. We believe the foundation for many of these
reports is both poor analytical methodology and bad data. To conclude that
weather-adjusted natural gas demand has fallen by 5 to 10 bcf per day
implies a demand deterioration level similar to what we saw in early 2001,
when prices soared to near $10 per mcf. Unlike then, today's fuel-switching
incentives still favor natural gas. Secondly, there is little economic
incentive for today's industrial consumers of natural gas to shut down
plants in an improving economic environment. The current economy is very
different than the deteriorating economic environment in early 2001.

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"Gas flow and prepayment schedule through 3/28/02","
I have requested the following payments to made to Reliant on Thur, 3/28/02.

 Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00
This item is NOT included on my worksheet.  I did this deal with Jim Taylor yesterday.

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline $40,000.00 (normal weekly prepay).
Prepay to Reliant for possible intraday supply on Florida (volume up to 10,000 dth per day) $70,000.00.

I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not sure how my cash department will wire the funds.  As of today, ENA has not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not anticipate very much activity on this deal.

Please let me know if anyone has questions.

Thanks

P.S.  Jim, according to Tallahassee, on February 27th that they requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth.  Would you have someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the worksheet please.

Thanks

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

If you have any further questions, please contact Pete Castrejana at 713-410-0642 for more information.

Subject: are you all dead?
 
What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks
again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt.
I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your
spot.

John, mail your check and I will send off with mine and contract for emerick

Departure: E says he is better off leaving Fri a.m.(4 hunts) w/ Sun return.  I was thinking Fri p.m. for more relaxed Monday return(4 hunts)--I'm OK either way, but I need to let John know if I'm out Fri or Mon.

do it man !!!

Most importantly, how did ya'll leave the keg last time--I damn sure don't want to show up Fri. p.m. after being ""IN"" for four hours and have nuthin' but a cup of dust waiting!!
Lets plan ahead on the Al K. Hall issue, remember I'm drinking for two now..(Pig and I).

Food Issue:  Just because Piggy ain't cookin' doesn't mean we have to eat like alternate/persons.  I say we do it right at least on Sat night.(i.e.ribeyes.......)
Sat. a.m.: I made a Mex. egg/cheese/& stuff casserole for x-mas morning that was pretty damn good---I can pre-make it and all we have to do is heat & eat.

...other than that: Scotch, coffee, and firearms.

Subject: Possible new lease member

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

"Enron Names Two New Board Members","This morning, we issued a press release announcing that the Board of Directors has elected two new members, John W. Ballantine and Corbin A. McNeill.  Additionally, the Board announced the resignation of directors Frank Savage and John Mendelsohn.  These changes reflect advancements in the transition plan established by the Board earlier this year.

Mr. Ballantine has been a private investor since 1998, when he left First Chicago NBD Corporation/The First National Bank of Chicago as its chief risk management officer and executive vice president.  Mr. McNeill is the retired chairman and co-CEO of Exelon Corporation, which was formed in October 2000 by the merger of PECO Energy Company and Unicom Corporation.

For more details about our two new board members, you can read the press release at http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/25-053002releaseltr.html.

The Board is continuing to identify and review qualified candidates to join the Board as independent directors.  We expect further resignations of long-standing Board members as new directors are elected to the Board, and we will keep you informed of such changes.

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about our
impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT CHANGE,
heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will be
Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO have
security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers
drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining next
to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of like a
good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the natives
eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and Chet, I
would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the non-English
speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

								PIGGY

Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be

sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

"Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida","Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about
our impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT
CHANGE, heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go
about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will
be Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they
DO have security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day
laborers drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and
lime, dining next to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good
Fun. Kind of like a good noodle house or other oriental type place...if
you see the natives eating there, you know it's good. Besides after
listening to Joe and Chet, I would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT
OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety,
Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the
non-English speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon
arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

"Management Changes","To:  Enron Employees
From:  Office of the Chief Executive
Date:  Friday, February 15, 2002
Re:  Management Changes

With Steve Cooper's appointment as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer, we have begun to focus on the future of Enron and require a management team committed to doing the same.

While certain roles and responsibilities are still being defined, we wanted to share with you some greater detail regarding the company's organizational structure and management team.  The management team is not complete, but currently includes:

?	Stan Horton will continue to manage our pipeline and global asset businesses, including Portland General Electric.  Jim Hughes, reporting to Stan, oversees our international assets.  Peggy Fowler, also reporting to Stan, oversees PGE.

?	Scott Josey oversees our domestic oil and gas exploration and production business, which includes Mariner as well as other North American properties currently held by the wholesale division.

?	Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will manage the liquidation and sale of the Wholesale and Retail trading books.  Jim Fallon and Dan Leff will report to Bob.

?	Mark Muller continues to oversee corporate development activities and will manage all asset sales for Enron going forward.

?	Jordan Mintz will manage the tax department worldwide.

?	Dick Lydecker, reporting to Ray Bowen, will oversee Enron's accounting function.

?	Cindy Olson directs Human Resources, Employee Relations, and Property Services.

?	Mark Palmer continues to manage Public Relations.

?	Greg Piper is the chief information officer for Enron.

Once Enron's management team is completely assembled and we begin to finalize the plan to restructure the company, we will be better able to communicate greater detail about the organization's structure and how each of you will contribute to it.  We appreciate your patience as we work through this challenging, but worthwhile process.

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be
delivered to Enron North America.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is ""zero-rated""  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject:        Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan 

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, ""Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months"".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca 
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him 
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,
we 
can steal some of Henry's.

"RE: Deals Pending Confirmation","I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following;

Deal	 	Counterparty					Comment
1192958	Sequent Energy Management, LP 		approved
1198866	Anadarko Energy Services Company		approved
1195770	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1195777	MidAmerican Energy Company			Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from Sylvia Pollan.
1195767	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1192959	City of Tallahassee				this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract.

I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.  I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either. GRRRR.

Scott, Margaret, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes.

Gerald, 
 
If you haven't heard from Joe on this, please get in touch with him.  
 
Joe - this is a reasonable request given that we need to understand why they feel that they are entitled to hold the gas.  We are not trying to be argumentative but need to understand (and have them articulate a rationale for) why they feel that they can do this.  Once we hear where they are coming from, I think we will be able to get to where everyone wants to go (i.e. settlement and sale of the gas).

Chris,  Can you request that Centana provide us with their lawyers info, so I can contact him.  It is not unreasonable for them to specify the grounds under which they are holding our gas.  They are in violation of the automatic stay is they do not return our gas and I will point this out to their attorney.

Cc:     Parks, Joe 
Subject:        Centana - Colorable Warehouseman's Lien 

Talked to Joe....The counter party has only provided a verbal as to its claim against the gas in ground...nothing written.  Their comments have ranged from ""if you don't pay me for past amounts, we are not going to buy any gas from you"" to ""we are holding the gas till you pay us""  Based on Joe's discussions to date, the proposition of having Centana provide a written claim to stored gas appears small.

Our most probable options appear to be: 

 (1) pay pre petition amounts under the 1st day order based on an implied / colorable warehouseman's lien 
       (post petition amounts are already approved); 
 (2) request a written assertion of Centana's rights and proceed under 1st day order; 
 (3) forget 1 and 2 above and go through the TRC, BMC and CC; 
 (4) Force the issue w/Centana and sell gas in ground to a third party, if available. 

My preference is option (1) as : 
        -       option (2) is the most unlikely, 
        -       option (3) is cumbersome and we are subject to price risk while we continue to accrue storage costs, and

        -       option (4) holds significant transaction risk. 

Regardless of the above, I assume we still need to complete the Batch Funding Request (""BFR""). 

Joe - have you finished the valuation and recommendation portions of the BFR? 

Gerald -  if Centana will not provide a written response, can we proceed with (1) above?

"New Lease Update","Talked to Mertz last night. Take this for whatever it is worth...
Bottom line is that he says the lease I sent him, 16,000 per year for 2002
to 2005 looks good, it is the money he wants, we take good care of his
place, shoot mature bucks and we will get the lease, BUT he won't sign the
lease until next fall, ""because I don't have to"". Whatever.
I said we just wanted to know for certain that we had a place to hunt for
the next four years and wanted to make sure we did not need to start looking
for another lease. He said we had the place and not to worry about it, he
just wanted to see how the new protien program panned out before signing
off. Once again, whatever. He also says he's pouring the stuff out heavy
right now.
He gave me his word and seemed upbeat about everything. I'm going to leave
it at that until next fall. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. His
great deal on the Zander's old lease fell apart on him (he was suppossed to
have out of state hunters show up for two weeks and they were going to pay
him 30k a year). Maybe the concept of some good lessees who pay on time and
take care of his land will look more realistic and attractive.
He, as usual, stressed his never ending desire to grow a big deer. He's
counting on this new super food to do it this year. I guess the best we can
do to assure a lease renewal is to hunt hard and kill him some big deer.
Site in your guns and bring plenty of ammo next fall.
Erik.

"Important Changes to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","
To:  Participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan
From:  Enron Benefits
Re:  Changes to the Savings Plan

Yesterday, the Enron Board of Directors met.  A press release outlining the Board's actions states:

"" ... Enron believes that the total amount of the liquidated, undisputed claims against Enron and its subsidiaries exceeds and will exceed the current fair market value of the consolidated operations and assets of Enron and its subsidiaries.  Consequently, Enron believes that its existing equity does not and will not have value and that any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court will not provide Enron's existing equity with any interest in the reorganized debtor.""

Essentially, this means that any holdings in Enron stock will carry no value as the company reorganizes.  Consequently, the Board also decided that employees participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan should no longer be able to invest contributions into Enron stock (Enron Corp. Stock Fund.)

IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS PLAN

Effective with the February 15, 2002 paycheck, employees who participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan will no longer be able to invest contributions directly into Enron stock.

If your investment election currently includes Enron stock, we strongly encourage you to review the other investment options available and revise your investment elections accordingly.  If you do not actively change your investment elections, any portion of your contribution still allocated to Enron stock will be redirected to Fidelity Freedom 2000, a money market fund, where your investment will remain until you take further action.

Within the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, there are a wide range of investment options to meet your individual investment goals and retirement needs.  Information on other available investment funds, including past performance, is available through the Savings Plan website.  You may elect to contribute to any of these funds in one percent increments.

You may change your investment choices at any time.  Changes are enacted the following business day.

To review and make changes to your investment elections online, visit  <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron>.  To change investment elections via the website, access the ""Change Future Investments"" option from your main account screen.  To review and make changes to your investment elections by phone, call the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.  Follow the instructions to access your account.  Then, follow voice prompts to ""Investment Options.""  From there, select ""Investment Elections"" to make necessary changes.

TRANSFERRING FUNDS WITHIN YOUR SAVINGS PLAN ACCOUNT

This change in investment elections will not affect any existing balances in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund - it only effects future contributions to that fund.  Until March 14, 2002, you will still be able to transfer funds from other investments within the Savings Plan into the Enron Corp. Stock Fund.  However, as set forth in the press release quoted above, the board believes that holdings in Enron stock will carry no value as the company reorganizes.  Consequently, we strongly recommend that employees participating in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan no longer invest in Enron stock.  Effective March 15, 2002, transfers into the Enron Corp. Stock Fund will no longer be allowed from other investments within the Savings Plan.

If you participated in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), you may still elect to roll your ESOP shares directly into Enron stock within the Savings Plan.

At any time, you may transfer funds, including company-matching contributions, out of the Enron Corp. Stock Fund into any of the other investment options available within the Savings Plan.  To transfer funds online, visit <http://resources.hewitt.com/enron> and access the ""Transfer Money"" option from your main account screen.  To transfer funds by phone, listen for the prompts from the ""Investment Options"" to either ""Fund Reallocation"" or ""Fund Transfer"" to change your existing account balances.

As always, we encourage you to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

Subject:	Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

                                         deal on Florida





I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

"RE: MAN NIGHT FINAL PLANS","Make it happen, Chetuck. BTW...whatever happened to your reply about our impending ""foursome""??? Very ""excited""  about the opportunity...

OK...this is the final and definitive MAN NIGHT agenda...it WILL NOT CHANGE, heretofore.

Where?- Tampico Mexican Seafood.  610 to Airline...Right on Airline, Go about 4 blocks, you will pass the Farmers Market and just past that will be Tampico. Queried Zander again about it this morning and he said they DO have security and the clientele is an eclectic mix of Mexican day laborers drinking Mexican beer and those little packets of salt and lime, dining next to large tables of rich blue-blood yuppie types...Good Fun. Kind of like a good noodle house or other oriental type place...if you see the natives eating there, you know it's good. Besides after listening to Joe and Chet, I would agree that Tony's is ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION.

When?- Thursday 2/28- 7:15 pm.

Who?- Head count is as follows...Piggy, Lease Nazi, Captain Safety, Monkey-Noise Boy, Big Boy Chambers (?), Fenner-Weiner(?)

MEN...please RSVP such that we can appropriately ""sign"" to the non-English speaking staff how many Ritas we need to order upon arrival.

See you MEN at the MAN function, to do MAN-typical things.

								PIGGY

Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to

fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot.
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two

spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this

spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

Subject: Flows


In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

Subject: FW: Greenspan Article



      LOS ANGELES--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once again found
himself in legal trouble Monday, when he and several members of his
extensive entourage were arrested for allegedly destroying a penthouse
suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

      Hotel officials say Greenspan, in town to address an annual
convention of Federal Reserve District Bank presidents, caused an estimated
$8,500 in damages to the room, the surrounding hallway and the
swimming-pool area.

      Said Beverly Hills Hotel manager Giles Laurent: ""The television
screen and cabinet had apparently been kicked in. Two chairs were thrown
out the window. The mattress was ripped and its stuffing was flung all over
the room, as well as into the hallway."" Laurent added that minutes before
police arrived, Greenspan, with the help of Deputy Treasury Secretary
Kenneth 
Dam, pushed a vending machine off the balcony overlooking the hotel's
swimming 
pool.

      During his two-day stay at the posh hotel, Greenspan also accumulated
a $781.55 room-service bill, which he has refused to pay until June 1,
when he says interest rates on German 10-year Euro-Bunds will rise to a
more favorable 5.5 percent.

      Witnesses to Greenspan's behavior during the days leading up to
Monday's arrest said the 75-year-old head of the Federal Open Market
Committee was in an unusually volatile mood.

      ""Upon arriving Friday, Mr. Greenspan demanded that four large bowls
of M&Ms be delivered to his room, with all the orange ones removed,""
Beverly Hills Hotel concierge Alexander Poole said. ""Then, when he got to
his room and saw the bowls, he flew into a rage, knocking over lamps and
screaming that he wanted the green M&Ms taken out, not the orange ones.""

      Greenspan got into more trouble Saturday night, when he, Fed
Vice-Chair William J. McDonough and several other members of his inner
circle
visited a trendy L.A. night spot. Clubgoers reported seeing Greenspan, still
high 
off the dollar's rally against the yen last week, shout obscenities and
throw ashtrays 
at the club's DJ. When security personnel attempted to restrain him,
Greenspan became
belligerent, yelling, ""I'm Alan F***ing Greenspan,"" and vowing to put
bouncer Frank Rizzo in a ""hurt bracket."" The incident is already being
compared to his infamous July 1997 fistfight with John Kenneth Galbraith at
New York's China Club.

<<Greenspan_drunk015.jpg>>

Above: The famous Beverly Hills Hotel, site of the Fed chief's latest brush
with the law.

      According to Federal Reserve Board insiders, Greenspan, buoyed by the
U.S. economy's recent turn-around has grown increasingly megalomaniacal 
in recent months.

      ""He'll spend hours talking about how he's the greatest economist who
ever lived, how he's 'bigger than Keynes,'"" said one member of the Fed
Board of Governors who wished to remain anonymous. ""Every time he talks 
about single-handedly saving America from potential economic ruin following 
the Sept. 11th tragedy by manipulating interest rates, his bloated ego just
swells 
even more. It's just the sort of irrational exuberance he himself once
warned against.""

      Monday's arrest is only the latest in a long string of legal troubles
for the controversial Greenspan, who has had 22 court dates since becoming
Fed chief in 1987. Economists recall his drunken 1994 appearance on CNN's
Moneyline, during which he unleashed a profanity-laden tirade against
Bureau of Engraving & Printing director Larry Rolufs and punched host Lou
Dobbs when he challenged Greenspan's reluctance to lower interest rates. In
November 1993, he was arrested after running shirtless through D.C.
traffic while waving a gun. And some world-market watchers believe the
international gold standard has still not recovered from a May 1998
incident in which he allegedly exposed his genitals on the floor of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.

      Greenspan's latest quandary now involves women and minorities.  When
asked
about U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's speech at the Women
Entrepreneurs
Conference on March 19th, Greenspan was overheard saying ""What a waste of
Paul's
time.  Women and business don't go together.  Just look at what Elaine
[Chao, U.S. 
Secretary of Labor] has done for our labor markets.  She's just making my
life hell.  
She's the perfect example of why affirmative action doesn't work.""

How much longer can Greenspan last in his position?  Only time will tell.
But, he's 
looking more and more like a ticking time bomb.

 <<IENER010702BSOW.PDF>>

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 01/07/02.

Recent energy investment sentiment could be characterized as a fear-driven,
cautious psychology that has led to a generally under-owned condition for
most energy stocks.  A major contributor to this negative psychology has
been the underlying belief of investors that ""energy stocks always bottom
several times before a sustained upward move.""  While that was true in the
1998/1999 downturn, we are convinced that today's energy fundamentals are
far different than those experienced in the downturn several years ago.  In
fact, we believe today's environment is much more similar to that
experienced in the 1972/1974 timeframe, when energy stocks experienced a
two-year run-up followed by a recession and subsequent nine month sell off.
In the 1974 downturn, however, the stocks experienced one bottom in the
late fall and never looked back.  Likewise, we are convinced that energy
stocks have already seen their lowest levels and as strong commodity
fundamentals become visible later in the first quarter, the stocks will
begin to run.  In other words, we believe the energy stocks are near the
bottom of a cyclical downturn within what we believe is going to be a
longer-term secular upswing.  That means that now is the time to be buying
energy stocks!

It all should work fine now. Sorry for the confusion on our part.

No, I can set you up on the web this afternoon and we can call this next
week your free trial!

I'll send info to our web support right now. It should be up late this
afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Let's do this:

Please use all lower case, since it will be cap-sensitive.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll have someone checking my e-mail

Greg,

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Matt,

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the
noon update, 1 page.  I also had a question, does this package include the
forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need
clarification on that.


Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks very much.

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

Take care,

Matt,


My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a
parternship between Chevron/Texaco and Enron.  We previously received your
energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a
small shop of 5 traders, we operate a pipeline in Louisiana and want to
continue the service.


Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone
nummber is 832-851-2806.


Thanks


Greg Schockling

"RE: are you all dead?","I heard an interview w/ Geddy and Alex, and they said they were dropping some songs they have been playing on the past several tours to play some much older stuff.  Although, the last tour was very cool when they played the whole side one of 2112 all the way through.
 
Yes, Ted has been the coolest person I've ever seen in concert.  Not the best concert, but that guy is just cool... and, I've always wanted a loin cloth like his.

$1000 (per couple) not including food.  Our thought are to leave on June 13
and return on June 16 so we would be there over our anniversary.  I am
thinking of taking that whole week off if we decide to go to Fredericksburg

family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch
Company
buried in my ""in box"". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz

mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying
""thanks"".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the
last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next

year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet
does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He
and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002
to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.

"Update to Bus Pass Information","
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

"report from Keith","
Forwarding Kieth's report from last weekend of doe season.

Had to call him to get information on what made his heart race.

He saw Mertz's rib cage buck at boneyard, other side of the fence, said it 
was 14 inches wide with tines that were incredibly long almost touching at 
the top. he said 140plus, no problem.

saw brian's deer's younger brother at lonestar and said it will be a great 
bucknext year.

While spotlighting bunnys saw a buck at the protien feeder at launching pad 
that was unbelivable. He said he counted 12 scorable points, not including 
several kickers he did not count. the deer was wide with aobut 8 to 9 inch 
tines. walked with a limp on front right leg. Must be a nocturnal old 
warrior, never seen before.

other than that he saw a smattering of does and yong bucks. feeders still 
running.  e.
